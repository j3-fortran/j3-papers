1. Introduction

Please remove blank pages in the body of the text
and between Annexes.
The only blank pages allowed are after the front
matter so that the "Scope" page is on an odd page,
and one after the Bibliography so the last page of
the document is an even number.


2. Response

Accepted.


3. Edits to N2146

Redefine the \jclearpage macro to be \clearpage
(\clearpage just goes to the next page, not to the next odd page).

If necessary, add a new macro with the old definition so that the "Scope"
page ends up on an odd page.
