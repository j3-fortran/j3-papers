Subject:    Edits for renaming defined operators, M7
References: J3/98-158

Paper 158 passed the specs and syntax for renaming defined operators on a USE statement.  This
paper has the edits necessary.

Page 224, line 35+  Add to R1110 to rename
Add "  or	OPERATOR(local-defined-operator) => OPERATOR(use-defined-operator)"

Page 224, line 40+  Add to R1113 only-rename
Add "  or	OPERATOR(local-defined-operator) => OPERATOR(use-defined-operator)"

Page 224, line 40+, In the constraints after R1113 add

"Constraint:  Each use-defined-operator shall be a public defined-unary-op or defined-binary-op in
the module

Constraint:  local-defined-operator shall be a defined-unary-op (R703) or a defined-binary-op
(R723) and shall not be the same as any intrinsic-operator or logical-literal-constant."

Page 225, line 11, after "generic-specs" add ", use-defined-operators,"

Page 225, line 14, delete "named" (because operators don't have names.)

Page 225, line 16, change "local names" to "local identifiers" and then change "names" to
"identifiers"

Page 225, line 18, add before the comma
"or the defined-operator if an OPERATOR generic spec appears,

Page 225, line 19, after local-names add "or local-defined-operators"

Page 225, line 21, before each "name" add "defined-operator or"

Page 225, line 23, after "generic interfaces" add "or defined operators"

Page 225, lines 23 through 36 (except line 29 in note 11.8).  Change all occurrences of "name" or
"names" to "identifier" or "identifiers".

Page 225, line 29 in note 11.8.  After "use-name" add " or use-defined-operator"

Page 225, lines 42 through 46.  Change "name" to "identifier".
