1. Introduction

Unresolved Technical Issue TR13 points out that the value of
CFI_VERSION should be described as being processor dependent.


2. Discussion

Review TR 5.2.5 reveals other problems, in particular:
- CFI_RANK is not described as processor-dependent;
- CFI_VERSION is said to be an integer constant expression and
  subsequently said to be an integer constant;
- hyphens used inappropriately (should have been en or em dashes, but
  anyway these are replaced by the edits below);
- the macro descriptions are not sentences.

Edits are supplied to correct these problems.

Also, an edit is supplied to improve readability:
- it is unclear which macros are being talked about in p1;
- "evaluates to" could be misunderstood.


3. Edits to N1838

[11:12] "following macros" -> "macros described in this subclause".
{Improve readability.}

[11:12] "evaluates to"->"expands to".
{Improve readability.  Note that "expands to" is used by C99 itself
 when talking about what the offset_of macro expands to.}

[11:14] After "CFI_CDESC_T",
        Change "-" to "is".
{Turn it into a sentence.}

[11:16+] Move Note 5.2 to follow p2 (the discussion of CFI_CDESC_T).

[11:17] After "CFI_MAX_RANK",
        Change "- a" to "has a processor-dependent".

[11:18] After "CFI_VERSION",
        Change "- an integer constant"
        to "has a processor-dependent value".

[11:19+0] Delete UTI TR13.
