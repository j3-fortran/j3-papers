Subject: C interop

NUMBER: F03/0074
TITLE: Type mismatch for C character arguments
KEYWORDS: Interoperability, dummy procedures
DEFECT TYPE: CLARIFICATION/ERRATUM
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Is the following conforming if C_CHAR is not the same as default character kind:

interface
   subroutine sub(string) bind(c)
      character(c_char) :: string(*)
   end subroutine   
end interface

character(kind=c_char,len=10) :: string
call sub(string)

The second and 3rd paras of 12.4.1.2 do not treat C character kind the
same as default character kind, and seem to require matching types
between the actual and dummy. This makes Note 15.23 nonconforming if
C_CHAR is not the same as default character kind, and is also not in
sync with 270:25-26.

ANSWER:

Yes, this is conforming, the omission in 12.4.1.2 is accidental.

EDITS:

In the second and 3rd paras of 12.4.1.2, replace "of type default
character" with "of type default character, of type character with the C
character kind (15.1),"
