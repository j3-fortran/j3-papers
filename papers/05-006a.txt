Table of Contents

Part 0 contains the summary status of all of the Fortran
       interpretations

Part 1 contains the interpretation processing rules from 00-142

Part 2 contains F95 interpretation 000000e (typographical interps),
       interpretations 1-32 and 66-103

Part 3 contains the remaining F90 interpretations left over, with
       their F90 interp numbers (prefixed with "F90/")

       Exceptions: 000200 was already subsumed by 000202 and so does
                          not appear.
                   000202 was replaced by F95/000012 at meeting 143.
                   Note: F90/000202 history added to F95/000012
                         history.

       Note: Additionally to those noted in 00-126, F90 interps
             000206-000212 are included

Part 1: Interpretation Processing Rules
======================================================================

0. All interpretations are listed in J3 standing document 006.

1. Interpretations are processed by the J3/interp group and given a
   number.  The interpretation is marked "J3 consideration in
   progress".  An answer is formulated and presented to J3 in a
   meeting paper.

2. J3 votes on the answer at a J3 meeting; a simple majority vote
   marks the answer as "passed by J3 meeting".

3. Between J3 meetings the chair of /interp sends a J3 letter ballot
   to J3 to approve interp answers that have been "passed by J3
   meeting".  The letter ballot runs for 30 days.  Not voting on
   three of four consecutive J3 letter ballots is grounds to
   terminate J3 membership.  An interp answer passes by a 2/3rds
   vote; a no vote must be accompanied by an explanation of the
   changes necessary to change the member's vote to yes.

   J3/interp reserves the right to recall an interp answer for more
   study even if the answer passes.

4. The chair of J3/interp gathers all interp answers that are marked
   "passed by J3 letter ballot" and forwards them to the WG5
   convenor.  The WG5 convenor holds a ballot of individual members;
   a no vote must be accompanied by an explanation of the changes
   necessary to change the member's vote to yes.  The answers that
   pass this ballot become "WG5 approved".

   J3/interp reserves the right to recall an interp answer for more
   study even if the answer passes.

5. "WG5 approved" answers are processed into a corrigendum document
   by taking the edits from the interp answers and putting them in
   the format required by ISO.  A WG5 vote is made on forwarding the
   corrigendum to SC22.  Interps so forwarded are marked
   "Corrigendum".

6. J3/interp creates a edit for the next Fortran Standard if one is
   needed for all interps marked "Corrigendum".

Part 2: Correctly numbered F95 interpretations
======================================================================

NUMBER: 00000e
TITLE: Rejected Minor edits and corrections
KEYWORDS: typographical errors
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION: Should the following be added to the list of edits?

 8. In 13.13.85 RANGE

        change 'Returns the decimal exponent range in the model ...'
            to 'Returns the upper bound of the decimal exponent range
                of the model ...' [228:20]

    Rationale(1): a range has two values; RANGE returns only one.

    Rationale(2): there is not a decimal range in the model, see
                  13.7.1, but a decimal range can be calculated. Thus
                  the change from 'in' to 'of'.

 9. In 13.13.79 PRECISION

        change 'Returns the decimal precision in the model ...'
            to '............................. of .............' at
            [226:4]

    Rationale: same as for RANGE, above.

ANSWER:

This item collects failed "minor edits and corrections" so that the
reasons for failing them can be recorded for historical purposes. No
further voting is needed for items in this list.

No, 8 and 9 should not be added.  The use of 'range' is consistent
with other uses in the standard and is meant to convey an entire
range of values not just 2.  The change from 'in' to 'of' is too
small a change to be included at this time and would best be
addressed in a future standard.

NUMBER: 000004
TITLE: Value returned by MAXVAL/MINVAL
KEYWORDS: MAXVAL, MINVAL
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

The Result Value section of the MAXVAL intrinsic function description
uses the phrasing:

  or has the value of the negative number of the largest magnitude
  supported by the processor for numbers of the type and kind type
  parameter of ARRAY if ARRAY has size zero

This phrasing has generated at least the two following views on the
return value:

 * If the machine supports the IEEE standard then the implementation
   should return -inf.
 * For portability, the implementation should return -HUGE(ARRAY).

These views lead to the following questions:

1. Is the intent of the standard to describe the result in terms of
   machine values rather than model values?

2. If the answer to 1 is "yes", how are programmers expected to use
   this intrinsic function portably?

ANSWER:

1.   Yes.  Processors may support values that are not present in the
model of 13.7.1.  IEEE -inf is an example of such a number and this
may be returned on a machine that supports the IEEE standard.  If the
negative number of the largest magnitude in the model had been
intended, the model would have been mentioned as, for example, in the
definition of HUGE (13.14.39).

2.   A simple example of its use is to test whether a set of numbers
SET1 has a value greater than any value in the set SET2.  Consider
the expression MAXVAL (SET1) > MAXVAL (SET2).  If SET1 is empty and
SET2 is not, this value is correctly false even if all of the values
are outside the model with values less than -HUGE (SET1).

     All of the reduction functions (e.g., MAXVAL, SUM) return values
when the arguments are zero-sized arrays that may be the same as the
values returned for some non-zero-sized arguments.

NOTE:

The NO votes in 00-254 were concerned that IEEE Infinities are not
model numbers and are therefore not valid results for MINVAL and
MAXVAL.  The IEEE 754 standard is neither integrated into nor
required by Fortran 95. However concessions were made to allow some
IEEE exceptional values to be used by standard-conforming processors,
like limited support for -0.0.

Fortran 2003 uses the same words in MAXVAL and MINVAL as in Fortran
95.

NUMBER: 000006
TITLE: Character length specification of a function result
KEYWORDS: character, function result
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

      PROGRAM main
      CHARACTER(8) arg, func
      EXTERNAL func
      CALL sub(arg, func)
      END PROGRAM

      SUBROUTINE sub(arg, func)
      CHARACTER(*) arg, func
      CHARACTER(8) str
      str = func(arg)
      ...
      END SUBROUTINE

      CHARACTER(8) FUNCTION func(arg)
      CHARACTER(*) arg
      ...
      END FUNCTION

Some implementations reject the reference to FUNC in subroutine SUB
and some do not.  The implementations that do not reject the reference
to FUNC use essentially the following as the argument for allowing
the reference:

  The rules for when an asterisk can be used to specify character
  length are specified in section 5.1.1.5 (middle of page 51 of
  the Fortran 95 standard).

    * The first rule states that an asterisk may be used to declare a
      dummy argument of a procedure.  It is clear that FUNC is a
      dummy argument of SUB.

    * The third rule says that in an external function, the length of
      the result may be specified within the function itself with an
      asterisk but if the result length is so specified, any invoker
      of the function must specify the character length of the
      function result as something other than an asterisk.  But the
      function that is being invoked in the above example does not
      declare its result length using the asterisk, so this rule does
      not apply.

Is the above sample program a standard conforming program with
respect to the concept of declaring the function result length in the
invoking program as an asterisk?

ANSWER:

Yes. When item (1) on page 51 is applied to the argument func of sub,
it tells us that its length is 8 for the call from the main program.

NOTE:

The NO votes in 01-380 raised the concern that this answer introduced
a binary incompatibility with FORTRAN 77.  FORTRAN 77 features
continue to work in Fortran 95;  Fortran 95 features may not always
work in FORTRAN 77.

the optional arguments [, A3, ...] in the MAX and MIN functions.  In
the Fortran 90 standard, the MAX/MIN descriptions said "optional
arguments.  A3, ...", but those words do not appear 13.14.64 of the
Fortran 95 standard.

Section 13.3 [217:27+] states

  ...optional arguments... are identified by the notation "optional"
  in the argument descriptions.

and goes on to describe another notation for the arguments that are
listed as optional.  But it doesn't say anything about arguments
given in [...] and NOT also listed as optional.

Suggested change to the argument descriptions for MAX and MIN:

Arguments.
A1, A2     shall both have the same type which shall be integer or
           real and they shall both have the same kind type parameter.

A3, ... (optional)  shall have the same type and kind type parameter
           as A1.

ANSWER:

There is an anomaly in the presentation of MAX and MIN but the intent
is clear, ie, dummy arguments A3 and beyond are optional.

EDITS:  None

NOTE:

The same descriptive form reported here in Fortran 95 appears in
Fortran 2003 for MAX and MIN.

KEYWORDS: Characteristics, function
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

Sections 12.2.1.1 and 12.2.2 of the Fortran 95 standard define rules
for dummy arguments and function returns in the presence of explicit
interfaces that allow array bounds expressions to be evaluated on
either the calling side or the called side of a call.  The
interpretation provided for RFI 000049 on the X3J3 website clarifies
and reinforces the conditions that permit evaluation on either side
of the call.  The erratum published in the same file for RFI 000070
changes the semantics of dummy arguments.  The erratum does not
explicitly mention function results, but it might be considered to
imply a similar change to the semantics of function results.

The erratum provided for RFI 000070 refers to altered text for the
interpretation provided for RFI 000049.  The version of the
interpretation that appears in the file on the X3J3 website does not
contain the altered text.

The definition of characteristics of function results as stated in
Section 12.2.2 of the Fortran 95 standard permits more efficient
implementation of array-valued functions, at least for some
architectures, than the definition implied by the erratum provided
for RFI 000070.  For Sun, it is more efficient for the calling
routines to allocate space for array results than to have the called
routines allocate the space.  In order for the calling routine to
allocate space for an array result, it must know the size of the
array.  To determine the size of the array, it must evaluate the
array bounds expressions given in the explicit interface for the
function.

Section 12.2.2 of the Fortran 95 standard requires the values of the
nonconstant bounds expressions given in an explicit interface to be
the same as the values of the bounds expressions given in the
corresponding function definition.  Thus, the values of the
nonconstant bounds expressions used to determine the size of the
array result can be passed to the called routine, avoiding any need
for the called routine to re-evaluate those expressions. Because
Fortran 95 allows user-defined routines to appear in bounds
expressions, evaluating the bounds expressions more than once per
call could prove inefficient and confusing.

The change implied by the erratum provided for RFI 000070 would
remove the nonconstant bounds expressions from the characteristics of
function results. The shape would still be a characteristic, but the
same shape can be produced by many different values of the bounds
expressions.  Thus, the values of the nonconstant bounds expressions
used in the called routine may differ from the values of the
corresponding expressions in the explicit interface.

For example, consider the explicit interface

      INTERFACE
        FUNCTION FOO(F, G, H)
          INTERFACE
            PURE INTEGER FUNCTION F()
            END FUNCTION
            PURE INTEGER FUNCTION G()
            END FUNCTION
            PURE INTEGER FUNCTION H()
            END FUNCTION
          END INTERFACE
          CHARACTER*(F()) FOO(G():H())
        END FUNCTION
      END INTERFACE

The definition given in Section 12.2.2 of the Fortran 95 standard
requires the values of the length and bounds expressions in the
interface to be the same as the values of the corresponding length
and bounds expressions in the function definition.

Under the definition implied by the erratum provided for RFI 000070,
the shapes must match, but the values of the nonconstant bounds
expressions need not. Thus, the function definition might be

      FUNCTION FOO(F, G, H)
        INTERFACE
          PURE INTEGER FUNCTION F()
          END FUNCTION
          PURE INTEGER FUNCTION G()
          END FUNCTION
          PURE INTEGER FUNCTION H()
          END FUNCTION
        END INTERFACE
        CHARACTER*(F()) FOO(G()-1:H()-1)
        . . .
      END FUNCTION

In this case, the values of the bounds expressions used in the called
routine must be the values of the expressions specified in the
function definition, not the values of the expressions specified in
the interface block.

QUESTION:

If a bound of a function result array is not a constant expression,
is the exact dependence on the entities in the expression a
characteristic of the function result?

ANSWER:

No. According to Corrigendum 1, the correct statement is now:

"If a bound of a function result array is not an initialization
expression, the exact dependence on the entities in the expression is
a characteristic of the function result."

TITLE: Termination of the previous record by a WRITE statement
KEYWORDS: Nonadvancing, Record termination, WRITE
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Suppose a sequential formatted file is positioned within a record as
a result of a nonadvancing READ.

1. If the next operation performed on the file is a WRITE, can the
   current record be terminated at its current position before the
   next record is written?  Section 9.2.1.3.2 appears to preclude the
   record from being terminated, but at least one Fortran 90
   implementation does the record in such an instance.

2. If next operation is a nonadvancing WRITE and the number of
   characters written does not extend to the end of the current
   record, are the remaining characters at the end of the record
   preserved?

ANSWER:

1. No.  If the current record were to be terminated, the file
   position would be changed.  Section 9.2.1.3.2 [136:37-39] states:
   "For sequential access on input, if there is a current record, the
   file position is not changed.  Otherwise, the file is positioned
   at the beginning of the next record and this record becomes the
   current record."

2. Yes.  The remaining characters in the record are preserved.

   Consider the following different, but related, example:

        program write_write
        write (10,"(a,t1,a,a)") "XXXXXXXXX", "ABC", "DEF"
        write (10,"(a,t1,a)",advance='no') "XXXXXXXXX", "ABC"
        write (10,"(a)") "DEF"
        end

   The output from this program is

        ABCDEFXXX
        ABCDEFXXX

   From the description of Position editing (10.6.1) it is clear
   that the output following the tab does not cause the deletion
   of the final XXX characters from the record.  The fact that the
   second output record is created by a non-advancing write
   followed by an advancing write is not operationally different
   from the single advancing write that created the first record.

   The fundamental difference between this example and the question
   considered in the interp is the mechanism by which the current
   location in the record is established prior to the final
   advancing write statement. It would be inconsistent to have one
   case preserve previously existing characters in the record and
   the other case to require the opposite.  To avoid this
   inconsistency, the answer to Question 2 is Yes.

TITLE: Ordering requirements on definition of specification functions
KEYWORDS: Specification expressions, specification functions
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Consider the following program unit.

      MODULE MOD
        INTERFACE INT
          MODULE PROCEDURE F1, F2
        END INTERFACE
      CONTAINS
        INTEGER PURE FUNCTION F1(I)
          INTEGER :: A(INT(1_4)), B(INT(1_2))    ! A(1), B(19)
          INTEGER, PARAMETER :: KIND = SIZE(A)   ! KIND == 1
          INTEGER(KIND), INTENT(IN) :: I

          F1 = 17
        END FUNCTION F1

        INTEGER PURE FUNCTION F2(J)
          INTEGER :: C(INT(2_4))                 ! C(2)
          INTEGER, PARAMETER :: KIND = SIZE(C)   ! KIND == 2
          INTEGER(KIND), INTENT(IN) :: J

          F2 = 19
        END FUNCTION F2
      END MODULE MOD

In processing the references to "INT(1_4)" and "INT(1_2)" in F1, the
processor needs to determine whether the references are to the
intrinsic function, INT, or to one of the specific procedures, F1 or
F2.  Determining that requires the processor to have determined the
kind type parameter of the dummy argument J, of F2.  In turn, that
requires the processor to determine whether the reference to
"INT(2_4)" is a reference to the intrinsic function, INT, or to one
of the specific procedures, F1 or F2.  Determining that requires the
processor to determine the kind type parameter of the dummy argument
I, which requires it to determine that "INT(1_4)" in F1 was a
reference to the intrinsic function INT.

After all this is determined, the processor can determine that the
reference to "INT(1_2)" in the declaration of B in F1 is a reference
to the specification function F2.

According to 7.1.6.1 [94:38-41],

     "If an initialization expression includes a reference to an
      inquiry function for a type parameter or an array bound of an
      object specified in the same <specification-part>, the type
      parameter or array bound shall be specified in a prior
      specification of the <specification-part>.  The prior
      specification may be to the left of the inquiry function in the
      same statement."

According to 7.1.6.2 [96:27-37],

     "A variable in a specification expression shall have its type and
      type parameters, if any, specified by a previous declaration in
      the same scoping unit, or by the implicit typing rules in effect
      for the scoping unit, or by host or use association.  If a
      variable in a specification expression is typed by the implicit
      typing rules, its appearance in any subsequent type declaration
      statement shall confirm the implied type and type parameters.

      If a specification expression includes a reference to an inquiry
      function for a type parameter or an array bound of an entity
      specified in the same <specification-part>, the type parameter
      or array bound shall be specified in a prior specification of
      the <specification-part>.  The prior specification may be to
      the left of the inquiry function reference in the same
      statement.  If a specification expression includes a reference
      to the value of an element of an array specified in the same
      <specification-part>, the array shall be completely specified
      in prior declarations."

The rules regarding references to variables in a specification
expressions and initialization expressions require a strict
left-to-right, top-to-bottom ordering between specification and
inquiry.  Specification functions appear to be unrestricted in this
respect.

Assuming that the processor supports integers with kind type
parameters of 1, 2 and 4, was it the intent of the committee that the
program unit above should be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

No, it is not the intent that the above program unit be standard
conforming.  The required complexity of implementation is not
justified.  The standard has no prohibition against it, but the
lack of such a prohibition was an oversight.  The edits below
correct this oversight.

EDITS:

Add the following new paragraph immediately before Note 7.14:

  If an initialization expression in a module includes a reference to
  a generic, that generic shall have no specific procedures defined
  in the module subsequent to the initialization expression.

Add the following new paragraph immediately before Note 7.16:

  If a specification expression in a module includes a reference to

According to 12.4.1 [200:30-32],

    "If a dummy argument is not a pointer and the corresponding
     actual argument is a pointer, the actual argument shall be
     currently associated with a target and the dummy argument
     becomes argument associated with that target."

According to 12.4.1 [201:19-21],

    "If a dummy argument has INTENT(OUT) or INTENT(INOUT), the actual
     argument shall be definable."

According to 5.1.2.3 [53:29-31],

    "The INTENT(OUT) attribute specifies that. . . any actual
     argument that becomes associated with such a dummy argument
     shall be definable."

The definition of "definable" supplied in Annex A (the term does not
appear to be defined in normative text) is:

    "A variable is <<definable>> if its value may be changed by the
     appearance of its <name> or <designator> on the left of an
     <assignment statement>."

According to this definition, "definable" is a property of variables
only.  In the example above, the actual argument is not a variable.
However, the actual argument is pointer associated with an object
that is definable.  The text cited from 5.1.2.3 refers to the
"actual argument that becomes associated with the dummy argument",
but the first piece of text cited from 12.4.1 makes it clear that
when the actual argument is a pointer, it is the target with which
it is associated that becomes argument associated with the dummy
argument, and not the actual argument itself.

Was it the intent of the committee that this program should not be
standard-conforming?

Question:

1.   Does the Fortran 95 standard require the external unit
     corresponding to the I/O unit identified by an asterisk for
     input or output to be the same as the external unit identified
     by some fixed nonnegative integer value?

2.   Can the I/O unit identified by an asterisk for input or output
     correspond to more than one external unit?

3.   If the external unit identified by an integer value that
     corresponds to the I/O unit identified by an asterisk for input
     or output is closed, does that cause the I/O unit identified by
     an asterisk to become disconnected?

ANSWER:

     1.   No.

     2.   No.

     3.   Not addressed by Fortran 95.

DISCUSSION:

The submitter states:  At least one Fortran 95 implementation uses -1
as the value of the I/O unit identified by an asterisk.  A carefully
constructed INQUIRE statement can expose this value to the user.  Many
users expect I/O to the units identified by asterisks to continue to
work even after the corresponding units identified by integer values
have been closed.

     1.   There is no requirement in the standard that the asterisk
correspond to an external-file-unit; it is, however, permissible.

     2.   For the units identified by the asterisk, the text of
section 9.3.2 does not allow two or more units to be connected
simultaneously to the same file [139:8-9].

     3.   Fortran 95 does not specify the behavior in this instance.

  END SUBROUTINE
END

Is this program standard-conforming, and if so, what value is
printed?

The real question is whether an expression argument that is a pointer
function reference is treated as a variable (data-object) argument
with the variable being the target of the pointer expression.  (Or
whether it is dereferenced as usual in the absence of POINTER dummy
arguments).

Re (statement 1), the question is whether VARIABLE is definable when
argument-associated with "F()".

Re (statement 2), if the previous answer was Yes (VARIABLE is
definable), then presumably it can be made INTENT(OUT).  A random
sample of 4 compilers revealed that they considered it not to be
definable.

Re (statement 3), the question is whether P is pointer-associated
with X, not pointer-associated with X, or processor-dependent.  Of
the same random sample 3 thought it was associated with X, 1 thought
not.

ANSWER:

1. The call to s1 is not standard conforming. 12.5.2.1 says:

'A dummy data object whose intent is not specified is subject to the
limitations of the data entity that is the associated actual
argument.  That is, a reference to the dummy data object may occur
if the actual argument is defined and the dummy data object may be
defined if the actual argument is definable.'

Here the actual argument is a function result, which is not
definable.  For example, it is not permitted on the left-hand side
of an assignment statement, since it is not a variable.  (Being
"defined" or "undefined" is fundamentally a concept that applies only
to variables.)

2. The call to s2 is not standard conforming. 12.4.1.1 says:

'If a dummy argument has INTENT(OUT) or INTENT(INOUT), the actual
argument shall be definable.'

Again the actual argument is a function result, which is not
definable.

3. The call to s3 is standard conforming and the pointer assignment
in s3 causes p and x to become associated. This may be deduced from
12.4.1.1, which says [200:38-42]:

'If the dummy argument has the TARGET attribute and is either scalar
or is an assumed-shape array, and the corresponding actual argument
has the TARGET attribute but is not an array section with a vector
subscript (1) Any pointers associated with the actual argument become
associated with the corresponding dummy argument on invocation of the
procedure ...'

According to rule (1)(a), SIN is established to be generic; thus
references are resolved by the rules in 14.1.2.4.1.

In 14.1.2.4.1:
   Rule (1) fails - the reference is not consistent with any
            specific interface in the interface block for SIN.
   Rule (2) fails for the same reason.
   Rule (3) fails because there is no INTRINSIC statement.
   Rule (4) fails because there is no host scoping unit.

Is this program legal?
How should the reference to the generic procedure be resolved?

ANSWER:

This program was intended to be valid.
The reference is to the intrinsic SIN.
An edit is supplied to clarify this.

DISCUSSION:

(1) INTERFACE OPERATOR(+) does not hide the intrinsic operator.
(2) CHARACTER SIN does not hide the intrinsic function.

Given that, it would seem perverse for
    INTERFACE SIN
to completely block the intrinsic.  Indeed, according to interp
F90/000054 the intrinsic is still accessible in this kind of
situation.

Furthermore, it is clear from the original version of Fortran 90 that
a user generic was not intended to hide the intrinsic.  This text was
modified by interpretation F90/000083 which allowed the user to
override an intrinsic function by providing a specific function with
the same argument characteristics.  The failure of the current
14.1.2.4.1 to resolve the above example was an inadvertent side-effect
of that change.

EDITS:

[279:36+] Append new paragraph
  "If (1), (2), (3) and (4) do not apply, the name is that of an
intrinsic procedure, and the reference is consistent with the
interface of that intrinsic procedure, then the reference is to that
intrinsic procedure."

TITLE: End-of-record and PAD
KEYWORDS: End-of-record, PAD
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

Subclause 9.4.3 specifies:

  If an end-of-record condition occurs during execution of a
  nonadvancing input statement, the following occurs: if the PAD=
  specifier has the value YES, the record is padded with blanks
  (9.4.4.4.2) to satisfy the input list item and corresponding data
  edit descriptor that require more characters than the record
  contains;

There appears to be a problem if a list item does not correspond to
exactly one edit descriptor.

QUESTION:

If an End-of-record condition occurs during execution of a
nonadvancing input statement and the PAD= specifier has the value YES

  (1) do enough blanks get supplied for the next data edit descriptor
      and whatever part of the list item corresponds to that edit
      descriptor, or
  (2) do enough blanks get supplied for the remainder of the list item
      and as many edit descriptors as necessary, or
  (3) do enough blanks get supplied to process the rest of the input
      list?

ANSWER:

The situation can only arise for list items of complex type, because
list items of derived type are processed as if their components had
appeared as list items -- see [149:8-10].  It is clear from text at
[150:15] and [153:13] that blanks are not supplied for more than one
list item.  So the answer to part (3) of the question is "no".  Since
the texts at [150:15] and [153:13] also refer to a single format item,
this leaves the answer to parts (1) and (2) of the question ambiguous:
Is it one list item, or one edit descriptor?

The answer is that enough blanks are supplied by the processor to
satisfy all of the edit descriptors for a list item.

TITLE: Are dummy functions returning assumed-length character legal?
KEYWORDS: DUMMY FUNCTION, ASSUMED-LENGTH CHARACTER
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Duplicate of interp #6

QUESTION: Are dummy functions returning assumed-length character
          legal?

Consider the following program:

        character*5 f
        external f
          call ss3(f)
        end
        subroutine ss3(ff)
        character*(*) ff, a*10
        external ff
          a = ff()//'99999999'
          print *, '<', a, '>'
        end
        function f()
        character*(*) f
          f = '123'
        end

The issue is the call to the dummy function 'ff' in subroutine 'ss3'.
Some compilers issue an error message. Others print the result:

 <123  99999>

There appear to be two relevant, contradictory passages in the F95
standard. Refer to section 5.1.1.5. <> means italics, [] means
obsolescent font.

The third constraint says "A function name shall not be declared with
an asterisk <char-len-param-value> [unless it is the name of the
result of an external function or the name of a dummy function.]

Before note 5.6 on the next page, the third bullet says:
(3) [In an external function, the name of the function result may be
specified with a character length parameter value of *; in this case,
any scoping unit invoking the function shall declare the function
name with a character length parameter value other than * or access
such a definition by host or use association. When the function is
invoked, the length of the result variable in the function is assumed
from the value of this type parameter.]

According to the standard, the use in the example program is legal,
because 'ff' is the name of a dummy function. But it seems clear that
the standard intended that the length of the variable returned by
a character function be known at compile time; it is not known in the
case where the function is a dummy function.

TITLE: STAT= variable requirements in ALLOCATE
KEYWORDS: ALLOCATE, STAT=
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

QUESTION:

[79:40-41] says
  "The <stat-variable> shall not appear in a bound in the same
   ALLOCATE statement."

This requirement appears, on the face of it, to apply to the syntax,
not to whichever actual variable is identified by the syntax.

Question 1:

Given
  INTEGER :: A(10) = (/ (i,i=1,10) /)
  POINTER P(:)
  READ *,I,J
  ALLOCATE(P(A(I)),STAT=A(J))

Is the ALLOCATE standard-conforming, or does it depend on the relative
values of I and J?

From the quoted text, it would appear that it is always conforming,
even when I==J.

Question 2:

Similarly, given:
  EQUIVALENCE(I,J)
  POINTER P(:)
  I = 5
  ALLOCATE(P(I),STAT=J)

is the ALLOCATE conforming?

Question 3:

Similarly, given:
  POINTER P(:)
  INTRINSIC DIGITS
  I = 5
  ALLOCATE(P(DIGITS(I)),STAT=I)

is the ALLOCATE conforming?

From the quoted text, it would appear not to be conforming, despite
the non-dependence of the array bound on the value of the STAT=
variable.

ANSWER:

The intent was that the restriction should apply to the actual
variable being used for the STAT= variable, not to the syntax.  Thus,

(1) The ALLOCATE statement is only standard-conforming if I and J are
    not equal.

(2) The ALLOCATE statement is not standard-conforming.

(3) The ALLOCATE statement is standard-conforming.

Edits to the standard are supplied to clarify this.

EDITS:

[79:40-41] Delete "The ... statement."
[80:6] Append to paragraph

TITLE: TARGET attribute and structure components
KEYWORDS: TARGET, POINTER
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

QUESTION:

The standard says ([110:43-44]), of R737 <pointer-assignment-stmt>,
  "Constraint: The <variable> shall have the TARGET attribute or be a
               subobject of an object with the TARGET attribute, or
               it shall have the POINTER attribute."

It also says ([75:22-23]), of structure components
  "A structure component has the ... TARGET ... attribute if the
   parent object has the attribute."

The <<parent object>> is defined ([75:16]) as
   "the data object whose name is the leftmost part name".

Consider:
  TYPE t
    REAL x
  END TYPE
  TYPE(t),POINTER :: p
  REAL,POINTER :: q
  ALLOCATE(p)
  q => p%x

Q1. Is this standard-conforming?

If the answer to Q1 is Yes, this still appears to leave unspecified
the case of A%B%C where A does not have the TARGET attribute and B
has the POINTER attribute.  The parent object of A%B%C is just A, and
A does not have the TARGET attribute.

Therefore the conclusion is that A%B%C does not have the TARGET
attribute.

Note: Although the standard says that "Allocation of a pointer
creates an object that implicitly has the TARGET attribute"
[81:47-48], is it not entirely sure that this shows that A%B%C has
the attribute for two reasons:

(1) Allocation is not the only way of establishing pointer
    associations.
(2) According to the quoted text, whether A%B refers to an object
    with the TARGET attribute is immaterial; the only question is
    whether A itself has the TARGET attribute.

Q2. Does this A%B%C have the TARGET attribute?

Note: the following example may be relevant:

  TYPE t
    TYPE(t2),POINTER :: p
  END TYPE
  TYPE t2
    REAL x
  END TYPE
  TYPE(t) v
  TYPE(t2),POINTER :: z
  REAL,POINTER :: q
  ALLOCATE(v%p)
  !
  ! (a)
  !
  z => v%p
  q => z%x
  !
  ! (b)
  !
  q => v%p%x

The pointer assignments following (a) are clearly valid: the first
assigns one pointer to another, and if the answer to Q1 is Yes, the
second one follows from that.

But the (a) statements have the same effect as the (b) statement, so
it would be inconsistent to disallow (b).

Q3. Apparently, substrings never have the INTENT, TARGET or PARAMETER
    attribute.  Is this a deliberate omission?

ANSWER:

Q1: Yes.  P points to an object with the TARGET attribute, and X is a
    subobject of this object.  Therefore, "Q => P%X" is conforming.

Q2: The standard leaves this case unspecified, but the intent is that
    any part of an object with the TARGET attribute should itself
    have the attribute.  An edit is supplied to remedy this omission
    in the standard.

Q3: No, this omission was inadvertant.  An edit is supplied to fix
    this.

EDITS:

[74:33] Append to paragraph
  "A substring has the INTENT, TARGET, or PARAMETER attribute if its
   parent has the attribute, but it never has the POINTER attribute."
{Fix omission.  Text parallels that for array elements and sections.}

[75:22] Delete ", TARGET,".

[75:23] After "." insert
  "A structure component has the TARGET attribute if the parent
   object has the attribute or if any <part-ref> except the rightmost
   has the POINTER attribute."

[110:43-44] Delete
  "be a subobject of an object with the TARGET attribute or it shall
   have".
{Now that propagation of TARGET is fixed, we don't need the weasel
 words.}

QUESTIONS:

Subclause numbers refer to 97-007r2.

The second and third sentences of subclause 4.3.1.2 are

     A processor shall provide two or more approximation methods that
     define sets of values for data of type real. Each such method has
     a representation method and is characterized by a value for a
     type parameter called the kind type parameter.

1. Does this imply that there is a one-to-one correspondence between
kind type parameter values and representation methods?

Since the second quoted sentence says "a value," not "some values,"
assume the answer to this question is "yes."

Subclause 7.1.4.2 specifies the type and kind type paramter value for
the result of an operation.

2. Is a processor allowed to use a representation method that
corresponds to a different kind type parameter value of the same type,
or no kind type parameter value, at least if neither the precision nor
exponent range of the different representation method is less than the
one specified in 7.1.4.2?

Subclause 7.1.4.1 specifies the type and kind type paramter value for
a variable.

3. Is a processor allowed to use a representation method that
corresponds to a different kind type parameter value of the same type,
or no kind type parameter value, at least if neither the precision nor
exponent range of the different representation method is less than the
one specified in 7.1.4.1?

Subclause 7.1.4.1 specifies the type and kind type parameter value
for a result of a function.

4. Is a processor allowed to use a representation method that
corresponds to a different kind type parameter value of the same type,
or no kind type parameter value, at least if neither the precision nor
exponent range of the different representation method is less than the
one specified in 7.1.4.1?

Subclause 13.14.28 specifies that the result of DBLE is the same as
the result of REAL with a KIND argument having the value KIND(0.0d0).

Subclause 13.14.88 specifies that the kind type parameter value of the
result of REAL is that specified by the KIND argument.

5. Is a processor allowed to use a representation method for the
result that corresponds to a different kind type parameter value of
the same type, or no kind type parameter value, at least if neither
the precision nor exponent range of the different representation
method is less than the one specified in 13.14.88?

ANSWER:

The answer to question 1 is yes, since each valid real kind type
parameter value characterizes a representation method for an
approximation method (4.3.1.2).

Clause 1.4 says
   'This standard does not specify ...
   (6) The physical properties of the representation of quantities and
   the method of rounding, approximating, or computing numeric values
   on a particular processor,
   ...'

The processor is therefore free to use different precision for
intermediate real calculations, which answers all the other questions.

          END

Question 4: What is the meaning of the phrase "the exact dependence
on the entities" in section 12.2.2?

ANSWER:

Answer 1. Yes
Answer 2. Yes
Answer 3. Yes
Answer 4.  The sentence containing the phrase "the exact dependence
on the entities" in section 12.2.2 is intended to convey that in
those cases where the shape or character length type parameter is not
constant, the corresponding characteristic of the function result is
not a value but the way the value is determined when the procedure is
invoked.

Discussion: Only the mapping from program state to value is
significant, not the particular form in which that mapping is
expressed.

In question 3, for example, it is a characteristic of FUN and ENT
that their lengths are twice the value of M.  It is not required that
the expressions of this mapping be identical, only that they yield
the same results.  Thus, twice the value of M could be expressed as
M+M for FUN and as M*2 for ENT.

The phrase "the exact dependence on the entities in the expression is
a characteristic" is used to give the processor the freedom to
evaluate lengths and bounds in any convenient manner.  Since the
characteristics must be the same, the phrase implies, as a minimum,
that the expressions be algebraically equivalent and use the same
variables.  In an example such as:

            FUNCTION FUN(M)
            CHARACTER (LEN=M)::FUN
            CHARACTER (LEN=M + 0*K)::ENT
            ...
            ENTRY ENT(M, K)
            ...
            END

FUN and ENT do not have the same characteristics since their
dependence on "K" is different.  Indeed, if on entry to FUN the
length of FUN or ENT were evaluated using the expression for the
length of ENT the evaluation would fail since K is not associated
with a value.

Clearly, it can be extremely difficult to determine on a static basis
whether two expressions of a mapping are consistent, and there is no
requirement in the standard that this be done.  It would be possible
to check during execution that the values expressed are identical
each time such a procedure is invoked, but it is expected that a more
typical application of this requirement would be to assume that it
has been met and use one expression of this mapping as the basis for

DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Section 12.3.2.2 indicates that an interface body specifies all of a
procedure's characteristics and that the characteristics must be
consistent with those in the procedure definition.  Are the following
code fragments standard conforming?

(a)      PROGRAM FRED
           INTERFACE
             SUBROUTINE SUB (ARR,J)
               INTEGER ARR(1:)
             END SUBROUTINE
           END INTERFACE
         INTEGER ARR(10)
         CALL SUB(ARR,2)
         END PROGRAM

         SUBROUTINE SUB(ARR, J)
           INTEGER ARR(J:)
           ...
         END SUBROUTINE SUB

(b)      FUNCTION C1( )
           CHARACTER(*) C1
           ...
         END FUNCTION C1
         FUNCTION C2(N)
           CHARACTER(N) C2
           ...
         END FUNCTION C2

         SUBROUTINE CALLER( )
           INTERFACE
             FUNCTION C1( )
               CHARACTER(*) C1
             END FUNCTION
             FUNCTION C2(N)
               CHARACTER(2) C2
             END FUNCTION
           END INTERFACE
           CHARACTER(5) CC
           CC=C1( )//C2(2)

ANSWER:

  (a)  This example is standard conforming.

  (b)  This example is not standard conforming.

Discussion:

(a) 12.2.1.1 states that the characteristics of a dummy data object
include its shape, and that if the shape is assumed then that is a
characteristic.  Section 2.4.5 states that the shape of an array is
determined by its rank and extent in each dimension (but not by its
bounds, 5.1.2.4.2).  Both the interface block for SUB and the
definition of SUB describe the shape of ARR as assumed, so they are
describing the same shape, and the program is standard conforming.

(b) Section 12.2.2 states that the characteristics of a function
include whether or not the function result value is a character of
assumed length.  So the interface body for function C1 must indicate
that C1 is of assumed length. However, item (3) in 5.1.1.5 indicates
that scoping units that invoke an external character function of
assumed length must have access to a declaration of the function name
with a length type parameter value other than *. This is explained in
Note 5.6, (which has been removed in Fortran 2003).

In addition, the interface for C2 does not conform to the standard as
the length of C2 specified as 2 is not consistent with the length
specified as N within the function definition.

KEYWORDS: declaration, specification
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:  "Declaration" is a significant concept of Fortran 90.

Section 5 is titled "Data object declarations and specifications" and
what were in FORTRAN 77 "type statements" are now "type declaration
statements".  5.1.1 states

    "A type specifier specifies the type of all entities declared in
     an entity declaration list."

Nowhere, though, is there a definition of "declaration".

What does it mean, in Fortran 90, to "declare" something?

ANSWER:

That is correct, the standard does not define the term "declaration".
It is used both in the sense of explicit specification, and of
implicit declaration via usage or context.  Both of these meanings
fall within the normal English meaning of the term.

The suggestion that the standard should define the term "declaration"
may be considered for a future revision of the standard.

TITLE: TARGET attribute for a derived-type object with a pointer
       component
KEYWORDS: POINTER attribute, TARGET attribute, structure, structure
          component
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Section 6.1.2 (page 63) states:

   "A structure component has the INTENT, TARGET, or PARAMETER
    attribute if the parent object has the attribute."

A constraint following R505 (page 40) states:

   "Constraint: If the POINTER attribute is specified, the TARGET,
    INTENT, EXTERNAL, or INTRINSIC attribute must not be specified."

This would seem to imply that a derived-type object with a pointer
component could not have the TARGET attribute. Though it is
informative, Annex C.4.6 (page 267) contains the following example:

       "TYPE CELL
                INTEGER :: VAL
                TYPE (CELL), POINTER :: NEXT_CELL
        END TYPE CELL
        TYPE (CELL), TARGET :: HEAD
        TYPE (CELL), POINTER :: CURRENT
        ...
        CURRENT => HEAD"

which allows the static head of a linked list or tree.  Does the
structure component HEAD % NEXT_CELL contradict the text cited above
from section 6.1.2 or the cited constraint following R505?

ANSWER:

No, the component reference does not contradict either the constraint
or the cited text from 6.1.2.  The cited text from 6.1.2 has been
clarified by F95 interpretation 000100.

Discussion: The constraints that follow a syntax rule, or a set of
syntax rules, are syntactic constraints and apply only to the syntax
rules they immediately follow.  Thus, the constraints that follow
rules R501 through R505 at the beginning of section 5 apply only to
those rules.  This means they apply only to type declaration
statements.  Since a derived type component is part of a derived type
definition (which is not a type declaration statement), the
constraints do not apply to derived type components.  The rule that
prevents an entity from having conflicting attributes when applied by
multiple specification statements is found in 5.2:

  "The combination of attributes that may be specified for a
   particular entity is subject to the same restrictions as for type
   declaration statements regardless of the method of specification."

TITLE: Expressions in <type-spec> of a FUNCTION statement
KEYWORDS: expression - specification, expression - initialization,
          FUNCTION statement, host association, use association
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

The syntax rule R1217 shows that the type and type parameters of a
function can be specified in the FUNCTION statement (12.5.2.2).

(a) If a <type-spec> appears in a FUNCTION statement, can the
initialization and specification expressions of that <type-spec>
involve names of entities that are declared within the function or
are accessible there by host or use association?

(b) Section 5.1 states:

      "The <specification-expr> (7.1.6.2) of a <type-param-value>
       (5.1.1.5) or an <array-spec> (5.1.2.4) may be a nonconstant
       expression provided the specification expression is in an
       interface body (12.3.2.1) or in the specification part of a
       subprogram."

As a FUNCTION statement is not part of the specification part of a
subprogram, this text in the standard appears to distinguish between
FUNCTION statements that are in interface blocks and ones that are
not. This text seems to prohibit such examples as:

         INTEGER I
          ...
         CONTAINS
           CHARACTER*(I+1) FUNCTION F()
              ...
              COMMON // I
              ...

where it can be confusing as to which I is being referenced in the
FUNCTION statement.  While host association does not apply to
interface bodies, for consistency should the text quoted from Section
5.1 have been "... is in the specification part of an interface body
(12.3.2.1) or in the specification part of a subprogram."?

(c) Section 7.1.6.1 states:

      "If an initialization expression includes a reference to an
       inquiry function for a type parameter or an array bound of an
       object specified in the same <specification-part>, the type
       parameter or array bound must be specified in a prior
       specification of the <specification-part>."

Was this text intended to apply to FUNCTION statements even though
they are not part of any <specification-part>, thus disallowing
fragments such as:

      INTEGER (KIND=KIND(X)) FUNCTION F()
        INTEGER(KIND=KIND(0)) X
        ...

Similar text appears in Section 7.1.6.2.

ANSWER:

(a) A specification expression in the <type-spec> of a FUNCTION
statement may involve names of entities that are declared within the
function or are accessible there by host or use association, but an
initialization expression in such a <type-spec> may only involve
names that are accessible by host or use association.

(b) No.  It was not the intent of the standard to distinguish between
the two types of FUNCTION statements cited.  As elaborated in the
discussion of part (a), the standard intended to allow the
<type-spec> expression of a FUNCTION statement to be a nonconstant
expression.  The sentence cited is corrected with a supplied edit.

(c) Yes, the text cited from 7.1.6.1 was intended to apply to
FUNCTION statements.  The sentence quoted and the corresponding
sentence in 7.1.6.2 are corrected with supplied edits.  The code
fragment is not standard conforming.

Discussion:

(a) An initialization expression is a constant expression with an
additional rule relating to exponentiation (7.1.6.1).  Since it is a
constant expression, the only names it can contain are the names of
named constants, structure constructors, intrinsic procedures, and
variables whose type parameters or bounds are inquired about.

    * Named constant

      Section 5.1.2.1 states:

       "A named constant must not be referenced in any ... context
        unless it has been defined in a prior PARAMETER statement or
        type declaration statement using the PARAMETER attribute, or
        made accessible by use association or host association."

      Since the FUNCTION statement is the first statement of the
      scoping unit, there can be no prior PARAMETER statement or type
      declaration statement using the PARAMETER attribute, so the
      first clause does not apply. A named constant can appear in a
      <type-spec> of a function statement if it is accessible within
      the function by host or use association.

    * Structure constructor

      Rule R502 shows that the only opportunities for expressions to
      appear in <type-spec>s are in a <kind-selector> or in a
      <char-selector>.  However, a structure constructor can not
      appear in a <kind-selector> because rule R505 shows that a
      <kind-selector> must be an integer expression.  Similarly, R506
      shows that any initialization expression in a <char-selector>
      must be type integer.  Therefore, a structure constructor can
      not appear in an initialization expression in the <type-spec>
      of a FUNCTION statement.

    * Intrinsic procedure

      The intrinsic procedure names or classes of intrinsic
      procedures that may appear in an initialization expression are
      given in 7.1.6.1.

    * Variables whose type parameters or bounds are inquired about

      The text from section 7.1.6.1 as cited in question (c) was
      intended to apply to initialization expressions in the
      <type-spec> of a FUNCTION statement.  With the correction
      supplied, this means that if a variable appears as the argument
      to an inquiry intrinsic in the <type-spec> of a FUNCTION
      statement, the function must be a module procedure or an
      internal procedure, and the variable must exist in (be
      accessible from) the host scoping unit.

Rule R502 defines <type-spec>.  The only opportunity for a
<type-spec> to contain a <specification-expr> is when the data type
is character (<type-param-value> may be a <specification-expr>).
Section 7.1.6.2 states that a specification expression is a
restricted expression that is scalar, of type integer, and each
operation must be intrinsic.  In addition, rule (2) of 7.1.6.2 states
that a primary of a specification expression can be a dummy argument
that has neither the OPTIONAL nor INTENT(OUT) attribute.  The
following code fragment demonstrates a use of such a dummy argument:

              CHARACTER*(N+1) FUNCTION S(N)
              INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: N

Rule (2) also states that the primary can be a subobject of such a
dummy argument.  Section 6.1.2 indicates that a structure component
must not be referenced or defined before the declaration of the
parent object.  Similar rules are needed to prevent a substring from
being referenced ahead of the declaration of its parent, and an array
element or array section from being referenced ahead of the
declaration of the array.  Edits are provided to supply these rules.
Since a subobject can not be referenced before its parent object is
declared and the FUNCTION statement is the first statement of the
subprogram, the parent's declaration could not have occurred.  Thus a
subobject must not be referenced in the <type-spec> on a FUNCTION
statement for objects declared within the function.

Rule (3) states that a primary can be a variable that is in a common
block.  The following code fragment demonstrates a use of such a
common block member:

              CHARACTER*(N+1) FUNCTION S()
              ...
              COMMON N

As in rule (2), rule (3) allows a subobject of such a variable but
for the same reasons as above, such a subobject designator can not
appear in the <type-spec> expression of a FUNCTION statement.

Rule (4) states that a primary may be a variable that is accessible
by use association or host association.  The following code fragments
demonstrate uses of such variables:

              PROGRAM MAIN
              INTEGER :: N = 21
              ...
              CONTAINS
                CHARACTER(LEN = 2*N) FUNCTION SS(K)    ! N is host
                ...                                    !  associated.
                END FUNCTION
              END PROGRAM

    and

              MODULE MOD
              INTEGER K
              DATA K /20/
              END MODULE

              CHARACTER*(K*2) FUNCTION CHECK(STR)      ! K is use
                                                       !  associated.
              USE MOD
              ...
              END FUNCTION

Rule (4) also states that the primary can be a subobject of such a
use or host associated variable.

A structure constructor can not appear in a FUNCTION <type-spec>
specification expression because the expression must be of type
integer and any operations (which might yield an integer value from
one or more structure constructors) must be intrinsic.

Other rules of 7.1.6.2 state which intrinsic procedure names or
classes of intrinsic procedures may appear in a specification
expression.

Section 7.1.6.2 also states:

        A variable in a specification expression must have its type
        and type parameters, if any, specified by a previous
        declaration in the same scoping unit, or by the implicit type
        rules currently in effect for the scoping unit, or by host or
        use association.

The discussion above regarding specification expressions has already
ruled out "previous declarations" so the first clause of the cited
sentence does not apply.  The other clauses apply equally to a
FUNCTION statement <type-spec> and to type declaration statements
inside the function.

(b) When the discussion for part (a) is applied to the code fragment
provided, it means that the 'I' referenced in the <type-spec> of the
FUNCTION statement is the common block member.

There are rules in section 14.1.2.3 that determine within a scoping
unit what procedures can have the same generic specification.  These
rules directly mention access of a generic procedure via use
association, but they make no mention of generic names accessed via
host association.

There is evidence that the rules in section 14.1.2.3 were not intended
to apply to generic interfaces accessed by host association.  Section
14.1.2.4.1 indicates that a call to a generic name can be resolved to
a generic name in the host if the scoping unit and the host scoping
unit both agree that the generic name is the name of a function or a
subroutine.  This indicates that in the example above, the definition
of 'GEN2' is valid, even though 'G1' and 'G2' are functions while 'G3'
is a subroutine.  If the rules set out in 14.1.2.3 were to apply then
the definition of 'GEN2' would be invalid.

Do the rules in 14.1.2.3 apply to generic procedures accessed via host
association?

ANSWER:

Yes. [277:12-14] explains that the rules apply for all accessible
generic interfaces, including those accessible by host association.
The example program is not valid.

TITLE: Collating sequence inconsistencies
KEYWORDS: Collating sequence, ACHAR, CHAR, ICHAR
DEFECT TYPE: interpretation
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

[F95 CD 36:28+] says that "A <<collating sequence>> is a one-to-one
mapping of the characters into the nonnegative integers such that
each character corresponds to a different nonnegative integer."

QUESTION 1:

Does this definition imply that the one-to-one mapping is
dense? That is, is there a requirement that if the default CHARACTER
type has <n> characters, the corresponding collating sequence maps
to 0..<n>-1 ?

QUESTION 2:

If the answer to question 1 is NO: is it correct that the restriction
  0 <= i <= <n>-1
on argument I of the intrinsic procedure CHAR (13.14.19) is
inappropriate?

QUESTION 3:

If the answer to question 1 is NO: is it correct that the
description of the << Result Value>> of the intrinsic procedure ICHAR
(13.14.45), 0 <= ICHAR(C) <= <n>-1 is inappropriate?

QUESTION 4:

Shouldn't argument I of the intrinsic procedure ACHAR
(13.14.2) be restricted to the nonnegative integers?

ANSWERS:

(1) Yes. In the context of Fortran the character collating sequence is
    an ordered list of the characters in the character set associated
    with a list of integers denoting the position of each
    corresponding character in the ordered list of characters. The
    position number 0 is associated with the first character in the
    list. As position numbers, the list of integer values is
    necessarily dense. These position numbers are referenced in the
    descriptions of the CHAR and ICHAR intrinsic functions. The
    position numbers may be, but are not necessarily, equivalent to
    the bit patterns used to represent the associated characters in
    the computer hardware.

(2) Moot because the answer to (1) is Yes.

(3) Moot because the answer to (1) is Yes.

(4) No.  For characters that are not part of the ASCII character set,
    IACHAR  returns a processor-dependent value that need not be in
    the ASCII collating sequence.  ACHAR, being the inverse of
    IACHAR, should accept such values.

QUESTION:

Is the following observation true?

[F90 185:last sentence of 13.5.7] and [WG5/N1176, 219:22+] says ``In
particular, whereas the models are identical for w_{z-1}=0, they do
not correspond for w_{z-1}=1 and ...''

This statement assumes r==2 in the model for integer data defined in
 13.7.1, it is not true for general r. The above sentence should be
 changed to something like

``In particular, whereas the models are identical for r=2 and
  w_{z-1}=0, they do not correspond for r/=2 or w_{z-1}=1, and =
...''

ANSWER: Yes.

DISCUSSION:

The integer model in 13.7.1 describes integer values using a
signed-magnitude, base r representation. The bit model in 13.5.7
describes a method for characterizing a sequence of bits. The two
models do not generally correspond and the final sentence of 13.5.7 is
defective.

DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:
    Section 10.8.2, last sentence.  If nonadvancing output is
    followed by list-directed output, is a blank required before
    the first character written?  (I assume that if the first
    character of the current record is not a blank, list-directed
    output is not required, though possibly permitted, to replace
    that character with a blank.)

ANSWER: No.

DISCUSSION:

Following the non-advancing output operation, the location for the
start of the next output operation is within the current record.  The
list-directed output operation begins at this location. List-directed
output is an advancing output operation. Following the list-directed
output the file position is after the just-written record.

If the location for the start of the list-directed output operation is
at the beginning of the record, a blank is written to the first
location.  Otherwise, no characters are inserted between the end of
the non-advancing output and the start of the list-directed output.

QUESTION:

JP-24)
  In 8.1.4.2, second constraint below R833 states that:

  "The do-term-shared-stmt shall be identified with a label
   and all of the label-do-stmts of the shared-term-do-construct
   shall refer to the same label."

  This implies a label-do-stmts of the outer-most outer-shared-
  do-construct will permit not to refer to the same label, because
  shared-term-do-construct does not include outer-most outer-
  shared-do-construct.

  So the term "shared-term-do-construct" should be changed to
  "inner-share-do-construct and outer-shared-do-construct."

DISCUSSION:

  There is a typographical error in the question - "8.1.4.2"
  should read "8.1.4.1.2".

  The following amplification of the question was provided at the
  August 2000 WG5 meeting:

  construct:

    do 10 i=1,5     ! outer

TITLE: Generic type-bound procedures

DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Section 12.4.5 discusses how a <binding-name>
in a <procedure-designator> (R1219) is resolved if the <binding-name>
is that of a generic type-bound procedure.  This seems to imply
that it is intended to be possible to invoke a generic type-bound
procedure (which one might have guessed anyway :-)).

However, according to the bnf in 4.5.4, only a specific binding has a
<binding-name>.  The <binding-name-list> in <generic-binding> is a
list of specific binding names.  Thus the discussion of generic
<binding-name>s in 12.4.5 is moot, there being no such things.

Consequently, R1219 appears to provide no syntax for invoking
generic type-bound procedures.

Should R1219 and 12.4.5 be modified to allow a reference of the
form "<data-ref> % <generic-name>" where <generic-name> is
the name of a generic binding of the declared type of <data-ref>?

ANSWER:

No.  As is, the standard provides syntax for invoking a generic
type-bound procedure.

DISCUSSION:

There is no explicit BNF definition of <binding-name> in 4.5.4 or
elsewhere; therefore it's use in R1219 is, by our implicit BNF rules,
simply equivalent to <name> with the only constraints being those
specified for R1219.

In R1219, <binding-name> is allowed and indeed required to be a
"binding name".  This is a technical term defined in 4.5.4 (at
[57:23-26]) to mean both the <binding-name> of a specific type-
bound procedure and the <generic-name> of a generic type-bound
procedure.

Thus all of the analysis in the question is based on a false premise.

TITLE: Component value for pointer components
KEYWORDS: component, value, pointer
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

According to 4.5.7, the component value for an
allocatable component includes the bounds if the component
is allocated.  However, no mention is made of the bounds
of pointer components.  It is possible for pointers with
different bounds to be associated with the same target
(13.7.13); therefore, I conclude that the bounds are not
part of the association.

Is it standard conforming for a processor to print 1 as
a result of the following program?

  program me
    type t
      integer, pointer :: p(:)
    end type t
    type(t) :: x
    allocate(x%p(3:5))
    call sub(x)
  contains
    subroutine sub(y)
      type(t), value :: y
      write (*,*) lbound(y%p)
    end subroutine sub
  end program me

ANSWER:

No, a processor is required to print 3 as a result of the above
program.  The conclusion that the bounds are not part of a pointer's
association is incorrect.

DISCUSSION:

The analysis appears to be based on the theory that the ASSOCIATED
intrinsic function defines what is meant by "pointer association".
In fact, the 1-argument form of that function only returns the
pointer association *status*, and the 2-argument form only tests the
association between a pointer and a target - it does not compare the
pointer association of two pointers.

If the bounds were not part of "pointer association", non-component
pointers would be similarly faulty.

Pointer association is established by the ALLOCATE statement (6.3.1.2)
and pointer assignment (7.4.2.1).  Both of these specify array bounds
for the association.  These are the defining sections for pointer
association, and therefore, the bounds form part of that association.

It could be recommended that a future revision of the standard contain
a more comprehensible definition of the term "pointer association".

QUESTION:

I thought that the intent was that it would be
impossible to reference a deferred binding.  However, it
doesn't appear to me that this intent was achieved.
Consider the following program (Sorry, but I don't have
any compilers up to syntax-checking this).

  module defer

    type, abstract :: t
    contains
      procedure (sub), nopass, deferred :: deferred_proc
    end type t
    type, extends(t) :: t2
    contains
      procedure :: deferred_proc => sub2
    end type t2

  contains
    subroutine sub
      write (*,*) 'Hello.'
    end subroutine sub
    subroutine sub2
      write (*,*) 'Goodbye.'
    end subroutine sub2
  end module defer
  program p
   use defer
   class(t), pointer :: x

   nullify(x)
   call x%deferred_proc

  end program p

Is this a valid program?  If not, what restriction of the
standard does it violate?

Note that x%deferred_proc does not require the value of x (4.5.7)
and thus is not a reference to x (2.5.6).  Therefore, [83:23-24]
does not prohibit this.  Nor is it clear that there is an intent
to prohibit invocation of type-bound procedures for disassociated
pointer objects; except in the case of deferred bindings, this
seems well-defined and potentially useful.

Because x is disassociated, its dynamic type is the same
as its declared type, thus making the interpretation of
x%nondeferred_proc reasonably clear.

ANSWER:

No, this was not intended to be a valid program.
An edit is supplied to clarify this situation.

  end module undefined

  program p
    use undefined

Is this a valid program?  If not, what restriction of the

Note that x%nondeferred_proc does not require the value of x (4.5.7)
and thus is not a reference to x (2.5.6).  Therefore, [83:23-24]
does not prohibit this.

If x were disassociated, its dynamic type would be t and the
interpretation of this would be reasonably clear.

However, the standard does not appear to specify the dynamic type
of x when its association status is undefined.  Nor can I find
any prohibition that applies to this case.

ANSWER:

No, the program is not valid, because the standard does not establish
an interpretation of it.  An edit is supplied to clarify this.

Furthermore, the case with a disassociated pointer was not intended to
be valid.  An edit is supplied to correct this oversight.

DISCUSSION:

Access to object-bound procedures (a.k.a. procedure pointer
components) always require there to be an object.  Access to
type-bound procedures of an object was intended to require this too,
but the effect of the NOPASS attribute on this was overlooked.

QUESTION:

Fortran 95 allowed the following program to print "T".
Fortran 2003 does not appear to allow this.

      module m
        integer, pointer :: i_ptr
      contains
        subroutine sub(j)
          integer j
          call sub2(j)
        end subroutine
        subroutine sub2(j2)
          integer, target :: j2
          print *, associated (i_ptr, j2)
        end subroutine
      end module

      program foo
        use m
        integer, target :: i
        i_ptr => i
        call sub(i)
      end program

Fortran 95 stated, in section 12.4.1.1, on page 200:
  If the dummy argument does not have the TARGET or POINTER
  attribute, any pointers associated with the actual argument do
  not become associated with the corresponding dummy argument on
  invocation of the procedure.  If such a dummy argument is
  associated with a dummy argument with the TARGET attribute,
  whether any pointers associated with the original actual
  argument become associated with the dummy argument with the
  TARGET attribute is processor dependent.

Fortran 2003 (04-007) states, in section 12.4.1.2, on page 269:
  If the dummy argument does not have the TARGET or POINTER
  attribute, any pointers associated with the actual argument do
  not become associated with the corresponding dummy argument on
  invocation of the procedure. If such a dummy argument is
  associated with an actual argument that is a dummy argument
  with the TARGET attribute, whether any pointers associated
  with the original actual argument become associated with the
  dummy argument with the TARGET attribute is processor
  dependent.

It's clear in this example that j is not associated with i_ptr,
because it doesn't have the TARGET attribute.  The dummy argument
j2 with the TARGET attribute falls into the case described by the
second sentence quoted from Fortran 95.  It does not fall into the
case described by the second sentence quoted from Fortran 2003,
since j is not associated with an actual argument that is a dummy
argument with the TARGET attribute.  It appears that the second
sentence in Fortran 2003 gets things backwards.

Was it intended in the example above that the program should be
allowed to print "T"?

Yes.  An edit is supplied to correct this error.

QUESTION:

Consider the following code:

      type t
        integer, allocatable :: i
      end type
      type(t) :: x
      allocate(x%i)
      x = x
      print *, allocated(x%i)
      end

In the intrinsic assignment, it is unclear whether the value of
the expression on the right-hand side of the assignment should be
determined before the any part of the left-hand side becomes
defined.

Section 7.4.1.3 of Fortran 2003 states:
  The execution of the assignment shall have the same effect as
  if the evaluation of all operations in <expr> and <variable>
  occurred before any portion of <variable> is defined by the
  assignment.

In this case, there are no operations in <expr>, so this sentence
does not apply.  There doesn't appear to be anything else to
cover this situation, so it appears that in this case, <expr>
does not have to be evaluated before any part of <variable> is
defined.

If x%i becomes deallocated before the <expr> is evaluated, then
the call to the ALLOCATED intrinsic in this example would return
the value .false.  Was it intended that this program could print
"F"?

ANSWER:

No.  It was intended that the <expr> in an intrinsic assignment
must be evaluated before any part of the <variable> is defined.

TITLE: Finalization of structure constructors in specifications
KEYWORDS: finalization, structure constructor, specification
          expression
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Paragraphs 3-5 of subclause 4.5.5.2 specify when
finalization occurs for function results in executable constructs
and in specification expressions.  They also specify
when finalization occurs for structure constructors in executable
constructs.  However, structure constructors in specification
expressions do not appear to be mentioned.  The apparent
conclusion would be that structure constructors in specification
expressions are not finalized, which seems inconsistent and
contrary to the purpose of finalization.

Q1. Are structure constructors in specification expressions
finalized?  If so, when?

The phrase "before the first executable statement in a scoping
unit" is used in two places in the standard (4.5.5.2 and at
[116:8] after note 6.24) to describe the first thing executed in a
scoping unit.  This phrase has two problems.

First, not all executable statements can be executed
as single statements; the description of execution sequence is
in terms of executable constructs rather than executable
statements.  (See 2.3.4, 8.1.1.3, and 12.5.2.0).  Although
this distinction seems unlikely to lead to confusion, the
terminology seems inconsistent.

Second, and more problematic, is that the first executable
statement or construct in a scoping unit is not necessarily the
first thing executed in the scoping unit; nor is it necessarily
executed only once.  An entry statement may cause execution to
start at some other executable construct, in which case one might
wonder whether the specified actions ever happen.  A goto might
cause the construct to be executed multiple times, in which case
one might wonder whether the specified actions happen again.  I
seriously doubt that either of these represent the intent.

Q2. If an event is specified to occcur before the first executable
statement in a scoping unit, then for a single execution of that
scoping unit, may the event happen zero times, multiple times, or
after the execution of some other executable statement or
construct in the scoping unit?

ANSWER:

A1. Yes, structure constructors in specification expressions are
finalized.  Just as with function results in specification
expressions, this finalization occurs before execution of the
executable constructs in the scoping unit.  This was an accidental
omission from the standard.  Edits are supplied to correct it.

A2. No. The intent is to describe events that happen once and only
once per execution of a procedure defined by a scoping unit.
Edits are supplied to state this more precisely.

QUESTION:

There appears to be no explicit requirement that the
<variable>s in R736 and R741 be scalar.  If data-pointer-object
and proc-component ref were data-refs, then C614 would prohibit
the <variable>s from being arrays.  However, although the syntax
looks like a special case of a data-ref, nothing appears to say
that R736 and R741 actually constitute data-refs.

The standard gives no interpretation as to what the meaning
would be in the case of an array.

Even when variable is a scalar, the standard does not appear to
define what the properties (such as type and shape) of a
data-pointer-object or proc-pointer-object are in the case where
the syntax has a "%".  All we have is a syntax with no
established meaning.

Q1. Is the <variable> in R736 or R741 allowed to be an array?

Q2. Is the interpretation of the forms in R736 and R741 the
    same as that of a data-ref?

ANSWER:

A1. No.  The standard provides no interpretation of what such
    a form would mean.  Therefore, by the first sentence of
    1.5, it is not standard-conforming.  Edits are provided to
    make this prohibition more direct.

Consider the following program:

        call z%doThings
        print *, z%id
      end program

Section 12.4.1.1 of Fortran 2003 states:
  In a reference to a type-bound procedure that has a passed-object
  dummy argument (4.5.3.3), the <data-ref> of the <function-reference>
  or <call-stmt> is associated, as an actual argument, with the
  passed-object dummy argument.

This seems to be contrary to the idea of the VALUE attribute.  For
argument association where the dummy argument has the VALUE attribute,
section 12.4.1.2 of Fortran 2003 states:
  If the dummy argument has the VALUE attribute it becomes associated
  with a definable anonymous data object whose initial value is that
  of the actual argument. Subsequent changes to the value or
  definition status of the dummy argument do not affect the actual
  argument.

It looks like the passed-object dummy argument is argument associated
with the object z itself, rather than an anonymous data object whose
initial value is that of z.

What value should the above program print?

ANSWER:

This program was not intended to be standard-conforming; the VALUE
attribute is not appropriate for a passed-object dummy argument.
Edits are supplied to clarify this situation.

DISCUSSION:

As perhaps evidenced by its own name, the passed-object dummy argument
was intended to be THE object through which the type-bound procedure
was invoked.  It performs the same function as the "self" or "this"
variable of other object-oriented languages.

Section 5.1.1.2 states:

QUESTION:

Is the following program unit standard conforming?

  SUBROUTINE SUB ( RPP )
    REAL, EXTERNAL, POINTER :: RPP
    EXTERNAL :: PP
    POINTER :: PP
    PROCEDURE(REAL), POINTER :: PPP => NULL()
  END SUBROUTINE SUB

The last sentence of "5.1.2.6 EXTERNAL attribute" appears to indicate
that it is allowed:

  "A procedure that has both the EXTERNAL and POINTER attributes is a
  procedure pointer."

That the title of subclause 12.2.1.2 is "Characteristics of dummy
procedures and dummy procedure pointers" suggests that it is allowed.
That subclause continues "... whether it is a pointer, ..." so it was
clearly envisioned that at least dummy procedures could have the
POINTER attribute.

C1216 [264:30] appears to require PPP to be allowed:

"C1216 (R1214) If => appears in <proc-decl>, the procedure entity
       shall have the pointer attribute."

On the other hand, A conspiracy of C512 [72:28-29]

"C512 (R501) If the POINTER attribute is specified, the ALLOCATABLE,
      TARGET, EXTERNAL, or INTRINSIC attribute shall not be
      specified."

the second sentence of subclause 5.1.2.6 [80:38-40]

  "This [EXTERNAL] attribute may also be specified by ... a
  <procedure-declaration-stmt>..."

the first paragraph of subclause 5.2 [85:15ff]

  "The combination of attributes that may be specified for a
   particular entity is subject to the same restrictions ...
   regardless of the method of specification.  This also applies to
   the PROCEDURE, EXTERNAL and INTRINSIC statements."

and the last sentence of the first paragraph of 12.3.2.3 [264:8]

  "It [the procedure declaration statement] specifies the EXTERNAL
  attribute...."

appears to completely wipe out procedure pointers (PPP because of the
first paragraph of 12.3.2.3).

C521 [73:6-7] and C568 [91:5] also appear to prohibit RPP and PP:

"C521 (R504) The <function-name> shall be the name of an external
      function, a function dummy procedure{, or a statement
      function}."

"C568 (R541) A <proc-entity-name> shall also be declared in a
      <procedure-declaration-stmt>."

But then the first paragraph after R1210 (defining the EXTERNAL
statement) [264:1] appears to allow RPP and PP:

  "Each <external-name> shall be the name of ... a procedure
   pointer...."

There is also a problem with protected procedure pointers.  C535
clearly envisions their existence:

"C535 (R501) The PROTECTED attribute is permitted only for a procedure
      pointer...."

while C536 prohibits their existence:

"C536 (R501) If the PROTECTED attribute is specified, the EXTERNAL ...
      attribute shall not be specified."

ANSWER:

The discussion of procedure pointers is indeed inconsistent.

The program unit is intended to be standard conforming.  It was an
oversight during the development of the procedure pointer facility
that the EXTERNAL attribute was not removed from C512, that
"procedure pointer" was not added to C521, that C535 and C536
contradict one another, and that an external statement and specifying
the EXTERNAL attribute in a type declaration statement were not
allowed in C568.  It is not helpful that the last sentence of the
first paragraph of subclause 5.2 refers to "PROCEDURE ... statements"
(which could be confused with the PROCEDURE statement in an interface
block) where it should refer to "procedure declaration ...
statements."

EDITS:

Delete ", EXTERNAL" from C512 [72:28].

Insert ", a procedure pointer" after "dummy procedure" in C521 [73:7].

"C536 (R501) If the PROTECTED attribute is specified, the INTRINSIC or

      and EXTERNAL attributes are specified, the POINTER attribute
      shall also be specified."

Replace the last sentence of the first paragraph of subclause 5.2
[86:1] by "This also applies to procedure declaration statements, and
to EXTERNAL and INTRINSIC statements."

Replace C568 [91:5]:

TITLE: VALUE attribute for polymorphic dummy arguments

DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

The VALUE attribute is not allowed for any dummy argument that has a
(visible) nonconstant length type parameter.  (Or indeed for any
array.) The intent appears to be to restrict VALUE arguments to being
of constant size.

However consider:

   SUBROUTINE S(x)
     CLASS(t),VALUE :: x
     ...

There is no requirement that X not be polymorphic, so this requires
copying a variable (known only at runtime) sized value, in violation
of the apparent intent of the other restrictions.  For example, X
might have an invisible nonconstant length type parameter in its
dynamic type; this allows the user to bypass that particular VALUE
restriction simply by obfuscating his code so that the nonconstant
length type parameter is in the dynamic type but not in the declared
type.

Should there be a restriction that a VALUE dummy argument not be
polymorphic?

ANSWER:

Yes, this restriction was accidentally omitted.
An edit is provided to fix this oversight.

DISCUSSION:

The deduced intent is apparent from the rejection of the UK comment C7
on the FCD ballot.
       WG5 agreed that the existing constraint was inconsistent, but
       felt that there were potential implementation concerns with
       deleting it completely.  Therefore, the constraint was
       instead modified to a simpler and more consistent form.

TITLE: Automatic arrays in interface bodies

STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Is the following program standard-conforming.

  program main
    interface
      subroutine sub(n)
        integer, intent(in) :: n
        real :: x(n)
      end subroutine sub
    end interface
    call sub(2)
  end program main
  subroutine sub(n)
    integer, intent(in) :: n
    real :: x(n)
    write (*,*) size(x)
  end subroutine sub

The potential problem is the declaration of X in the
interface body.

According to C542

  "An explicit-shape array whose bounds are not initialization
  expressions shall be a dummy argument, a function result, or an
  automatic array of a procedure."

The definition of an automatic array is

  "An automatic array is an explicit-shape array that is declared in a
  subprogram, is not a dummy argument, and has bounds that are not
  initialization expressions."

Although the X in subroutine sub fits this definition, the X in the
interface body does not because an interface body is not a subprogram.

In 12.3.2.1, at [259:36-37], we have

  "The specification part of an interface body may specify attributes
  or define values for data entities that do not determine
  characteristics of the procedure.  Such specifications have no
  effect."

The presumed reason for this is to allow the specification part of a
procedure to be copied into an interface body.  If the declarations of
automatic arrays cannot be so copied, that would appear to negate the
reason for the feature.

Yes.  This was intended to be standard conforming. Edits are provided

        integer, pointer :: first_ptr
        integer, pointer :: second_ptr
        integer, target  :: tgt

        end associate
      end

Section 16.4.1.5 (Construct association) indicates that the
associating entity aname is associated with the target of first_ptr.
However, section 8.1.4.3 (Attributes of associate names) indicates
that aname does not have the TARGET attribute, since this would only
be true if the selector had the TARGET attribute.

QUESTION 1:

Does the following program unit conform to the 2003 standard?

      real, intent(in) :: B
    end function MyAdd
  end module M

QUESTION 3:

If the interface block and type definition are exchanged in QUESTION
2, does the program unit conform to the 2003 standard?

ANALYSIS:

The OPERATOR(+) bindings to the types T and X construct a single
generic OPERATOR(+) interface that is a local entity of module M.
They do not construct separate OPERATOR(+) generic interfaces that
are separate local entities of the types.

16.2.3 (Restrictions on generic declarations) specifies that it
"contains the rules that shall be satisfied by every pair of specific
procedures that have the same generic identifier within a scoping
unit."

It is clear that if different functions with identical interfaces
were bound to the types that they would be a "pair of specific
procedures" and the resulting OPERATOR(+) interface would therefore
be prohibited by 16.2.3.

It is not clear whether the generic bindings bind separate specific
procedures to the OPERATOR(+) generic, or only redundantly bind the
same procedure.  If the former, the program units are not standard
conforming because they violate the provisions of 16.2.3.  If the
latter, they appear to be standard conforming.

C1209 (in 12.3.2.1) prohibits a procedure to be bound to a generic
interface more than once in a scoping unit, but only by way of a
PROCEDURE statement in a generic interface block.  There is nothing
obviously equivalent in 4.5.4, nor anything that specifies that C1209
applies to generic bindings to types.  It also does not apply between
a generic interface block and a generic interface previously
specified by a generic binding to a type (question 3), since the
latter specific binding is accomplished by a conspiracy of a
<proc-binding-stmt> and a <generic- binding>, not by a
<procedure-stmt>.

ANSWER:

The program units conform to the 2003 standard.  Multiple bindings of
the same procedure to a generic identifier using a <generic-binding>
in a type definition or by a type definition and a generic interface
block do not bind a "pair of specific procedures" to the generic
interface. Indeed, the following type definition is legal:

  type Z
  contains
    procedure :: MyAdd
    generic :: operator(+) => myAdd, operator(+) => myAdd
  end type Z

QUESTION 1:

Does the following program conform to the 2003 standard?

  program P
    interface X
      subroutine S ( A )
        integer :: A
      end subroutine S
      procedure S
    end interface X
  end program P

ANALYSIS:

16.2.3 (Restrictions on generic declarations) specifies that it
"contains the rules that shall be satisfied by every pair of specific
procedures that have the same generic identifier within a scoping
unit."

It is not clear whether the interface body and the procedure
statement bind separate specific procedures to the generic
identifier, or only redundantly bind the same procedure.  If the
former, the program is not standard conforming because it violates
the provisions of 16.2.3.  If the latter, it appears to be standard
conforming.

C1209 (in 12.3.2.1) prohibits a procedure to be bound to a generic
interface more than once in a scoping unit, but only by way of a
PROCEDURE statement in a generic interface block.

There is a general rule that nothing shall be declared more than
once. It appears that a procedure statement within an interface block
is not a declaration:  5.1.2.6 (External attribute) specifies that
the external attribute may be specified by an EXTERNAL statement, a
<procedure- declaration-stmt> or an interface body that is not in an
abstract interface block.  A procedure statement in an interface
block apparently does not specify the external attribute.  The
procedure specified by the PROCEDURE statement in the above example
is clearly an external procedure with an explicit interface, so it
satisfies the requirements of C1207.

ANSWER:

The program conforms to the 2003 standard.  Multiple bindings of the
same procedure to a generic identifier using an interface body and a
procedure statement do not bind a "pair of specific procedures" to
the generic interface.

Enforcing C1209 is more bother for processors than simply allowing
multiple bindings of a particular specific procedure to a generic
interface.  It is unhelpful to users, and can be hurtful if the
multiple bindings are specified by independent generic interfaces and
brought into a scoping unit by use association from different
modules.  There was no equivalent constraint in Fortran 90, although
something like it was added by interp F90/000007.  The constraint
added there applied only to a single specification part.  It's not
clear whether that meant "declared in the same specification part" or
"accessible in the same specification part."  When it was put into
Fortran 95, it clearly applied to all accessible generic interfaces
with a particular <generic-spec>.  Given the multitude of new ways to
bring specific procedures into a generic interface in Fortran 2003,
and that many of those ways allow a specific procedure to be bound to
a generic identifier more than once, this conspicuously lonely
constraint should be removed.  Edits are supplied to correct this
oversight.

TITLE: Kinds of intrinsic type parameters
KEYWORDS: type parameter, kind, intrinsic type
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Q1. What are the kinds of the type parameters for intrinsic types?

    In most contexts, it doesn't matter. Fortran 95 did not even
    have the concept of the kind of a type parameter or a context
    in which such a thing could be detected in a
    standard-conforming program.  Fortran 2003 added the concept
    in support of derived types. It also added a syntax which
    exposes the question for intrinsic types.

Q2. What is the KIND of a type parameter inquiry?

Q3. For example, consider the program

      program what_kind
        character c
        write (*,*) kind(c%kind) == kind(0)
        write (*,*) kind(c%len) == kind(0)
      end

    Are both write statements guaranteed to print .true. (meaning
    that the c%kind and c%len are of default kind) or not?

For KIND parameters, although I can't find it explicitly stated,
I see fairly strong evidence that all intrinsic kind parameters
are intended to be default integers.  This evidence is in the
intrinsic functions.  The KIND intrinsic function and all the
selected_*_kind functions are specified to return default
integers, which would make for some strangeness if the kind
parameters were not default integer, in particular if the KIND
intrinsic could not return the kind of its argument because that
kind could not be represented in a default integer.

There also seems no obvious benefit to having the kind of the
intrinsic kind parameters be anything other than default. In
practice, the number of supported values for kind is small and
would have no trouble being represented in a default integer;
large arrays of kind values are rare, so there isn't much
benefit in using representations smaller than default.

For character length, I see no similar evidence.  Indeed, the
LEN intrinsic seems to suggest that lengths might be other than
default integer. I believe that there was clear intent to
facilitate (but not require) support for character lengths
longer than could be expressed by a default integer.

In most contexts, it doesn't directly matter what the kind of
length is.  Parameter specifications in type-specs don't have to
match in kind. So the user could specify and do arithmetic on
lengths using whatever kind was appropriate for the anticipated
problem sizes. The limit on maximum character length is
processor-dependent anyway and is not necessarily the same
as HUGE(whatever) (though it is a bit hard to imagine how it
could usefully be larger).

The only context in which I can see that might matter is in a
type parameter inquiry (6.1.3).  We don't appear to have defined
the kind of a type parameter inquiry.  Although we didn't say, I
am assuming that a type parameter inquiry ought to "return" the
kind of the type parameter it is inquiring about. Otherwise,
there would be no way to inquire about the type parameter values
of some derived type variables (if the values didn't fit in a
default integer).  We probably ought to explicitly say, though.

ANSWER:

Q1. The kind parameters of all the intrinsic types are of
    default integer kind. The kind parameter of the intrinsic
    character length parameter is processor-dependent.

    The support for this answer is as described in the question.
    Edits are provided to make this answer explicit.

Q2. The kind parameter of a type inquiry is the same as that of
    the type parameter inquired about. See page 123, lines 35-36.

Q3. The first write statement is guaranteed to print a .true. value;
    it is processor dependent whether the second one prints a .true.
    or .false. value.

DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Is it allowed for a processor to have one or more real kinds for which
there is no IEEE support, while also having real kinds for which there
is IEEE support?

Much of the IEEE material appears to assume that a processor could
simultaneously support both IEEE and non-IEEE kinds.  I thought this
was the intent.  However, the first sentence of the second paragraph
in section 14 says that if IEEE_EXCEPTIONS or IEEE_ARITHMETIC is
accessible in a scoping unit, then IEEE_OVERFLOW and
IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO are supported in the scoping unit for *ALL*
[emphasis mine] kinds of real and complex data.  This says to me
that if there is any kind of real for which the processor cannot
support IEEE_OVERFLOW or IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO, then pretty much none
of the IEEE stuff can be used on that processor at all; there
isn't much of the IEEE stuff that can be used without IEEE_ARITHMETIC
or IEEE_EXCEPTIONS.  This seems draconian and unintended.

I speculate that this condition is intended to apply to all IEEE
real kinds rather than to all real kinds.

ANSWER:

Yes, this is allowed.

The requirement that IEEE_OVERFLOW and IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO be
supported for all kinds of real and complex data within that
scoping unit was intentional.

Support of these two flags means that the exceptions can be detected,
either by a subsequent use of IEEE_GET_FLAG or by program termination
(this is not under program control unless IEEE_SUPPORT_HALTING is true
for those flags).

Whether the flags are supported outside of a routine which uses
IEEE_EXCEPTIONS or IEEE_ARITHMETIC is processor dependent.

None.

We currently say that one can deallocate an array pointer if it

What exactly does "whole" mean in this rule?

Specifically, is the following allowed:

REAL, DIMENSION(:), POINTER :: a, b
ALLOCATE(a(1:10))
b=>a(1:10)
DEALLOCATE(b)

ANSWER:

Yes, this is allowed, since "whole" means that b is
ASSOCIATED with all elements of an array that was ALLOCATEd.
In the given example, ASSOCIATED(a,b) is .TRUE., therefore either
a or b can be used to DEALLOCATE the memory.

          CLASS DEFAULT
            PRINT *, 'Class is not base'
        END SELECT

      END

Constraint C401 seems to prohibit the abstract type "base" from
appearing in a CLASS IS type guard statement, thus prohibiting this
program.  There seems to be no reason to prohibit this, and allowing
it seems to be useful in some situations.

STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

      PROGRAM foo

        CLASS(*), POINTER :: x
        INTEGER, TARGET :: i

        x => i
        SELECT TYPE (x)
          CLASS IS (INTEGER)
            PRINT *, 'How can INTEGER be a class?'
        END SELECT

      END

The description of a CLASS IS type guard statement refers to an
extension of the type specified.  This makes no sense for
nonextensible types.  C815 disallows all nonextensible derived types,
but nothing disallows intrinsic types, which are also nonextensible.

STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

      PROGRAM foo
        CHARACTER, TARGET :: c
        CLASS(*), POINTER :: p

        p => c
        SELECT TYPE (p)
          TYPE IS (CHARACTER(*))
            PRINT *, 'Character of length ', LEN(p)
        END SELECT
      END

Constraint C814 says that, in a type guard statement, the <type-spec>
shall specify that each length type parameter is assumed.

Constraint C416 does not list a type guard statement as a context in
which "*" can be used as a length type parameter for a character.

TITLE: Commas in complex namelist output
KEYWORDS: Namelist, complex formatting, comma, semicolon
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

The 7th paragraph in 10.9.2 for list directed output says:

"Complex constants are enclosed in parentheses with a
separator between the real and imaginary parts, each
produced as defined above for real constants. The separator
is a comma if the decimal edit mode is POINT; it is a
semicolon if the decimal edit mode is COMMA."

There are similar words in most other places where complex
formatting is described.

The second paragraph of 10.10.1.3 Namelist group object list
items says:

"When the next effective item is of type complex, the input
form of the input value consists of a left parenthesis
followed by an ordered pair of numeric input fields
separated by a comma and followed by a right parenthesis. "

Other places correctly describe namelist complex output as
having a separator, either a comma or a semicolon, depending
on the decimal edit mode.

Should the namelist version be reworded to say "comma or
semicolon"?


ANSWER:

Yes.  Edits are supplied to correct this oversight.

[244:29] Replace "comma" with "separator".
[244:30] Before "The first", add the following sentence:
           The separator is a comma if the decimal edit mode is POINT;
           it is a semicolon if the decimal edit mode is COMMA.
[244:32] Replace "comma" with "separator".

TITLE: Negative zero and intrinsic functions
KEYWORDS: Negative zero, IEEE, intrinsic functions
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

4.4.2 states
  "Processors that distinguish between positive and negative zeros
   shall treat them as equivalent ... as actual arguments to intrinsic
   procedures other than those for which it is explicitly specified
   that negative zero is distinguished"

Q1. Does this mean that TRANSFER(-0.0,42) is required to give the same
    answer as TRANSFER(+0.0,42)?  The definition of TRANSFER has no
    explicit mention of negative zero.

Q2. Does this mean that MERGE(+0.0,-0.0,flag) always returns +0.0?

Q3. Does this mean that SPREAD(-0.0,2) has the value [+0.0,+0.0]
    instead of [-0.0,-0.0]?

Q4. Does this mean that RESHAPE([-0.0],[1]) has the value [+0.0]
    instead of [-0.0]?

Q5. Does this mean that SET_EXPONENT(-0.0,10) is +0.0 not -0.0?

Q6. Does this mean that if a REAL variable X has a negative zero
    value, REAL(x,...) has a positive zero value?

Q7. Does this mean that CMPLX(0,-0.0) has the value (+0.0,+0.0)
    instead of (+0.0,-0.0)?

Q8. Does this mean that if a complex variable C has a negative zero
    imaginary part, that AIMAG(C) returns +0.0 instead of -0.0?

Q9. In any other intrinsic function, if the definition of the
    intrinsic would imply a different result for negative zero than
    for positive zero, does this mean that the function returns the
    positive zero answer for a negative zero argument?

ANSWER:

Q1.  No.  The definition of TRANSFER explicitly states that its result
     has the same physical representation as its first argument.  This
     would not be possible if "equivalent" meant that the exact same
     result had to be produced.

Q2.  No, this would contradict the definition of MERGE.

Q3.  No.  SPREAD "replicates" its argument, which means that the value
     of each copy is the same as the original, not just compare equal.
     As with TRANSFER, this would not be possible with the suggested
     interpretation of the text in 4.4.2.

Q4+.  No.  As with the previous questions, this would require an
      overly strict interpretation of the term "equivalent",
      contradicting the clear intent of the function in question.

DISCUSSION:

The term "equivalent" in the quoted text in 4.4.2 refers to the
concept of mathematical equivalence, not physical or computational
equivalence.  A clarifying edit is supplied.

EDITS:

[38:2] Before "equivalent" insert "mathematically".
