Subject: Definition status of allocated pointer object
Date: 2021-February-17
Reference: 21-007


Discussion:
-----------

In 19.5.2.8 Relationship between association status and definition
status, we have the sentence in 21-007:

"When a pointer is allocated, it becomes associated but undefined."

But if the ALLOCATE statement that allocates the pointer has a SOURCE=
specifier, the sentence in 19.5.2.8 seems incorrect. An edit is
provided to account for the SORUCE= case.


Edits to 21-007
----------------

[527:4] Change sentence 4 in 19.5.2.8 Relationship between association
status and definition status:

"When a pointer is allocated, it becomes associated but undefined."

to

"When a pointer is allocated, it becomes associated but, unless the
SOURCE= specifier is used, its definition status will be that of an
uninitialized variable."
