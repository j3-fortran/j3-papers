	To: X3J3						   
	From: JOR (R. Bleikamp)
	Subject: Edits for derived type I/O
	Date: Feb. 18, 1998
	
	Edits are based on the functional description in paper 97-217r1.

	Changes since 98-134 are marked with "|" in the left margin.
	
	The text strings <i> and </i> delimit text to be italicized.
	Many quoted names (i.e. "w", "d") are to be italicized or bold also.
	
	"*"s in the left margin are used to highlight really important concepts.
	
	Two minor functional changes from 97-217r1.  The processor no longer resets
	the state of BN/BZ/SP/SS/P to the unit default.  They are still pushed/popped
	around the call to the user defined derived type I/O routine.  Second,
	these routines are now callable by the user (it was too hard to avoid).
	
	Edits are based on 98-007 (Jan 13, 1998).
	
	Section 9.2.2.1 [143:38], list item (7),
	    change "data transfer" to
	    "data transfer, except for child data transfer I/O statements (9.4.4.4.3)"
	
	Section 9.4.2 [156:11]
	Section 9.4.2 [156:17]
	Section 9.4.2 [156:20]
	
	    In all three lines, change the "." to 
	    ", except when the object is processed by a user defined derived type
	     I/O routine, as described in section 9.4.4.4.3."
	
	Section 9.4.2 [156:28]
	
	    Change the "." to 
	    ", except when the list item is processed by a user defined derived
	     type I/O routine, as described in section 9.4.4.4.3."
	
	Section 9.4.4.4.2 [161:3],
	
	    Change "objects." to
	    "objects, except when the derived type object is processed by a user
	     defined derived type I/O routine, as described in section 9.4.4.4.3."
	
	Section 9.4.4 [157:41], in the first list,
	
	    In list item (5),
	    change "(9.2.1.3.2)."
	    to "(9.2.1.3.2), except when executing a child data transfer statement
	    (9.4.4.4.3)."
	    
	Section 9.4.4 [158:1], in the first list,
	
	    In list item (8),
	    change "(9.2.1.3.3)." to
	    "(9.2.1.3.3), except when executing a child data transfer statement
	     (9.4.4.4.3)."
	
	If we decide to support ASYNC I/O in a user defined derived type
	I/O routine, then the second list in this section needs a similar edit.
	No edits for now.
	
	Add a new section, 9.4.4.4.3 [161:26+]:
	
	    "9.4.4.4.3  User Defined Derived Type I/O Routines
	
	     User defined derived type I/O routines allow a program to alter the
	     default handling of derived type objects and values in data transfer
	     I/O statements as described in section 9.4.2.
	
	     A user defined derived type I/O routine is any routine whose interface
	     matches one of the interfaces described in this section.
	     A particular user defined derived type I/O routine is selected based
	     on the direction of the data transfer (input or output), the type of
	     data transfer statement (formatted or unformatted), and the particular
	     derived type.
	
	     When an interface for a matching user defined derived type I/O
	     routine is visible in a scoping unit, and other requirements are met,
	     the processor will not process those derived types list items as
	     described in 9.4.2.  Instead, it will call the matching user defined
	     derived type I/O routine, for any data transfer I/O statements executed
	     in that scoping unit.  The user defined derived type routine
	     controls the actual data transfer operations for the derived type
	     list item.
	
	  *  An I/O statement which includes a derived type list item, that
	  *  causes a user defined derived type I/O routine to be invoked, is
	  *  called a parent data transfer I/O statement.  Any other I/O data
	  *  transfer statement executed specifying the unit passed into a
	  *  user defined derived type I/O routine while the parent data
	  *  transfer I/O statement is being processed is called a child data
	  *  transfer I/O statement.
	
	     Note: A user defined derived type I/O routine will usually contain
	     child data transfer I/O statements, that read values from,
	     or write values to, the current record.  The effect of executing the
	     user defined derived type I/O routine is similar to substituting the
	     list items from any child data transfer statements into the parent
	     data transfer I/O statement's list item list, along with similar
	     substitutions in the format specification.
	
	     Note: A particular execution of a READ, WRITE or PRINT statement can
	     be both a parent and a child data transfer I/O statement.  A user
	     defined derived type I/O routine can indirectly call itself or another
	     user defined derived type I/O routine by executing a child data
	     transfer I/O statement containing a list item of derived type,
	     where a matching interface is visible for that derived type.
	     If a user defined derived type I/O routine calls itself indirectly
	     in this manner, it must be declared RECURSIVE.
	
	  *  A child data transfer I/O statement is processed differently than
	  *  a non-child data transfer I/O statement in the following ways:
	  *    - Executing a child data transfer statement does not position
	  *      the file prior to data transfer.  
	
	  *    - An unformatted child data transfer I/O statement does not
	  *      position the file after data transfer is complete.  
	
	     For a particular derived type, there are four possible user defined
	     derived type I/O routines; one each for formatted input, formatted
	     output, unformatted input, and unformatted output.  The user need not
	     supply all four routines for a particular type.
	
	     The four allowable interfaces for user defined derived type
	     I/O routines are:
	
	          INTERFACE READ ( FORMATTED )
	            SUBROUTINE my_read_routine_formatted		&

	            END
	          END INTERFACE
	
	          INTERFACE WRITE ( FORMATTED )
	            SUBROUTINE my_write_routine_formatted		&
	                                        (unit,			&

	          END INTERFACE
	
	          INTERFACE WRITE ( UNFORMATTED )

	          END INTERFACE
		
		The actual specific routine names (the my_..._routine_...
    |		routine names above) and the dummy argument names are not significant.

    | (134r1: deleted text about these routines not being directly callable)

    |		The dummy arguments shall have the type, type parameters, and
    |		rank as described above.  No other attributes may be specified
    |		for a dummy argument, except that the "dtv" dummy
    |		argument may also be given the TARGET attribute.

		The user defined derived type I/O routines are invoked during the
		processing of I/O data transfer statements when the I/O data
	        transfer statement is processing a derived type list item and:
	
	     	  - for unformatted, list directed, and namelist i/o, a
		    matching interface for the derived type of that list item
		    is visible
	
	     	  - for I/O statements with a <format-specification>, 
	     	    a matching interface for the derived type of that list
		    item is visible, and the list item matches up with a DT
		    edit descriptor,
	
		The "unit" dummy argument will have the same unit value as
		specified by the user in the originating I/O statement
		for all external units except "*".  When an internal unit or
		the "*" external unit was specified in the originating I/O
		statement, the "unit" dummy argument will have a processor
		dependent negative value.
	
		Note: Since the "unit" dummy argument value will be negative when
		the parent I/O statement specified an internal file or "*" unit,
		a user defined derived type I/O routine should not execute an
		INQUIRE without checking for a positive value of the unit dummy
		argument.
		
		The "iotype" argument will have the value:
	
		  - "LISTDIRECTED" if the originating I/O statement specified
		     list directed I/O,
	
		  - "NAMELIST" if the original I/O statement contained an
		    NML= specifier, or
	
		  - "DT[letters]" if the originating I/O statement contained a
		    format specification and the list item matched up with a
		    DT edit descriptor.
		    The "DT" in "iotype" and the <i>letters</i> after the "DT"
		    will be converted to upper case.
	
		If the original I/O statement is a READ statement, a value assigned
		to the "dtv" dummy arg (or some portion thereof) by the user defined
		derived type I/O read routine will assign those values into the
		input list item.
		
		If the original I/O statement is a WRITE or PRINT, the "dtv"
		dummy arg contains the value of the list item from the
		original I/O statement.
		
		The "w", "d", and "m" arguments contain the user specified
		values from the FORMAT (i.e.  FORMAT(DT12.5.2 ) ).  If the
		user did not specify "w", "d", and/or "m", those dummy
		arguments will not be present.  They will not be present if
		the original I/O statement was a list directed, or namelist
		I/O statement.
		
		The user defined derived type I/O routines for reads shall
		assign a value of .FALSE.  or .TRUE. to the "err", "eof", and
		"eor" dummy args.   The value assigned to these dummy arguments
		determine whether or not the corresponding condition will
		be triggered by the processor in the parent I/O statement when
		the user defined derived type I/O routine returns.
	
		If the value .TRUE. is assigned to the "err" dummy argument, 
		the "errmsg" dummy argument shall be defined also, before the
		user defined derived type I/O routine returns.
	
		When "err" is set to true, and the parent I/O statement did
		contained neither an ERR= nor an IOSTAT= specifier, the
		processor shall attempt to output the "errmsg" value and stop
		execution of the program.
		
	Note to the reader: If we add an ERRMSG= specifier to all read/write
	statements, this value would be returned thereto.
		
		When a DT edit descriptor is matched with a list item that is
		not a derived type an error will occur.
		
		When a DT edit descriptor is matched with a list item that is
		a derived type, but no matching interface for a
		user defined derived type I/O routine was visible, an error will
		occur.
	
		Note: The users routine may chose to interpret the "w" argument as a
		field width, but this is not required.  If it does, it would be
		appropriate to fill an output field with "*"s if "w" is too small.
		
		When a parent READ statement is active, I/O statements
		shall not READ from any other external unit other than the one
		passed in via the dummy arg "unit", nor perform output to any
		external unit.
		
		When a parent WRITE or PRINT statement is active, I/O statements
		shall not perform output to any other external unit other than the
		one passed in via the dummy arg "unit, nor perform input from any
		external unit.
	
		When a parent I/O statement is active, data transfer I/O
		statements that specify an internal file are permitted.
	
	     	OPEN, CLOSE, BACKSPACE, ENDFILE, and REWIND statements shall not
		be executed while a user defined derived type I/O routine
		is active.
	
		The user defined derived type I/O routines may
		use a FORMAT with a DT edit descriptor, for handling components
		of the derived type which are themselves a derived type.
		A child I/O statement that is a list directed or namelist I/O
		statement may contain a list item of derived type.
		
		Child WRITE and PRINT statements will write
		into the record started by the parent output statement,
		starting at the position in the record where the last edit descriptor
		left off.  Record boundaries may be created by output statements
		in the user defined derived type I/O routines for formatted I/O.
		A child formatted WRITE or PRINT statement will not position the file
		to the next record before the list items are processed, but it
		will end the current record when the child output statement
		completes, unless the child output statement is non-advancing.
	
		Child READ statements start reading from the postion in the current
		record where the last edit descriptor from the parent
		I/O statement left off.  Multiple records may be read from a
		formatted file.  A child formatted READ statement will position
		the file at the next record when the child READ statement completes,
		unless the child READ statement is non-advancing.
		
		Record positioning edit descriptors, such as TL and TR,
		used on "unit" by a child I/O statement, shall not cause the
		record position to be positioned before the record position at
		the time the user defined derived type I/O routine was invoked.
	
		Note: A robust user defined derived type I/O routine may wish to
		use INQUIRE to determine what BLANK=, PAD= and DELIM= are for
		an external unit.
		
		Edit descriptors which affect subsequent edit descriptors
		behavior, such as BN, SP, P, etc., are permitted in FORMATs in
		child I/O statements.  The processor will save the state of BN,
		BZ, S, SP, SS, and P before calling a user defined derived type
		I/O routine, call the user defined derived type I/O routine, and
		reset the processor's state of BN, BZ, S, SP, SS, and P to the saved
		state when the user defined derived type I/O routine returns.
	
		A child I/O statement is free to use these state changing edit
		descriptors without having any effect on the formatting of list
		items in the parent I/O list.
	
	Note to the reader: If directed rounding mode edit descriptors are added,
	these will be added to the list of "saved" states.
	
	     	READ and WRITE statements executed in a user defined derived
		type I/O routine, or executed in a routine invoked (directly
		or indirectly) from a user defined derived type I/O routine
		shall not contain an ASYNCHRONOUS="YES" specifier, nor shall
		the parent READ or WRITE statement contain an ASYNCHRONOUS="YES"
		specifier.
	
	        A user defined derived type I/O routine, and any routines invoked
		therefrom, shall not define, or cause to become undefined, any
		storage location referenced by any I/O list item, the
		corresponding format, or any specifer in any active parent input/output
		statement, except through the "dtv" dummy argument.
	
	
	In section 10.2.1 [173:1+], add
	    "or  DT [<i>letter</i>] ...  [w[.d[.m]]]  "
	
	In section 10.2.1 [173:11+] add
	    "Constraint: The string  of <i>letters</i> following a DT edit descriptor
	     shall not contain more than 253 characters."
	
	Add a new section 10.5.5 [181:28+]:
	    "10.5.5  User defined derived type editing
	
	     The DT edit descriptor allows a user provided routine to be used
	     for processing a list item of derived type instead of the processor
	     supplied I/O formatting routines.
	
	     The DT characters may be followed by up to 253 <i>letters</i>
	     (additional interspersed blanks are permitted) (ex. "DT LNK LST").
	     The text of the edit descriptor, including the initial "DT" and
	     the string of <i>letters</i>, up to but not including <i>w</i>,
	     will be converted to uppercase and have all blanks removed. 
	     The resulting character value will be passed to the user defined
	     derived type I/O routine as the "iotype" argument.
	
	     Note: The <i>letters</i> after "DT" could be used to request different
	     formatting rules for various components in the derived type.
		
	     When a derived type variable or value matchs up with a DT

	     section 9.4.4.4.3.
	
	In section 12.3.2.1, in R1207 [204:14+] add,

	  User control of derived type I/O

	  F2000 provides a portable mechanism for the implementor of opaque
	  data types to also implement the I/O conversion routines for
	  the opaque data type, in Fortran, directly accessible from Fortran's
	  READ and WRITE statements, for both formatted and unformatted I/O.
