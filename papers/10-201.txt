Date: 2010 August 13

NUMBER: F08/xxxx
TITLE:  Segment ordering rules
KEYWORDS: segment, allocation
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Was it intended to allow the allocation of a variable that is not a
subobject of a coarray to be unordered with respect to its definition
by another image through a pointer component of a coarray?

ANSWER:

No. This case has been overlooked in the segment ordering rules. An edit is
supplied to correct this.

EDIT:

[189] In 8.5.2 Segments, paragraph 3, replace the second bullet item by
    "if the allocation or the pointer association status of a variable
     is changed on an image in a segment, that variable shall not be
     referenced or defined in a segment on another image unless the
     segments are ordered, and"
