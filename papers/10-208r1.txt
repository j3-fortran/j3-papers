TITLE:  Executing a type-bound procedure on a coindexed object
KEYWORDS: coarrays, polymorphism
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

  module m
    type :: foo
      integer :: i = 0
    contains
      procedure, pass :: op
    end type
  contains
    subroutine op(this, i)
      class(foo) :: this
      this%i = i
    end subroutine
  end module m
  program p
    use m
    class(foo), allocatable :: o_foo[:]
    integer :: me
    allocate(foo :: o_foo[*])
  
    me = this_image()
    if (me == 1) then
      call o_foo[2]%op(1)             ! Type-bound call.
    end if
    sync all
    if (me == 2) write(*,*) o_foo%i
  end program p

This program is not standard-conforming, as it violates one of the
requirements of 12.5.2.4p2, viz
  "If the actual argument is a polymorphic coindexed object,
   the dummy argument shall not be polymorphic."

However, if the type-bound call were replaced by

  SELECT TYPE(o_foo)
  TYPE IS (foo)
    CALL o_foo[2]%op(1)
  END SELECT

appears to be standard-conforming.

The example program appears to be harmless, so the requirement appears
to be unnecessary.  It is conjectured that the requirement is
misworded and should instead be
  "If the actual argument is a polymorphic subobject of a coindexed
   object, the dummy argument shall not be polymorphic."?

Q1. Is this requirement intentional?

Furthermore, constraint C1229 says of a <data-ref> that is the object
for a type-bound procedure reference, that it
  "shall not be a polymorphic subobject of a coindexed object";
however, C617 already prohibits any <data-ref> from being a
polymorphic subobject of a coindexed object except as the subject of
a type parameter inquiry or as the actual argument in an intrinsic
inquiry function reference, so C1229 appears to be completely
redundant.

Q2. Is constraint C1229 redundant?

ANSWER:

A1. The requirement is intentional, and needed to avoid a potential
    type enquiry of an object on another image.  Consider

      TYPE,EXTENDS(foo) :: badfoo
        CLASS(*),ALLOCATABLE :: badcomponent(:)
      END TYPE

    If the dynamic type of object "o_foo" were "badfoo", the call to
    the type-bound procedure cannot be resolved without enquiring the
    type of o_foo%badcomponent on image 2 (because it needs to know
    how much to copy, and how); this type is not necessarily the
    same type as that of o_foo%badcomponent on image 1.

A2. Yes, constraint C1229 is redundant.  An edit is supplied to remove
    this unnecessary redundancy.

EDITS to 10-007:

[290:1] Delete C1229.
