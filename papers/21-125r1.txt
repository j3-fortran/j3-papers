Subject: Summary of Generics Tutorial

1. Introduction

This paper is intended to serve as a proxy/reference for the tutorial
given by the Generics subgroup at m223.


2. Values

At the suggestion of G. Klimowicz, Generics subgroup has had
substantive discussions regrading the of a value system to guide the
development of F202Y.  A "value system" is a short list of qualities
that help deterime the relative goodness of a set of solutions.  By
identifying what we collectively agreed is "good" we can more
objectively discuss aspects of a proposal as being "better" or "worse"
than alternatives.  The approach can be used beyond Generics subgroup,
and we encourage J3 and WG5 to consider adoption of a value system in
future meetings.

The benefits of a value system include:

  - Tractability: achieve early alignment on important properties

  - Consistency: Alternatives evaluated against common criteria

  - Communication: Rationale for decisions can be explained at a high level

Each "value" in a value system is a word or short phrase that
incapsulates a broad ideal, and ideally is indpependent from other
values.  Each value is also prioritized against other values - not all
values are of equal importance.  And finally, each value should have a
rationale.

Possible values for generics subgroup:

  - Utility: How well does a given feature solve real-world problems
    faced by Fortran pprogrammers.

  - Run-time performance: A features sohuld not negatively impact
    run-times

  - Fit: How well does a feature mesh with the existing language

  - Longevity: Consider total impacts beyond the compiler while
    leveraging lessons from other languages

  - Implementability: Can the feature be implemented without major
    compiler rewrites

  - Marketability: Does the feature help to attract/retain members of
    the target communities (scientific, engineering, ...)


3. Subgroup activities and plans

3.1.  Recent activities

The Generics subgroup has been holding ~90 minute biweekly telecons
starting just after the October 2020 meeting.  We are interesting in
including additional members of the Fortran community in these
meetings provided that the size does not grow to the point of
preventing efficient discussions.  Those interested in participating
should contact Tom Clune or any member of the Generics subgroup.

Recent topics that have beeen discussed in depth include:

   - A repeat performance of M. Haveraaen's tutorial form the Tokyo
     meeting in which he demonstrated a number of powerful results
     that can be obtained if templates are implemented in a certain
     manner.  (In particular see the discussion below regarding
     template "restrictions".)

   - Multiple discussions about how template restricitons are
     implemented in other languages.  C++ concepts, Rust traits, ...
     Subgroup consensus is that Fortran templates should support
     "strong" templates that enforce certain restrictions.  (More on
     this below.)

   - Several discussions have been had to porpose nominal syntax, just
     for the purpose af being able to discuss use cases and sketch how
     they might work in practice.  The most fully formed such syntax
     was proposed by V. Parkekh and is referred to as KART.  There
     will be a separate tutorial on KART porvided by V. Parkekh, but
     this should not be construed as an endorsement of the particular
     syntax by subgroup.

   - Preliminary collection and categorization of use cases.

3.2 Near term plans

Because of the complexity of template use cases and the somewhat
amorphous boundary of what should and should not be included in F202Y,
a heavy emphasis will be placed upon traceability.  In this manner we
can accurately gauge  consequences of adding or deleting a given
spec or requirement.

The near term priority is focus intensively on development of a
comprehensive use cases paper for templates with the goal of
submitting a draft at m224 in the summer of 2021.  The final version
of the use cases paper is expected to inclue the results of straw
votes for each use case.  These straw votes are expected to be used to
prioritize and defend formal requirement in the next phase.  In many
cases, use cases will be subdivided into smaller aspects ("micro use
cases") with separate straw votes for each.  Straw votes can be
revisited as the priorities and understanding of committee members
evolve.


We  also hope to have a very preliminary requirements document
available for review at m224.  The intent is for each requirement to
be directly traceable to one or more use cases.  The paper will be
revised after straw votes at m224, but will not be ready for voting
until m225.


It would be premature to forecast the timeline for the specs and
syntax papers with any specificity.  Much will depend upon how quickly
consensus can be achieved for the requirements.

To maintain traceability across these documents while under
development, we expect to maintain an interval version that is
separate from the formal J3 paper numbering.  (Suggestions on how to
best achieve this are welcome.)


4. Fortran Templating Facility - a sketch

4.1 Introduction

First some rough-and-ready terminology to get us on the same page.  A
"template" is a reusable entity for which precise specification is
contingent on one or more "template parameters".  Template parameters
are generally thought to be types as opposed to values, but other
entities such as operators and constant expressions may have value for
some use cases.

Templates are distinguishable from macros in that

   (a) templates are generally restricted to narrow subset of entities
       (procedure, type, ...) while macros can be used almost anywhere
       in a code
   (b) templates are processed by the compiler as opposed to macros
       which are processed by a preprocessor
   (c) most importantly, templates are "type aware" and involve more
       than mere text substitution

A "template instantiation" (or just "instantiation") is a realization
a template for a specific set of template parameters.

To speak constructively about templates it is helpful at this point to
have some sort of notation/syntax.  The syntax used in this paper is
not in any way intended to suggest syntax that would ultimately be
included in F2020Y.  Indeed, the minimal syntax here is intentionally
of the sort that would be rejected on sight if proposed for the
standard, but hopefully is suggestive enough to allow discussion of
the examples.

Lists of template parameters will be represented by a comma separated
list of 1 or more items contained within curly braces.  We will use
captialized, single character names for dummy parameters associated
with types and full words in lower case for parameters associated with
operators.  For templated procedures the parameter list will be placed
after the procedure name and before the ordinary argument list.  For
templated types the parameter list will go after the type name of the
template.

As a first example consider a templated procedure to swap two items of
the same type.  The template has one dummy parameter T and would be
written as

     SUBROUTINE SWAP{T}(x,y)    ! 1 template parameter: T
        TYPE(T), INTENT(INOUT) :: x, y
        TYPE(T) :: tmp

        tmp = x
        x = y
        y = tmp

     END SUBROUTINE SWAP

The code snippet below demonstrates instantiation of this template for
INTEGER and REAL actual parameters.

     INTEGER :: I, J
     REAL :: X, Y
     CALL swap{INTEGER}(I,J) ! INTEGER instantiation
     CALL swap{REAL}(x,y}    ! REAL instantiation

4.2  Templatable entities

The following Fortran entities are under consideration for templating:
   - modules  (ala Parameterized Modules)
   - procedures (including type-bound procedures)
   - derived types

Nominally parameterized modules obviates the need for parameterized
procedures and derived types.  However, there are practical reasons
why finer grained parameterizations may be preferred.  In particular,
the list of template parameters for parameterized module is the union
of all template parameters needed by any of the contained entities.
In practice this list can easily become long, unwieldy, and redundan
as irrelevant parameters are necessary to use any given entity from
the module.


4.3 Categories of template parameters

Subgroup is considering the following categories of Fortran entities
as allowed as values for template parameters:

   (a) type-names -  including templated type names!
   (b) operators - e.g. controlling order in a container or sort algorithm
   (c) logicals - allow for specialization of template for certain types
   (d) integers - e.g., define a template that returns the trace of a
       rank-N array
   (e) other constant expressions

There is consensus in subgroup that (a) and (b) should be supported.
Further analysis of use cases is required to see to what value
categories (c), (d), and (e) bring.

Quite possibly F202Y will intentionally limit support to a subset of
these categories with an eye toward broader inclusion in subsequent
revisions.


4.4 Representative use cases

This section briefly introduces a variety of use cases that are
representative of those that are under consideration.  The list here
is not meant to be comprehensive, but rather to stimulate thought on
the capabilities necessary to support them.


4.4.1  Generalizations of common intrinsic procedures

Many intrinsic procedures FINDLOC, only defined to work with intrinsic
types, and yet the actual algorithms involved would generally apply to
many user defined types.  For instance many users have requested to be
able to use FINDLOC on their own derived type.  The algorithm only
requires that the type support the "==" operator.

4.4.2 Generic sort

Sort algorithms can generally be applied to any type that supports a
less-than relation.

4.4.3 Generic containers

Fortran's arrays are an example of a generic container.  Arrays can be
constructed and manipulated for any type.  But there are other types
of containers that are useful in certain contexts and have been shown
to be extremely useful in many other programming languages.  The
protypical examples of other containers are: vector, set, and map.

4.4.4 Linear algebra

Many of the algorithms in linear algebra, e.g., solving a system of
linear equations, are directly relevant to any derived types that
support a narrow set of operations.  Specific examples are sparse
matrices and block-matrices.  The ideal here would be to implement
templates that work on all such conforming type but that would still
default to optimized libraries for relevant intrinsic types.



5. Restricted templates

5.1 Overview of Template Restrictions

An important feature of templates in some languages is the ability to
express specific assumptions that a template makes about the actual
values of the parameters associated with types.  In other languages
expression of thees assumptions are known as "concepts" (C++) or
"traits" (Rust).  For the discussino here, we will use the term
"restrictions", and will introduce suggesting syntax below.


If a language has no support for template restrictions, then templates
suffer some of the disadvantages associated with macros.  In
particular, compiler errors during instantiation will generally appear
as syntax errors deep inside the template definition.  The associated
error message can be quite confusing.

If instead a language does support restrictions, the compiler is able
to detect when a given instantiation fails to satisfy the restriction
and should be able to produce a much more informative message along
the lines of:

    "Template <blah> cannot be instantiated with type LOGICAL because
     it does not support the + operator."


Confusing error messages can still result though, if the implementor
of the template failed to capture all of the assumptions.  We refer to
this as support for "weak restrictions" if the language permits
omission of any necessary restrictions for a template to work.


In contrast, with strong restrictions in a language, the compiler is
required to diagnose use of any operations involving variables that
are not defined in a restriction.  With such support, a template can
be separately verified by the implementor and should "work" for any
actual template parameters that satisfy the restrictions.
M. Haveraaen's Tokyo presentation (and other papers) demonstrate a
number of very nice aspects of working with templates that work in
this fashion.

As mentioned before, Generics subgroup has a strong consensus that
Fortran should pursue support of strong restrictions for templates.


5.2 An illustrative example

We will example a simple example from the perspective of 3 langauge
scenarios: no template restrictions, weak template restrictions, and
strong template restrictions.

5.2.1 Without restrictions

Our example is a simple accumulator procedure:

     SUBROUTINE accum {T,U} (s, x)
        TYPE(T), INTENT(IN) :: s
        TYPE(U), INTENT(in) :: x

        s = s + x/2

     END SUBROUTINE accumulate


This template can only work if x/2 produces a type that can be added
with s to produce something of the same type as S Consider the
following attempts at instantiations:

     REAL :: t, dt, x
     LOGICAL :: f

     CALL accum{REAL,REAL}(t,dt)  ! WORKS
     CALL accum{LOGICAL,REAL}(f,x) ! FAILS + not impl. for LOGICAL

The failing case will generally produce a very obsure message such as

   "Incompatible data types for the + operator:
       s = s + x/2
             ^
    in template accum in file ... at line ..."

5.2.2 With weak restrictions

Consider the slightly modified template:

     SUBROUTINE accum {T,U} (s, x)
        TYPE(T), INTENT(IN) :: s
        TYPE(U), INTENT(in) :: x
        << T = T + U >>  !  Template restriction

        s = s + x/2

     END SUBROUTINE accumulate


Here we introduce a minimal notation to indicate template
restrictions: a relation enclosed by double angle brackets.
     << T = T + U >>
implies that the "+" operator acts on arguments of type T and type U
to produce type T.

Our failing instantiation from above should now produce an error
message more like:

   "Type LOGICAL does not satisfy restriction
       LOGICAL = LOGICAL + REAL
    from templace accum in file ... at line ..."

Unfortunately obscure error messages are still possible.  Consider
this attempt at instantiation:

     TYPE TimeInterval
     END TYPE

     TYPE TIME
     CONTAINS
        PROCEDURE :: ADD
        GENERIC :: OPERATOR(+) => ADD
     END TYPE

     CONTAINS

     FUNCTION ADD(t, dt) result(new_T)
       TYPE(Time) :: new_T
       TYPE(Time), INTENT(IN) :: t
       TYPE(TimeInterval), INTENT(IN) :: dt
     END FUNCTION ADD

     . . .

     CALL  accum{Time,TimeInterval} (t, dt) ! FAILS


The failure is now because the TimeInterval type does not support the
"/2" operation.  And the obscure error message would be something like:

   "Incompatible data types for the / operator
    in template accum in file ... at line ..."



5.2.4 With strong restrictions

The failure in the previous section ultimately arose because the
template definition itself did not properly capture the second
assumption about the types.  With support for strong restrictions the
compiler would be required to diagnose this while processing the
template _without_ regard to _any_ instantiations.


The error message would be something like

   " Operation / not defived for type U
        s = s + x / 2
	          ^
     at line ... in file ..."


Once an implementor has correctly specified all necessary
restricitons, the template can be verified without regard to specific
types.  Instantiations with conforming types that (with correctly
implemented operations) can then be guaranteed to "work".


The corrected template would be:

     SUBROUTINE accum {T,U} (s, x)
        TYPE(T), INTENT(IN) :: s
        TYPE(U), INTENT(in) :: x
        << T = T + U >>     !  Template restriction
	<< T = U/INTEGER >> ! template restriction

        s = s + x/2

     END SUBROUTINE accumulate

Note, in practice, a slight improvement would be to introduce an
intermediate type parameter V representing the result of x/2 leading
to the restrictions being expressed as:
        << T = T + U >>
	<< V = U/INTEGER >>
	<< T = V >>
This allows for cases where the assignment operator can convert
type V into type T.   A slight generalization that may benefit some
end users.

Once an implementor has correctly specified all necessary
restricitons, the template can be verified without regard to specific
types.  Instantiations with conforming types that (with correctly
implemented operations) can then be guaranteed to "work".


6. Some challenges ahead

The desire for generality in templating facilities clashes to varying
degrees with various legacy aspects of the Fortran language.  These
aspects will need careful consideration, and some generality may be
intentionally restricted in F202Y.  The intent of subgroup is to chart
a path that does not prohibit further generalizations in subsequent
standards.

6.1 Parameterized derived types

Are templates a generalization of PDT's?  Do they interact with PDT's?
Should PDT's become deprecated?

6.2 Type vs Type-Kind-Rank (and attributes)

It would be desirable in many cases for type parameters not to be
restricted to include kind, rank, and possibly other attributes.  For
example, in the swap template above, could the parameter T somehow be
used to encapsulate arrays?  For one possible approach to this, see
the KART tutorial by V. Parkekh.

6.3 Ambiguous operators in template restritions

Consider a template restriction such as

<< T = U + V >>

Conceptuall, the operator "+" could reference an interface that
overloads the intrinsic "+" operator, or it could be a tpe-bound
operator associated with type U.  The algorithm expressed in the
template works well either way.

Can the restriciton mechanism be implemented in such a way as to work
with either type of operator?

6.4  Duplicate instantiations

If a templated type is instantiated twice with the same actual
template parameters is it the same actual type in both?  The usual
rule in Fortran is that (with the exception of SEQUENCE types)
identical types declared in different module are different types.
However, it would very useful for developers, if identical
instantiations were considered to be the same type.
