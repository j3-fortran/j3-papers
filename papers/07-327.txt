Discussion

In the description of the INT function Result Value, Case (iv) says
"If A is a <boz-literal-constant>, it is treated as if it were an
<int-literal-constant> ...".  This is essentially meaningless as
written.  There is no syntax connection between boz and int literal
constants, and only a vague connection between their values as
specified in 13.3 Bit model.  That model does not even take into
account a common case is the high order bit set.  This defective
description was fixed as part of the BITS feature, but is back to
being defective again in the latest draft.  The words used in the REAL
description are much closer to accurate. In the absense of a bits
type, edits are provided to parallel the description from REAL.  Also,
similar words in the description of the DATA statement are replaced by
a reference to the INT intrinsic so that the rule appears in only one
place.

Edits to 07-007r3:

[110:31-33] Replace para 11 of 5.4.6 DATA statement with:

"If a <data-stmt-constant> is a <boz-literal-constant>, the
corresponding variable shall be of type integer. The
<boz-literal-constant> is treated as if it were converted to type
integer with the kind type parameter of the variable."

[386:26-28] In the Result Value description of the INT intrinsic
(13.7.87) replace Case(iv) with:

"<Case (iv):> If A is a <boz-literal-constant>, the value of the
              result is equal to the value that a variable of the same
              type and kind type parameter as the result would have if
              its value were the bit pattern specified by the
              <boz-literal-constant>. The interpretation of the value
              of the bit pattern is processor dependent."
