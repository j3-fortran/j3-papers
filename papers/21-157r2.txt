1. Introduction

This paper contains the syntax for conditional expressions and conditional
arguments.

For background, please see 18-274.
For formal specifications, please see 20-142.


2. Syntax example

Conditional expression with elseif-chaining:
    ( cond ? expr : cond2 ? expr2 : expr3 )

Recommended form for conditional arg with optionality:
    ( cond ? arg : cond2 ? arg2 : arg3 )
where the special token .NIL. means there is no argument
(this does not conflict with user operators, as this special
 token is always followed by colon or right parenthesis, and
 that cannot happen for operators).

Previous form for conditional arg with optionality:
    ( cond ? arg : cond2 ? arg2 ) ! else absent arg

Note: Section 5 below is applicable only if the previous form is chosen
      instead of the recommended form.


3. Formal Syntax

3.1 General

A <conditional-expr> is a primary (<primary>).
A <conditional-arg> is an actual argument (<actual-arg>).

In the syntax descriptions below, the separate parts are on separate lines
only for ease of reading - in the standard they would either be on one long
line, or multiple lines joined with the "smudge" BNF continuation markers.


3.2 Syntax details

<conditional-expr> ::= ( <scalar-logical-expr> ? <then-expr>
                       [ : <scalar-logical-expr> ? <elseif-expr> ]...
                       : <else-expr> )

<conditional-arg> ::= ( <scalar-logical-expr> ? <consequent-arg>
                      [ : <scalar-logical-expr> ? <consequent-arg> ]...
                      : <consequent-arg> )

<consequent-arg> ::= <actual-arg>
                  |  .NIL.


3.3 Constraints and other requirements.

Constraint: Each <expr> in a <conditional-expr> shall have the same
            declared type, kind type parameters, and rank.

Constraint: In a <conditional-arg>, each <expr> or <variable> that is a
            <consequent-arg> shall have the same declared type, kind type
            parameters, and rank.

Constraint: At least one <consequent-arg> of a <conditional-arg> shall not
            be .NIL..

Constraint: A <consequent-arg> shall not be .NIL. unless the corresponding
            dummy argument is optional.

Constraint: In a <conditional-arg> that corresponds to an INTENT(OUT) or
            INTENT(INOUT) dummy, each <consequent-arg> shall be a
            <variable>.

Constraint: If the corresponding dummy argument is allocatable, a pointer,
            or a coarray, the attributes of each <consequent-arg> shall
            satisfy the requirements of that dummy argument.

This is to eliminate the possibility of an argument mismatch error at
runtime depending on the results of the <scalar-logical-expr>s. The wording
permits a consequent argument to be a pointer, allocatable, or have corank
indepently of the other consequent arguments but not independently of the
dummy argument.

Constraint: In a reference to a generic procedure, each <consequent-arg> in
            a <conditional-arg> shall have the same corank, and if any
            <expr> in a <conditional-arg> has the allocatable or pointer
            attribute, each <expr> shall have that attribute.

This retains generic resolution at compile time.


3.4 Examples

  y = ( i>=1 .And. i<=Size(a) ? a(i) : -Huge(y) )
  x = ( Out_Of_Range(y,x) ? Ieee_Value(Ieee_Quiet_NaN,x) : y )


4. Semantics

This all follows directly from the specifications.

Evaluating a <conditional-expr> or <conditional-arg> selects an <expr> or
<consequent-arg> by evaluating each <scalar-logical-expr> in turn until one
of them is true, or there are no more. If all the <scalar-logical-expr>s
evaluate to false, the final <expr> or <consequent-arg> is selected.

The declared type, type parameters, and rank of a <conditional-arg> or
<conditional-expr> is that of the <expr>s or <actual-arg>s that it
contains.

The value of a <conditional-expr> is the value of the selected <expr>.

If evaluating a <conditional-arg> selects .NIL., there is no effective
argument associated with the dummy argument. Otherwise, the selected <expr>
or <variable> is the effective argument.

All static requirements from a dummy argument on effective arguments apply
to any <consequent-arg>, for example if coindexed objects are prohibited as
an actual argument they are also prohibited as a consequent argument.


5. Previous form syntax and semantics (changes)

This section contains the BNF, constraints, and semantic description parts
that differ from the recommended syntax.

<conditional-arg> ::= ( <scalar-logical-expr> ? <consequent-arg>
                      [ : <scalar-logical-expr> ? <consequent-arg> ]...
                      [ : <consequent-arg> ] )

Constraint: If the corresponding dummy argument is not optional, the
            final optional ": <consequent-arg>" shall appear.

Evaluating a <conditional-expr> or <conditional-arg> selects an <expr> or
<variable> by evaluating each <scalar-logical-expr> in turn until one of
them is true, or there are no more. If all the <scalar-logical-expr>s
evaluate to false, and the last <expr> or <variable> is immediately
preceded by a colon, that <expr> or <variable> is selected.

If evaluating a <conditional-arg> selects no <expr> or <variable>, there is
no effective argument associated with the dummy argument.  Otherwise, the
selected <expr> or <variable> is the effective argument.
