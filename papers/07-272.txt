F03/0048   Control edit descriptors in UDDTIO

  Dick Hendrickson's YES on F03/0048:

    I agree with Bill Long's suggested addition to clause 10
    Add this paragraph at [236:2+]:

      "The left tab limit for a child data transfer statement is the
       file position of the parent data transfer statement at the time
       that the user-defined derived-type input/output procedure was
       invoked."

    on the grounds that the stuff related to Tx edit descriptors really
    belongs in 10.7.1.1.

  Bill Long's YES comment on F03/0048:

    In looking at the test resulting from the edits, it seems like it
    would be better to delete paragraph [202:36-203:2] and instead
    add this paragraph at [236:2+]:

      "The left tab limit for a child data transfer statement is the
       file position of the parent data transfer statement at the time
       that the user-defined derived-type input/output procedure was
       invoked."

    on the grounds that the stuff related to Tx edit descriptors
    really belongs in 10.7.1.1.

    Given that the concept of left tab limit already includes most of
    what is in the paragraph at [202:32-34], one might consider
    deleting that paragraph as redundant.

  Conclusion on F03/0048:  Has not yet passed J3 letter ballot #13 -
                           /interp will consider the above comment
                           from Bill Long at meeting #181

F03/0049   Separators in list-directed output involving UDDTIO

  Dick Hendrickson's YES comment on F03/0049:

    I agree with Bill Long's comment

      In the edit, "list directed" should be hyphenated, and we have
      changed "I/O" to "input/output" elsewhere in the standard, so
      should here as well.

  Bill Long's YES comment on F03/0049:

    In the edit, "list directed" should be hyphenated, and, I believe,
    we have changed "I/O" to "input/output" elsewhere in the standard,
    so should here as well.

  Conclusion on F03/0049:  Passed J3 letter ballot #13 with the above

F03/0050   Questions about internal files

  Dick Hendrickson's YES comment on F03/0050:

    I agree with Van et. al.'s comments

  Michael Ingrassia's YES comment on F03/0050:

    with Van's changes

  Shivaram Kokrady's YES comment on F03/0050:

   with Van's changes

  Bill Long's YES comment for F03/0050:

    Concurring with Van, in the edit, "specified" -> "specifies", and
    "internal unit" -> "internal file".

  Jeanne Martin's YES comment on F03/0050:

    Yes, with Van's changes.

  Toon Moene's YES comment on F03/0050:

    I agree with Van's comment.

  Dan Nagle's YES comment on F03/0050:

    With the comment Van made, namely

      In both paragraphs of the proposed edits, "specified" should be
      "specifies" and "internal unit" should be "internal file".

  Craig Rasmussen's YES comment on F03/0050:

    Yes, with Van's changes.

  Van Snyder's YES comment on F03/0050:

    In both paragraphs of the proposed edits, "specified" should be
    "specifies" and "internal unit" should be "internal file".

  Stan Whitlock's YES comment on F03/0050:

    I agree with Van's vote:  In both paragraphs of the proposed
    edits, "specified" should be "specifies" and "internal unit"
    should be "internal file".

  Malcolm Cohen's comment on F03/0050:

    Furthermore, "referenced or defined" should be "referenced,
    defined, or become undefined".  And the last paragraph should
    have "or become undefined" after "defined".

  Conclusion on F03/0050:  Passed J3 letter ballot #13 with the above
                           change in Van Snyder's ballot and Malcolm
                           Cohen's comment.

F03/0051   Repeat specifiers and UDDTIO

  Jim Xia's NO vote on F03/0051:

    While I agree with the spirit of the interp, the edit seems to
    have a problem.  Consider the text in the edit marked between
    *** below:

      "When the first value of an <r*c> constant is transferred to a
       list item by a list-directed input statement, that input
       statement shall transfer all <r> values of that <r*c> constant
       ***to list items*** before causing any child input statement
       to be invoked.  If that list-directed input statement is itself
       a child input statement, it shall transfer all <r> values of
       that <r*c> constant ***to list items*** before terminating."

    There may not be enough list items to transfer all <r> values to.
    I think the input statement should transfer as many (up to <r>)
    values as are available list items and then ignore (throw away)
    the rest.

    For example, for the program in the interp document:
    The first child input statement encounters 2*3. It will transfer
    a number 3 to dtv%i. There are no more list items to transfer the
    second 3 to, so I believe it should skip the second number 3.

    Here is another example, this time with the parent statement:

      PROGRAM foo
        USE m
        TYPE(t) :: a
        INTEGER :: i
        OPEN(10, FILE='file.txt', ACCESS='stream', FORM='formatted')
        WRITE(10, '(A)') '2*3 5 6'
        REWIND(10)

        READ(10, *) i, a           !<-- parent READ encounters 2*3
        PRINT *, i, a%i, a%j, ipos
      END PROGRAM

    The parent statement is the first statement to encounter 2*3. It
    transfers 3 to i, but cannot transfer the second <c> constant to
    a list item.  At the beginning of the user-defined procedure, the
    file should be positioned just before the number 5 (i.e. the rest
    of the 2*3 is ignored).  Otherwise, the problem with file
    position reappears.

  Conclusion on F03/0051:  Has not yet passed J3 letter ballot #13 -
                           /interp will consider the above comment
                           from Jim Xia at meeting #181

F03/0086   Elemental and BIND(C)

  Dick Hendrickson's YES comment on F03/0086:

    I agree with Bill Long's comment:

      ELEMENTAL is not an "attribute" in the sense that we use that
      term in the standard.  Maybe something like "ELEMENTAL shall not
      be specified for a procedure with the BIND attribute.", or "An
      ELEMENTAL procedure shall not have the BIND attribute."

  Bill Long's YES comment on F03/0086:

    It would be helpful to include a reference for the edit:
    [280:6-7].  Also, ELEMENTAL is not an "attribute" in the sense
    that we use that term in the standard.  Maybe something like
    "ELEMENTAL shall not be specified for a procedure with the BIND
    attribute.", or "An ELEMENTAL procedure shall not have the BIND
    attribute."

  Jim Xia's NO vote on F03/0086:

    I agree with the conclusion of the interp, but I see one minor
    issue in the edit.  In F2003 standard, ELEMENTAL is never refered
    to as an attribute.  Similarly but to a less degree, the term BIND
    attribute is mostly used for data objects but only a few places
    for procedures.  A procedure with "BIND attribute" is regularly
    referred to be with <proc-language-binding-spec>.  I'm willing to
    vote yes if the edit is changed to be consistent with the rest of
    the standard.

    A proposed edit:

     Replace C1242 in subclause 12.5.2.1 with
     "C1242 (R1227) A procedure shall not be specified with both
      ELEMENTAL and <proc-language-binding-spec>."

  Conclusion on F03/0086:  Passed J3 letter ballot #13 with the
                           following change:

    Change the edit in 07-006A/F03/0086 to read:

      Replace C1242 in subclause 12.5.2.1 with
      [280:6-7]
      "C1242 An ELEMENTAL procedure shall not have the BIND
       attribute.".

F03/0087   Entry names as dummy procedure arguments

  Dick Hendrickson's YES comment on F03/0087:

    I agree with Bill Long's comment:

      While we're fixing this constraint, we might as well fix the
      end of the sentence as well.  The end is "nor shall appear in an
      EXTERNAL, INTRINSIC, or PROCEDURE statement".  PROCEDURE
      statements, [258:27], appear only in interface blocks, and are
      not similar to EXTERNAL or INTRINSIC.  I suspect we really meant
      procedure declaration statements [264:9].

  Bill Long's YES comment on F03/0087:

    It would be helpful to include a reference for the edit:
    [283:10]. While we're fixing this constraint, we might as well
    fix the end of the sentence as well.  The end is "nor shall appear
    in an EXTERNAL, INTRINSIC, or PROCEDURE statement".  PROCEDURE
    statements, [258:27], appear only in interface blocks, and are not
    similar to EXTERNAL or INTRINSIC.  I suspect we really meant

F03/0088   Defined operations/assignments and VOLATILE/ASYNCHRONOUS

  Jim Xia's YES comment on F03/0088:

    Although the edit of this interp is correct, the declaration of
    the defined assignment used in the example is invalid.  The
    declaration violates the rules specified for defined assignment
    at [263:8-10], which says the following

      Either the second argument shall be an array whose rank differs
      from that of the first argument, the declared types and kind
      type parameters of the arguments shall not conform as specified
      in Table 7.8, or the first argument shall be of derived type.

    Subroutine s declared in the interp can not be used to specify a
    user defined assignment for rank-one arrays of type real from
    another rank-one array of type real.

    A modified example is suggested as follows:

      INTERFACE ASSIGNMENT(=)
        SUBROUTINE s(a,b)
          REAL,INTENT(OUT),VOLATILE :: a(1,*)
          REAL,INTENT(IN) :: b(:)
        END SUBROUTINE
      END
      REAL,POINTER :: p(:,:),q(:)
      ...
      CALL s(p,q)    ! Violation of constraint C1233 [271:9-11],
                     !  associating P with A
      p = q          ! No constraint violation because <actual-arg>
                     !  syntax is not being used

  Conclusion on F03/0088:  Passed J3 letter ballot #13 with the above
                           change in Jim Xia's ballot

F03/0090   Polymorphic array constructors

  Jim Xia's NO vote on F03/0090:

    Answer (2) of the interp says an array constructor is
    non-polymorphic with declared type and dynamic type both of T.  I
    see at least four problems with this answer:

    1) There is no requirement anywhere in the standard for RHS
       expression be non-polymorphic in an intrinsic assignment.  The
       array constructor can surely be interpreted as a polymorphic
       array, and the effect is the same as if a polymorphic pointer/
       allocatable array appears as the RHS expression in the
       assignment.  This interpretation will give the same results for
       the assignment.

    2) There are other potential usage of an array constructor
       containing polymorphic entities, such as an actual argument to
       be associated with a polymorphic dummy array, a selector in
       ASSOCIATE or SELECT TYPE construct, a <source-expr> in an
       ALLOCATE statement for a polymorphic pointer/allocatable array.
       It's appropriate to interpret it as a polymorphic array with
       the same declared type and dynamic type as those appearing in
       the array constructor, respectively.

    3) This interpretation prohibits use of unlimited polymorphic data
       in an array constructor because they don't have a declared
       type.  There is no rationale in banning unlimited polymorphic
       entities in an array constructor.

    4) The same effect of obtaining a non-polymorphic array
       constructor can already be achieved by using <type-spec>.

NUMBER: F03/0049
TITLE: Separators in list-directed output involving UDDTIO
KEYWORDS: list-directed output, separators, UDDTIO
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

MODULE m
  TYPE t
    INTEGER i
  END TYPE
  INTERFACE WRITE(FORMATTED)
    MODULE PROCEDURE formattedWriteT
  END INTERFACE
CONTAINS
  SUBROUTINE formattedWriteT(dtv, unit, iotype, v_list, iostat, iomsg)
    CLASS(t),         INTENT(IN)    :: dtv
    INTEGER,          INTENT(IN)    :: unit
    CHARACTER(LEN=*), INTENT(IN)    :: iotype
    INTEGER,          INTENT(IN)    :: v_list(:)
    INTEGER,          INTENT(OUT)   :: iostat
    CHARACTER(LEN=*), INTENT(INOUT) :: iomsg

    WRITE(unit, *) dtv%i, 'a'
  END SUBROUTINE
END MODULE

PROGRAM foo
  USE m
  TYPE(t) :: t1 = t(5)
  OPEN(10, FILE='foo.txt', ACCESS='SEQUENTIAL', FORM='FORMATTED', &
       DELIM='NONE')
  WRITE(10, *), 'xyz', t1, 'zyx'
END PROGRAM

10.9.2 of Fortran 2003 states that character sequences produced for
list-directed output are not separated from each other by value
separators when the delimiter mode is NONE.  The implication of this
is obvious when the adjacent effective output list items are both of
character type.  But when user-defined derived-type input/output
is involved, it is much less clear whether a separator should be
included in the output.

In the example given, it is unclear whether the output should be:
 xyz 5 azyx
or:
 xyz 5 a zyx

1. Should a separator be inserted between two non-delimited character
   sequences when one of the character sequences is written by a child
   data transfer statement, and the other is written by a parent data
   transfer statement, where both statements are list-directed?

2. Should a separator be inserted between two non-delimited character
   sequences when the character sequences are written by two different
   child data transfer statements, where both statements are
   list-directed?

3. Should a separator be inserted between two character sequences when
   one of the character sequences is written by a child data transfer
   statement, and the other is written by a parent data transfer
   statement, where one of the statements is list-directed and the
   other is format-directed?

4. Should a separator be inserted between two character sequences when
   the character sequences are written by two different child data
   transfer statements, where one of the statements is list-directed
   and the other is format-directed?

ANSWER:

1) No. It is the intent of the standard (10.9.2) that when both the
   parent and child data transfer statements are both list-directed
   output statements, or both are namelist output statements, the
   processor treats the first list item appearing in a child data
   transfer statement as if that list item had immediately
   followed the last list item processed by the parent data
   transfer statement, as long as no other data transfers to that
   unit occurred in between the processing of those two list items.
   Therefore, in this case, the two character sequences are
   considered adjacent.

2) No. It is the intent of the standard (10.9.2) that when two
   different child data transfer statements are both list-directed
   output statements, or both namelist output statements, they write
   to the same unit, and no other data transfers to that unit occur
   in between the two child data transfer statements, the processor
   treats the first list item appearing in the second child data
   transfer statement as if that list item had immediately followed
   the last list item processed by the first child data transfer
   statement.  Therefore, in this case, the two character sequences
   are considered adjacent.

3) It is processor dependent whether or not a separator appears
   between two such character sequences.  In section 10.9.2, the
   phrase "adjacent undelimited character sequences" refers to
   character sequences produced by list-directed output.  When one of
   the sequences is written by a child or parent output statement
   that is not list-directed, the exception described in the first
   paragraph of 10.9.2 does not apply. The other rules for inserting
   optional blanks around values in list-directed output allow the
   processor to insert optional leading and trailing blanks around a
   list item.  The standard does not specify when optional blanks are
   written; therefore, when two adjacent list items (the values
   thereof) are written to an output record, and only one of them was
   written by list-directed input/output, the standard does not specify
   whether or not any optional blanks appear between those values in
   the output record.

4) It is processor dependent whether or not a separator appears
   between two such character sequences.  See answer 3.

EDITS:

[241:5+] In Section 10.9.2, add the following to the end of the
         first paragraph:
  "Two undelimited character sequences are considered adjacent when
   both were written using list-directed input/output, no intervening
   data transfer or input/output file positioning operations occurred,
   and both were written either by a single data transfer statement,
   or during the execution of a parent data transfer statement along
   with its child data transfer statements."

TITLE: Questions about internal files
KEYWORDS: internal file, data transfer
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTIONS:

Question 1:

Fortran 2003 does not seem to prohibit this kind of recursive internal
input/output.  Was this program intended to be standard-conforming?
If so, then what does the program print?

MODULE m1
  CHARACTER(20) :: ifile = ''
CONTAINS
  CHARACTER(3) FUNCTION foo()
    WRITE(ifile, *) 'QWERTY'
    foo = 'abc'
  END FUNCTION
END MODULE

PROGRAM ex1
  USE m1
  WRITE(ifile, *) 'xyz', foo(), 'zyx'
  PRINT *, ifile
END PROGRAM

Question 2:

Fortran 2003 does not seem to prohibit this kind of recursive internal
Iinput/output.  Was this program intended to be standard-conforming?
If so, then what does the program print?

MODULE m2
  CHARACTER(20) :: ifile = 'abc def ghi jkl mno '
  CHARACTER(3) :: char
CONTAINS
  CHARACTER(3) FUNCTION foo()
    READ(ifile, *) char
    foo = 'abc'
  END FUNCTION
END MODULE

PROGRAM ex2
  USE m2
  WRITE(ifile, *) 'xyz', foo(), 'zyx'
  PRINT *, ifile
  PRINT *, char
END PROGRAM

Question 3:

Fortran 2003 does not appear to prohibit modifying a character
variable when it is being used as an internal file in a data transfer
statement that is currently executing.  Was this program intended to
be standard-conforming?  If so, then what does the program print?

MODULE m3
  CHARACTER(20) :: ifile = ''
CONTAINS
  CHARACTER(3) FUNCTION foo()
    ifile = 'bad thing to do?'
    foo = 'abc'
  END FUNCTION
END MODULE

PROGRAM ex3
  USE m3
  WRITE(ifile, *) 'xyz', foo(), 'zyx'
  PRINT *, ifile
  PRINT *, flag
END PROGRAM

Question 4:

Fortran 2003 does not appear to prohibit referencing a character
variable when it is being used as an internal file in a data transfer
statement that is currently executing.  Was this program intended to
be standard-conforming?  If so, then what does the program print?

MODULE m4
  CHARACTER(20) :: ifile = ''
  LOGICAL :: flag = .FALSE.
CONTAINS
  CHARACTER(3) FUNCTION foo()
    IF (ifile == ' xyz') THEN
      flag = .TRUE.

ANSWER:

All of these examples were intended to be prohibited.
Edits are provided to prohibit referencing or defining a variable used
as an internal unit as a result of evaluating any output list items, or
transferring values to any input list item.

EDITS:

In section 9.5.3.4, after the paragraph:
    "If an internal file has been specified, an input/output list item
    shall not be in the file or associated with the file."

add these paragraphs [196:29+]:

  "During the execution of an output statement that specifies an
  internal file, no part of that internal file shall be referenced,
  defined, or become undefined as the result of evaluating any output
  list item.

  During the execution of an input statement that specifies an
  internal file, no part of that internal file shall be defined
  or become undefined as the result of transferring a value to any
  input list item."

QUESTION:

 Is it allowed for a procedure to have both the BIND(C) and
 elemental attributes?

 Constraint C1242 disallows trivial ways of writing an elemental
 BIND(C) procedure. However, the following example achieves the
 effect for sub_c without violating the syntactic constraint.

   elemental subroutine sub(x)
     entry sub_c(x) bind(c)
   end subroutine sub

ANSWER:

 No, it is not allowed. Constraint C1242 was intended to disallow
 the combination of elemental and BIND(C), but it inadvertently
 failed to cover the case shown in the above example.

EDITS

 Replace C1242 in subclause 12.5.2.1 with
 [280:6-7]
 "C1242 An ELEMENTAL procedure shall not have the BIND attribute.".

PROBLEM:

  Fortran 2008 Unresolved Technical issue 097 asked a question that
  also affects Fortran 2003.  Consider this example:

          INTERFACE ASSIGNMENT(=)
             SUBROUTINE s(a,b)
                 REAL,INTENT(OUT),VOLATILE :: a(1,*)
                 REAL,INTENT(IN) :: b(:)
             END SUBROUTINE
          END
          REAL,POINTER :: p(:,:),q(:)
          ...
          CALL s(p,q)    ! Violation of constraint C1233 [271:9-11],
                         !  associating P with A
          p = q          ! No constraint violation because <actual-arg>
                         !  syntax is not being used

QUESTION:

  Did Fortran 2003 intend to enforce constraints on <actual-arg> in
  defined assignment?

ANSWER:

 Yes, the <actual-arg> constraints and restrictions should be enforced
 in defined assignment and in defined operator evaluation.

 Edits are provided below to do this.

EDITS:

  [262:16] add at the end of the paragraph
   " All restrictions and constraints that apply to actual arguments
    in a reference to the function also apply to the corresponding
    operands in the expression as if they were used as actual arguments."

  [263:12] insert after "the second argument."
   " All restrictions and constraints that apply to actual arguments
    in a reference to the subroutine also apply to the left-hand-side
    and to the right-hand-side enclosed in parentheses as if they were
    used as actual arguments."

NUMBER: F03/0089
TITLE:  Interoperability of non-BIND derived types
KEYWORDS: Interoperability, derived type
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

INTRODUCTION

Subclause 15.2.3 of 04-007 says [398:9-12]:

  "A Fortran derived type is interoperable with a C struct type if the
   derived-type definition of the Fortran type specifies BIND(C) (4.5.1),
   the Fortran derived type and the C struct type have the same number of
   components, and the components of the Fortran derived type have types
   and type parameters that are interoperable with the types of the
   corresponding components of the struct type."

QUESTIONS

  1. Is a Fortran derived type for which BIND(C) is not specified
     interoperable with any C struct type?

  2. Does a Fortran derived type interoperate with a C struct type that
     has a different number of components?

  3. Does a Fortran derived type interoperate with a C struct type that
     specifies the same components in a different order?

  4. Does a Fortran derived type with a pointer or allocatable component
     that has interoperable type and type parameters interoperate with
     any C struct type?

ANSWERS:

None of these Fortran derived types are interoperable with any C struct type.

EDITS:

  [398:9] Replace "if" by "if and only if".
