2. The final form of F03/0063 is

NUMBER: F03/0063
TITLE: Procedure pointers in BLOCK DATA program units
KEYWORDS: Procedure pointer, common block, block data
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

QUESTION:

It is clear that procedure pointers are permitted in common blocks.
However, due to the restrictions on BLOCK DATA program units, it seems
that such a common block can not appear in a BLOCK DATA program unit.

Was it intended that common blocks containing procedure pointers could
be initialized in a BLOCK DATA program unit?

ANSWER:

It was a mistake to try to allow procedure pointers in common blocks.

Edits are provided to correct this blunder.

F03/0063 contained a suggestion for F2008:

  'F2008 note: include edits above + [04-007/98:21-22 5.5.2 C588]
   Delete "a function name, an entry name," because these were
   originally synonyms for "a result name" (as applied to
   <variable-name> in R558).  Now, "a function name" (as applied to
   <proc-pointer-name> in R558) prohibits function pointers.'
