KEYWORDS: implicit interface, procedure pointer, dummy procedure, procedure reference

STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:
Is the following program legal:

_________________________
module test_mod

contains

subroutine reference(proc,choice)
    ! Proc has implicit interface
    external :: proc ! Or
        ! procedure(), pointer :: proc
    logical :: choice
    if(choice) then
       call proc(1.0) ! Call with real argument
    else
       call proc(1) ! Call with integer argument
    end if
end subroutine

subroutine proc_real(x)
   real :: x
end subroutine

subroutine proc_integer(x)
   integer :: x
end subroutine

end module

program test
   use test_mod
   call reference(proc_real,.true.)
   call reference(proc_integer,.false.)
end program
_________________________

12.3.2.5 says: "The type...of dummy arguments of a procedure referenced from a scoping unit
where the interface of  the procedure is implicit shall be such that the actual arguments
are consistent with the characteristics of the dummy arguments."
We define a procedure reference in 2.5.6 as the "appearance of  procedure designator,
... in a context requiring execution at that point."

Are both calls to proc above references, at compile time?
If both calls to proc are references than they both need to be consistent with the interface of the
actual argument associated with the dummy procedure. This is not possible and the program would be
illegal. However, if only the call executed counts as a reference, than the program is legal.

The same question applies to both dummy procedures and procedure pointers with implicit interfaces.

ANSWER:

No, the program is not legal---both calls to proc in the module subroutine reference are references
of the dummy procedure proc and thus must both be consistent with the interface of the actual.

EDITS:

In 2.5.6, replace "in a context requiring execution at that point" with "in a context which may
require execution of the procedure", or some other wording. The intent is to exclude appearances of
the procedure identifier in contexts which are not really procedure invocations.
