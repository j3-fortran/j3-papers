1. Introduction
---------------
From paper 96-063, April 3, 1996 (lightly edited):

   Frequently Fortran programmers need to maintain more than one
   version of a code, or to run the code in various environments. The
   easiest solution for the programmer is to keep a single source file
   that has all the code variations interleaved within it so that any
   version can be easily extracted. This way, modifications that apply
   to all versions need only be made once.

   Source code preprocessors have long been used to provide these
   capabilities. They allow the user to insert directive statements
   within the source code that affect the output of the preprocessor.
   In general, source code preprocessors permit the user to define
   special variables and logical constructs that conditionally control
   which source lines in the file are passed on to the compiler and
   which lines are skipped over. In addition, the preprocessor's
   capabilities allow the user to specify how the source code should
   be changed according to the value of defined string variables and
   functions.

   Historically, the source code preprocessor found in standard C
   compilers, CPP, has been used to provide Fortran programmers with
   these capabilities. However, CPP is too closely tied into the C
   language syntax and source line format to be used without careful
   scrutiny. The proposed Fortran PreProcessor, FPP, would provide
   Fortran-specific source code capabilities that C programmers have
   long grown to expect.

<end of text borrowed from 96-063>

Existing compiler implementations either use CPP directly, or implement
Fortran-oriented semantics of CPP in the processor. For simple use
cases, these implementations support similar functionality and behavior.

Many existing Fortran projects make extensive use of C preprocessor
directives and macro expansion, despite the lack of an FPP standard.
This is usually done to tailor the code to specific environments, such
as target compilers or machines.

Unfortunately, more complex use cases fail to be portable between
different implementations. This is enough of a problem that WG 5 raised
this as the number 2 issue to address in Fortran 202y, behind generics.

This is not a new problem, as evidenced by the J3 discussions from the
mid 1990s. The introduction of CoCo in Fortran 95 did not solve the
problem, either, because it was not a mandatory part of the standard and
because it was not compatible with the preprocessor syntax used by many
existing Fortran projects.

This document attempts to define the requirements for a mandatory
Fortran preprocessor based on the preprocessor syntax already in common
use today. The guiding principle is to promote Fortran program
portability by defining consistent syntax and semantics of a useful
subset of CPP. Some FPP behavior will be slightly different from CPP, in
order to accommodate some Fortran idiosyncrasies.

A major overarching goal of this effort is to standardize de facto
current practice for preprocessing in Fortran compilers and code. It is
the standard's responsibility to standardize syntax in order to settle
minor divergences that have arisen amongst pre-standard FPP
implementations, to the detriment of portability for end users.


2. The basic idea: phases before the "processor"
------------------------------------------------
The preprocessor will be a mandatory part of the language. Any file
passed to a processor may contain preprocessor directive lines.

The C standards define eight phases of the compilation process. These
phases don't prescribe the details of an implementation, but are useful
for defining in focused terms the expected behavior of implementations.

We plan to take a similar approach for defining FPP. This should
simplify the explanation of the expected behavior of any given
implementation.


3. FPP Phase 1: Line conjoining
-------------------------------
The C language defines phase 2 as a pass where continuation lines are
removed. To simplify the explanation of FPP's preprocessing phase 2, we
will define phase 1 to simply remove continuation lines seen in the
source file. This will apply to both fixed-form and free-form source
Fortran lines and preprocessor directive lines. The output of this phase
is a sequence of "logical lines", each of which may be up to 1 million
characters long. Logical lines are a sequence of strings and
comment-strings in the same order as they are encountered in the input
stream.


4. FPP Phase 2: Directive processing
------------------------------------
The directive processing phase is analogous to CPP phase 4. Preprocessor
directives are executed. Macros are expanded in non-directive lines
(Fortran source lines).

The directive language accepted by FPP is based on the syntax of CPP. It
has syntax that differs from Fortran, but macros can expand to include
arbitrary Fortran tokens. It differs from C and Fortran syntax in the
following ways.

Token recognition:
    1. FPP's directives and token recognition are case sensitive.
    2. FPP treats blanks adjacent to tokens as significant, even in
       fixed-form source files.

Line continuation in directives:
    1. FPP directive lines accept backslash (\) for line continuations.
    2. FPP does not recognize fixed-form (column 6) or free-form (&)
       continuations on directive lines.

Comment handling:
    1. FPP does not recognize '!' as initiating a comment on directive
       lines. In #if and #elif directive expressions, '!' is interpreted
       as the C 'not' operator.
    2. FPP does not recognize '//' as initiating a comment on directive
       lines. '//' can be used to construct macro definitions that
       contain Fortran string concatenation.
    3. FPP recognizes /* ... */ C-style comments on directive lines.
       /* ... */ comments are not recognized in (non-directive)
       Fortran source lines.
    4. Macros are expanded in comment lines that appear to be directives
       (processor-specific, such as '!$omp', or '!$acc', or others).

Constant expressions in #if and #elif:
    1. Expressions in #if and #elif directives allow operators from CPP.
    2. Expressions in #if and #elif directives must be integer constant
       expressions as specified for CPP (with the extensions described
       below), and evaluate to INTEGER values. As in CPP, zero values
       are treated as 'false'. Non-zero values are treated as 'true'.
    3. Any undefined identifiers that remain after macro expansion
       (including those lexically identical to keywords or intrinsics)
       are treated as zero, as in CPP.
    4. C character constants (such as 'A', '\n') are treated as
       integer values, as they are in CPP.
    5. There are no KIND specifiers on integer constants in the
       preprocessor.
    6. Integer expressions in preprocessor directives are evaluated
       using the integer kind that has the largest decimal exponent range
       supported by the processor.


4.1. Directives accepted by the preprocessor
--------------------------------------------
The following preprocessor directives will have the same semantics
as defined in the C23 edition of the C programming language standard.
    #line
    #define  including function-like macros and those
             that use the ellipsis notation in the parameters
    #undef
    #if, #elif, #else, #endif
    #ifdef, #ifndef, #elifdef, #elifndef
    #include
    #error
    #warning
    #pragma

Just as #include lines interpolate the source from other files, the
preprocessor will include the text from Fortran INCLUDE lines. Text
interpolated by INCLUDE lines will be treated as if it had been included
via #include.


4.2 Tokens recognized in #define directives
-------------------------------------------
The following tokens are recognized in the replacement-list of a #define
directive and handled by the preprocessor during expansion:
    - # (stringify operator)
    - ## (token concatenation operator)
    - Any previously #defined macro name
    - Any argument name in a function-like macro
    - __VA_ARGS__  in the replacement-list of a function-like macro
                   that uses the ellipsis notation in the parameters.
    - __VA_OPT__   in the replacement-list of a function-like macro
                   that use the ellipsis notation in the parameters.

Any other text in the replacement-list is preserved unchanged during
macro expansion, and may for example include any tokens valid in Fortran
or C.


4.3 Operators accepted in #if and #elif expressions
---------------------------------------------------
    - The "defined" operator
    - From C: && || !          (logical operators)
              == != < > <= >=  (equality- and relational-expression)
              + -              (additive-expression, also unary forms)
              * / %            (multiplicative-expression)
              & | ^ ~ << >>    (bitwise operators)
              ? :              (conditional-expression)
              ( )              (parenthetical grouping)

Earlier revisions of this document considered allowing Fortran syntax in
#if and #elif expressions, such as:
    = /= .AND. .OR. .NOT. .TRUE. .FALSE.
but we eventually decided to omit these due to a lack of compelling
use cases.


4.4 Macros defined by the preprocessor
---------------------------------------------
    __LINE__
    __FILE__
    __DATE__
    __TIME__
    __STDF__

__STDF__ is an analog to __STDC__ in C and __cplusplus in C++. Its
primary role is to provide preprocessor-visible and vendor-independent
identification of the underlying target language (i.e., "the processor
is Fortran"), which enables one to write multi-language header files
with conditional compilation based on language.


4.5. Fortran awareness during macro expansion
---------------------------------------------
Just as CPP does not expand tokens in strings, there are places in
Fortran lines that FPP should not recognize or expand tokens.

FPP will not expand in fixed-form:
    - A token "C" or "c" in column 1.
    - Anything in column 6.


FPP will not expand tokens in either fixed- or free-form:
    - In character literal constants.
    - In character string edit descriptors (quoted character strings).


4.6 Output of Phase 2
---------------------
Similar to phase 1, the output is a sequence of logical lines where the
logical lines contain the strings representing the now-preprocessed
characters of the input file and comment-strings.
