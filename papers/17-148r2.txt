Subject: Unclear intent for TEAM behavior

Discussion:

This paper is a response for Ballot Comment US017.

11.1.5.2 p5 states

  "All active images of the current team shall execute the same
   CHANGE TEAM statement."

It is unclear what behavior these words are trying to protect against.
The synchronization rules that apply when a CHANGE TEAM statement is
executed require all images of a (sub)team that will be the new
current team inside the CHANGE TEAM construct arrive before any images
can continue.

I suspect these words are trying to prohibit something like the
following:


  USE,INTRINSIC   :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
  TYPE(TEAM_TYPE) :: team_a, team_b

  FORM TEAM (<expr_1>, team_a)
  FORM TEAM (<expr_2>, team_b)
  IF (MOD(THIS_IMAGE(), 2)
    CHANGE TEAM (team_a)
  ELSE
    CHANGE TEAM (team_b)
  ENDIF

which is a good thing to prohibit. But they also prohibit

  USE,INTRINSIC    :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
  TYPE(TEAM_TYPE)  :: odd_even

  FORM TEAM (2-MOD(THIS_IMAGE(), 2) odd_even)
  ...
  IF (MOD(THIS_IMAGE(), 2) == 0)
    ! Set up for TEAM 2
    ....
    CHANGE TEAM (odd_even)  ! Even numbered images execute this
    ...
    END TEAM
  ELSE
    ! Set up for TEAM 1
    ...
    CHANGE TEAM (odd_even)  ! Odd numbered images execute this
    ! Team 1 tasks
    ...
    END TEAM
  ENDIF

which may be a straight forward way of expressing different work for
different subteams.

These words do seem to permit different images on the current
team to execute a CHANGE TEAM statement a differing number of times
and at independent times from other images on the current team, as long
as all images of the current team execute the CHANGE TEAM at least once
during the execution of the program.

The following appears to be conforming.  All images execute the change
team at least once, but team 1 enters the CHANGE TEAM construct twice
while team 2 enters it once.

  USE,INTRINSIC   :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
  TYPE(TEAM_TYPE) :: odd_even
  ...
  ! Form 2 teams, odd image indices on team 1, even indices on team 2
  FORM TEAM (2-MOD(THIS_IMAGE(), 2), odd_even)
  DO i = 1, 3
    IF (2-MOD(THIS_IMAGE()) == (2-MOD(i,2)))
      CHANGE TEAM (odd_even) ! Team 1 executes twice, team 2 once
        ...
      END TEAM
    END IF
  END DO

A simple modification of the DO loop makes it non-conforming:

  USE,INTRINSIC   :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
  TYPE(TEAM_TYPE) :: odd_even
  ...
  ! Form 2 teams, odd image indices on team 1, even indices on team 2
  FORM TEAM (2-MOD(THIS_IMAGE(), 2), odd_even)
  DO i = 1, 3, 2
    IF (2-MOD(THIS_IMAGE()) == (2-MOD(i,2)))
      CHANGE TEAM (odd_even) ! Team 2 doesn't execute this
        ...
      END TEAM
    END IF
  END DO

It is surprising the intent is to allow two sibling subteams to enter
a CHANGE TEAM construct a different number of times, but zero is not a
valid number of times for one subteam if another sibling subteam enters
the construct at all.

I believe the words we have underspecify some desired restriction(s)
while at the same time may over-restrict some desirable practice. As i
do not understand exactly what is meant to be prohibited and what is
meant to be allowed, i am unable to suggest how to fix it.


Response

Subgroup decision is that the requirement that all images of the
current team execute the same CHANGE TEAM statement is unnecessary. An
edit is provided to remove that requirement.  Another edit corrects an
error found in NOTE 11.6.


Edits to N2123 (17-007r1)

[xx:3-] At the end of the last bullet in para 2 of Introduction, which
begins "Changes to features previously described by ISO/IEC TS
18508:2015:", add a new sentence: "All images of the current team are
no longer required to execute the same CHANGE TEAM statement."

[188:20] In 11.1.5.2 Execution of a CHANGE TEAM construct, delete para
5 that reads "All active images of the current team shall execute the
same CHANGE TEAM statement."

[188:32+] In 11.1.5.2 Execution of a CHANGE TEAM construct, NOTE 11.6,
para 2, change
"If it is desired to synchronize all of the images in the team that is
current when CHANGE TEAM begins execution, a SYNC ALL statement can be
inserted just before the CHANGE TEAM statement."
to
"If it is desired to synchronize all of the images in the team that was
current when the CHANGE TEAM construct began execution, a SYNC TEAM
statement that specifies the parent team can be executed immediately
after the CHANGE TEAM statement."
