NUMBER: TBD
TITLE: Volatile and association
KEYWORD: VOLATILE
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION 1:

Are variants a to f of example 1 supposed to be conforming?  In any
cases that these are conforming, is the first PRINT statement required
to print the original count and the second the updated count?

PROGRAM Main
    USE Counting_Module
    INTEGER, VOLATILE :: count
    count = 0
    CALL Start_Counting(count)    ! Start some external agent
    CALL Fred(count)
CONTAINS
    SUBROUTINE Fred (arg)
        INTEGER :: arg                        ! Example 1(a)
        ! INTEGER, VALUE :: arg               ! Example 1(b)
        ! INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: arg          ! Example 1(c)
        ! INTEGER, TARGET :: arg              ! Example 1(d)
        ! INTEGER, VOLATILE :: arg            ! Example 1(e)
        PRINT *, arg
        CONTINUE ! Assume that the agent increments the count here
        PRINT *, arg
    END SUBROUTINE Fred
END PROGRAM Main


QUESTION 2:

Is the following example supposed to be conforming?  If it is, is the
first PRINT statement required to print the original counts and the
second the updated counts?

PROGRAM Main
    USE Counting_Module
    INTEGER, VOLATILE :: counts(5)
    count = 0
    CALL Start_Counting(counts)    ! Start some external agent
    CALL Fred(counts(::3))
CONTAINS
    SUBROUTINE Fred (arg)
        INTEGER :: arg(*)
        PRINT *, arg(:2)
        CONTINUE ! Assume that the agent increments the counts here
        PRINT *, arg(:2)
    END SUBROUTINE Fred
END PROGRAM Main


QUESTION 3:

Is the following example supposed to be conforming, and to print the
values before and after the update?

MODULE Weeble
    INTEGER :: data = 123
END MODULE Weeble

MODULE Wobble
    USE Weeble, alias => data
    PRIVATE :: data
    VOLATILE :: alias
END MODULE Wobble

PROGRAM Main
    USE Counting_Module
    USE Wobble
    CALL Start_Counting(alias)    ! Start some external agent
    CALL Fred
CONTAINS
    SUBROUTINE Fred    ! In general, an external subroutine
        USE Weeble
        INTEGER :: temp
        temp = data
        CONTINUE ! Assume that the agent updates data/alias here
        PRINT *, temp, data
    END SUBROUTINE Fred
END PROGRAM Main


QUESTION 4:

Is the following example supposed to be conforming, and to print the
values before and after the update?

MODULE Weeble
    INTEGER, ALLOCATABLE :: data(:)
END MODULE Weeble

MODULE Wobble
    USE Weeble, alias => data
    VOLATILE :: alias
END MODULE Wobble

PROGRAM Main
    USE Wobble
    INTERFACE
        SUBROUTINE Start_Counting (arg)
            INTEGER, ALLOCATABLE, VOLATILE :: arg(:)
        END SUBROUTINE Start_Counting
    END INTERFACE
    ALLOCATE(alias(3))
    CALL Start_Counting(alias)    ! Start some external agent
    CALL Fred
CONTAINS
    SUBROUTINE Fred    ! In general, an external subroutine
        USE Weeble
        INTEGER, ALLOCATABLE :: temp(:)
        ALLOCATE(temp(1:UBOUND(data,1)),SOURCE=data)
        CONTINUE ! Assume that the agent updates data/alias here
        PRINT *, temp, data
    END SUBROUTINE Fred
END PROGRAM Main


DISCUSSION:

Question 1:

It is unclear whether "by means not specified by the program" (5.3.19p1)
is constrained by the requirement to act only through the dummy argument
(12.5.2.13) or not.

If the restriction in 12.5.2.13 applies only to program action, then
they are all legal.  Most compilers would use the latest value for 1(e)
and possibly 1(d), not for 1(b), but might not for the others.  In
particular, doing so for 1(c) would conflict with 5.3.10p2.

If it is forbidden by 12.5.2.13, all of these examples are undefined,
except for 1(d), but including 1(e).  That is, at best, confusing.  1(d)
is also likely to cause implementation problems, because it requires
compilers to generate code for a non-volatile argument to handle data
races with an unspecified external agent.

Question 2:

This is just to show the interaction with sequence association.  The
case where the VOLATILE attribute is specified for arg in subroutine
Fred is already excluded by C1239.

Questions 3 and 4:

These are just to show that similar issues arise with other forms of
association.  5.3.19p2 makes it clear that the aliasing is permitted for
use, host, and construct association.  Pointer association is already
covered in 5.3.19p3 by "If, by means not specified by the program, the
target is referenced, defined, or becomes undefined, the pointer shall
have the VOLATILE attribute."  Linkage association is probably immune,
but I cannot be sure.

General:

To ensure atomicity of the sort needed by volatile accesses, ALL
accesses and association need to have special code generated for them,
and not just the ones where the VOLATILE attribute is visible.  Even
on systems where the same instructions are generated for both, many
optimisations must not be used.

The simplest solution would be to place a constraint on all forms of
association, not just pointer association, as has been done for
ASYNCHRONOUS (5.3.4p2), and refer to that in 16.5.1.1.  Note that the
restriction has to be fairly draconian, because of the above problems.
The approach proposed is to forbid all 'alien' updates during the period
that the object is associated with any object without the VOLATILE
attribute.  No reliable or portable program should be affected.

I am not happy about the wording, but there doesn't seem to be a simple
way of specifying the large number of conditions needed.

There is currently no exemption for the VALUE attribute in 12.5.2.13, so
I assume that none is needed in this case.


ANSWER:

Question 1:

Only examples 1(b) and 1(e) are supposed to be conforming; the former is
required to print the values before the update, twice, and the latter is
required to print the values before and after the update.  Edits are
provided to correct the defect.

Questions 2, 3 and 4: these examples are not intended to be conforming,
and edits are provided to correct the defect.


EDITS to 14/007r2:

[102] 5.3.19p4+ after paragraph 4, as a new paragraph:

    "An object that has the VOLATILE attribute and is associated with an
     object that does not have the VOLATILE attribute shall not
     * become defined or undefined or
     * have its association status, dynamic type and type parameters,
       or array bounds changed
     by means not specified by the program.

[443] 16.5.1.1 after paragraph 1, add a new paragraph:

    "The rules governing actions by means not specified by the program
    are given in Clause 5, under the VOLATILE attribute."
