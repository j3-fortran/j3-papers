Edits to 12-119:

--------------------
 In 7.2 RANK, The example does not really make clear why this function
is needed. Replacing the existing sentence by

"If X is a dummy argument declared with REAL X(..) and is argument
 associated with an effective argument that was declared REAL
 Y(:,:,:), RANK(X) has the value 3."

{Modified slightly from Reinhold's original.}

---------------------

In 8.3.5.5 CFI_establish, in the paragraph following the extents
description, in the penultimate sentence change


"... but does not describe a Fortran assumed-shape array".

to

"... but does not describe a data object."

{Objects other that assumed-shape arrays are included in the list of
things not described.}

---------------------

In 8.6 Restrictions on lifetimes, paragraph 2, last sentence, change

"object it describes" to " object described by the C descriptor".

{Clarify "it".}

-----------------------

In 8.7 Interoperability of procedures and procedure interfaces,
paragraph 5, second sentence (top of page 31) change:

"The C descriptor shall describe an object with the same characteristics
 as the effective argument; "

to

"The value of the \cf{attribute} member of the C descriptor shall be
compatible with the characteristics of the dummy argument. The members
of the C descriptor other than \cf{attribute} and \cf{type} shall
describe an object with the same characteristics as the effective
argument. The type member"

{In a call from Fortran to C, the attribute member of a C descriptor
pointed to by a formal parameter gets its value from the corresponding
dummy argument in the Fortran interface. This is necessary because of
cases such as an allocatable actual argument corresponding to an
assumed-shape dummy in the interface. The attribute has to be
determined by the assumed-shape dummy and not the allocatable actual.
The other members in the descriptor get their values from the
corresponding effective argument, because the corresponding dummy in
the interface could be assumed type or assumed rank. Whether an object
is allocatable, pointer, or neither is a characteristic, so the
current sentence is misleading.}


------------------------
In 8.7 Interoperability of procedures and procedure interfaces,
in the last paragraph add a sentence:


"An absent optional dummy argument in a reference to an interoperable
procedure is indicated by a corresponding argument with the value of
a null pointer."

{Cover the case of a called procedure in Fortran.}

-------------------- 

 In 9.8 Edits to clause 13, in the edits for 12.7.137a RANK, Replacing
the existing sentence following "Example." with

"If X is a dummy argument declared with REAL X(..) and is argument
 associated with an effective argument that was declared REAL
 Y(:,:,:), RANK(X) has the value 3."
