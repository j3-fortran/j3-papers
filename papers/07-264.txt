Discussion

An intrinsic assignment to a allocatable variable should not involve
the allocation of a co-array since this would require the synchronization
of all images. The rules in the first paragraph of 7.2.1.2 disallow most
of the situations that might cause this to happen, but the case of a
variable with a co-array ultimate component is not fully covered.
If the variable is a co-array or a co-indexed object, we do not allow
it to be polymorphic or have a length type parameter that differs from
the corresponding type parameter of the expression. We need to add the
case of its having a co-array ultimate component.


Edit to J3/07-007r2

[171:20] In 7.2.1.2 Intrinsic assignment statement, para. 1, item (5),
 replace "or co-indexed object" by ", a co-indexed object,
or of a type that has a co-array ultimate component".

[172:5] In 7.2.1.2 Intrinsic assignment statement, para. 1, item (8),
 replace "or co-indexed object" by ", is not a co-indexed object, is
not of a type that has a co-array ultimate component".
