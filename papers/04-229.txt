Title: C Interoperability of strided arrays

Submitted by: J3

Status: For Consideration

References: Fortran 2003 FCD

Basic Functionality: 

Allow for users to manipulate Fortran strided arrays (assumed-shape or
array pointers) in C, and for Fortran to manipulate strided arrays from
C. In particular, add a C_STRIDES intrinsic, in the same category as
C_LOC, which will return a rank 1 array giving the strides of an
possibly noncontiguous array along each dimension. Additionally, allow
strided (noncontiguous arrays) arguments to C_LOC (they are forbidden
at present), and specify that the address of the first element (I will
refer to this as a base address) is returned. Also add a C_STRIDES
argument to C_F_POINTER which can accept strides, to allow creating a
Fortran array pointer to strided data from C. This proposal specifies
that all strides are to be in bytes (although we are may switch to bits
if all the other storage-related intrinsics we add are in bits). 

Rationale: 

There are many C (or other compatible languages) libraries which are
capable of dealing with strided arrays, and have their own array
descriptors. It is a shame that Fortran 2003 allows no easy way to pass
strided arrays to C. Additionally, it is possible that users of such
arrays would like to call some Fortran numerical routine. While this
proposal does not allow for direct interoperability between Fortran's
noncontiguous arrays (assumed-shape dummies and array pointers) and C
constructs, it gives tools that can be used to create suitable
wrappers. Only the C_STRIDES argument to C_F_POINTER adds functionality
to what is already in Fortran 2003. For example, the base address can
already be gotten by calling C_LOC for the first element of an array:

base_addresss=C_LOC(LBOUND(A,1),LBOUND(A,2),...)

Strides can be obtained by getting the C address of two consecutive
elements of an array and performing pointer arithmetic in C. But it is
not possible (to my knowledge) to create a Fortran array pointer to an
array of 8-byte reals with a stride of 12 bytes (i.e. 4 bytes of
padding between consecutive elements), and such arrays do occur in real
life. 

Estimated Impact: 

This is indeed trivial to implement, since strides are stored in array
descriptors anyway. It may be more difficult to describe, but we already
fudge our way in C interop so we may just rely on "everyone knows what
this means".

Detailed Specification: 

I will not give detailed specs here:

A new intrinsic function C_STRIDES(ARRAY [, DIM]) is provided, similar
to LBOUND/UBOUND, which returns the stride in bytes between two
successive elements of the array along the given dimension, i.e., the
distance in bytes between the storage locations of
ARRAY(LBOUND(ARRAY,1),...,LBOUND(ARRAY,dim),...,LBOUND(ARRAY,rank)) and
ARRAY(LBOUND(ARRAY,1),...,LBOUND(ARRAY,dim)+1,...,LBOUND(ARRAY,rank)).
If the extent along dim is less than 2, the processor can return any
number? I would recomment that no KIND argument be provided and the
result be of type INTEGER(C_INT).

The prohibition against noncontiguous arguments to C_LOC should be
lifted and it be specified that the C address of the first element of
the array in array element order is returned.

An optional argument C_STRIDES should be added to C_F_POINTER, which
can accept a rank-1 array giving the strides along each dimension
(similar to the current SHAPE argument). The type should be specified
to be of type INTEGER(C_INT), rather than any integer? In particular,
the following essentially does q=>p:

real, dimension(100,100), target :: a
real, dimension(:,:), pointer :: p, q
integer :: strides

p=>a(1:100:3,5:50:2)

! A round-about way of saying q=>p
call c_f_pointer(cptr=c_loc(p), fptr=q,  &
   shape=shape(p), strides=c_strides(p))
