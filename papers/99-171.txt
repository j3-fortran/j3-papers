1. Introduction

The editor has called to our attention that people who are not using
extensible types will not think of looking in SELECT TYPE to find the
ASSOCIATE facility.  The syntax is also weird and inconvenient - "SELECT
TYPE"
and "TYPE DEFAULT are misleading.

Therefore we propose that a separate (but very similar) construct should be
used for accessing the ASSOCIATE facility when type-selection is not
required.

2. Syntax

   ASSOCIATE ( <associate-name> => <expr> [ , <associate-name> => <expr>
]... )
     ...
   END ASSOCIATE

Each <associate-name> is a construct entity that has the scope of the
ASSOCIATE block, just like the <associate-name> in a SELECT TYPE.

For consistency, we should change our existing
   SELECT TYPE ( <expr> ) [ ASSOCIATE( <name> ) ]
to
   SELECT TYPE ( [ <name> => ] <expr> )

3. Examples

Before these changes, an example might look like this:

   TYPE(MYTYPE) AX,AY
   ...
   SELECT TYPE ( AX%B(I,J)%D ) ASSOCIATE ( ZX )
   TYPE DEFAULT
     SELECT TYPE ( AY%B(I,J)%D ) ASSOCIATE ( ZY )
     TYPE DEFAULT
       W = ZX*X + ZY*Y
     END SELECT
   END SELECT

After these changes, it would look like this:

   TYPE(MYTYPE) AX,AY
   ...
   ASSOCIATE ( Z1 => AX%B(I,J)%D, Z2 => AY%B(I,J)%D )
     W = ZX*X + ZY*Y
   END ASSOCIATE

4. Discussion

Given this construct, it no longer makes sense to allow SELECT TYPE on non-
polymorphic expressions; therefore we limit SELECT TYPE to polymorphic
exprs.

5. Edits

{Add the ASSOCIATE construct to the list of executable constructs}
[11:2+] Add new line "<<or>> <associate-construct>".

{Allow the blank between END and ASSOCIATE to be omitted}
[27:33+] Add new line "END ASSOCIATE".

{Change SELECT TYPE syntax to be consistent with new ASSOCIATE}
[176:24-25] Change "( <type-selector>) [ ASSOCIATE ( <associate-name> ) ]"
            To     "( [ <associate-name> => ] <type-selector> )".

{Require the SELECT TYPE type-selector to be polymorphic.}
[176:30+] Add new constraint
"Constraint: <selector> shall be polymorphic."

{Since we only allow polymorphic expressions in SELECT TYPE, TYPE IS should
require an extensible type name.  This also fixes the <type-name> problem.}
[176:31] Change "<type-name>" to "<extensible-type-name>"

{SELECT TYPE type-selector is polymorphic, so the associate-name in the
TYPE DEFAULT block is polymorphic}
[177:29] After "name" insert "is polymorphic and"
[177:30-31] Delete "; it is ... polymorphic"

{Delete old example}
[178:27-33] Delete.

{Add new syntax}
[178:33+] Insert new section and renumber existing 8.1.5
"8.1.5 ASSOCIATE construct

The ASSOCIATE construct associates a name with an expression during the
execution of its block.

8.1.5.1  Form of the ASSOCIATE construct

R820a <associate-construct> <<is>> <associate-stmt>
                                   <block>
                                   <end-associate-stmt>

R820b <associate-stmt> <<is>> [ <associate-construct-name> : ] &
                              ASSOCIATE ( <association> &
                              [ , <association> ]... )

R820c <association> <<is>> <associate-name> => <selector>
Constraint: If <selector> is not a <variable>, <associate-name> shall not
            appear in a variable definition context (14.7.7).

R820d <selector> <<is>> <expr>
                 <<or>> <variable>

R820e <end-associate-stmt> <<is>> END ASSOCIATE [ <associate-construct-name>
]

Constraint: If the <associate-stmt> of an <associate-construct> specifies an
            <associate-construct-name>, the corresponding
<end-associate-stmt>
            shall specify the same <associate-construct-name>.  If the
            <associate-stmt> of an <associate-construct> does not specify an
            <associate-construct-name>, the corresponding
<end-associate-stmt>
            shall not specify an <associate-construct-name>.

8.1.5.2 Execution of the ASSOCIATE construct

Execution of an ASSOCIATE construct causes execution of its block.  During
execution of that block each associate name is associated (14.6.1.4) with
the
corresponding selector.  The associate name assumes the type, type
parameters,
rank, and bounds of the selector.  If the selector is not definable, its
associate name is not definable.  The associate name is polymorphic if and
only if the selector is polymorphic.

Execution of an ASSOCIATE construct with a selector that is not a <variable>
causes that selector expression to be evaluated prior to execution of the
block.

It is permissible to branch to an END ASSOCIATE statement only from within
the
ASSOCIATE construct.

8.1.5.3 Example of the ASSOCIATE construct

Note 8.13
ASSOCIATE ( Z ) WITH ( EXP(-(X**2+Y**2)) * COS(THETA) )
  PRINT *, A+Z, A-Z
END ASSOCIATE
".

{Add association information to ch14}
[372:2+] Insert
"Execution of an ASSOCIATE statement establishes an association between each
selector and the corresponding associate name of the ASSOCIATE construct.
The
associate name remains associated to its selector throughout the execution
of
the construct.  Within the ASSOCIATE construct, each selector is known by
and
may be accessed by its associate name.  Upon termination of the ASSOCIATE
construct, the association is terminated.".
