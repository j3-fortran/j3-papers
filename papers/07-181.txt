1. Monday, February 12, 2007  8:00 AM
-------------------------------------

    The J3 meeting (#179) was called to order at 8:00 AM, Monday,
    February 12, 2007, at the Emerald Suites, Las Vegas, NV, USA,
    by the J3 chair, Dan Nagle.

1.1 Opening business                              D. Nagle

    The Chairman welcomed everyone.

1.1.1 Remarks from the chair                     D. Nagle

    J3 notes with sadness that Ken Kennedy passed away last week.

    We are not in accord with WG5 Delft and Fairfax resolutions.  We
    have been putting in too much effort on the B list items, not on
    the A list or Interpretations.  We need to think about dropping
    B list items whose specifications we are still changing.  Macros
    and Bits are still taking too much time.  We should think about
    how we are spending our time and discuss plans later in the week.

    J. Martin:  Malcolm's latest 008 document shows our current
    status, but is not on the web site.

    V. Snyder:  The resolutions apply on a meeting by meeting basis.
    We should finish A list and Interps at the start of the week
    before we work on lower priority items.

    D. Nagle:  Yes, but we are still adding functionality at this
    meeting and we only have one more editorial meeting.  We should
    not slip the schedule.

    For this meeting /C should focus only on co-arrays and not follow
    the planned /A,/B,/C paper distribution.  /C papers are assigned
    to /A or /B.  All co-array papers are assigned to /C.

1.1.2 Adoption of agenda                         D. Nagle

**  motion: Adopt the agenda as amended (moved by Dick Hendrickson/
            seconded by Craig Rasmussen): passed by unanimous consent
            {uc}

1.1.3 Approval of Meeting 177 minutes            D. Nagle

**  motion: Approve paper 06-382, the minutes of meeting #178
            (Long/Hendrickson): uc

1.1.4 INCITS/SDB report (if any)                 D. Nagle

    J3 did not take votes at the last meeting in the format INCITS
    prefers.  We will need to revote one issue at the TAG meeting
    about reaffirming or withdrawing Fortran 90 after rewording th
    motion.

1.1.5 OWG-V report (if any)                      D. Nagle

    They continue to meet.  They are concerned about small number of
    members, 8 regular members.  C++ is not represented.

    They were very pleased about our processor dependency annex.

    Fortran arrays are being used as their model for discussing how
    arrays should be handled.

1.1.6 ISO/WG5 report                             Van Snyder, IR

    There will be a tag meeting on withdrawing Fortran 90.

1.1.7 J11 Liaison report (if any)                C. Rasmussen

    Nothing to report.  No comments on paper 06-280.

    The C committee is taking preliminary steps about doing another
    revision to C.  Perhaps C-11 or C-13 or so.  This might affect C
    interoperability in the future.

1.1.8 H2 Liaison report (if any)                 D. Nagle

    Approaching deadline for all 9 parts.

1.1.9 IEEE 754 report (if any)                   M. Ingrassia

    72 members approved the draft, but still many technical issues.

1.1.10 Treasurer's report                         V. Snyder

    There were many problems attempting to get a new J3 bank account.
    Currently it is named the "J3 COBOL" committee.  This should be
    resolved soon.

    $2801.80 is current balance (includes $100 for initial balance in
    the new account).

    The meeting fee is $50.00 .

**  motion:  Exempt John Reid and John Wallin from the meeting fee
             (Nagle/Snyder): uc

    S. Whitlock


    Matthijs van Waveren was in jeopardy of losing membership because
    of missing 2 of the last 3 meetings.  Toon Moene (his alternate) is
    at this meeting, which is the first step in removing the jeopardy.

    No one is in jeopardy of losing membership because of missing 2 of
    the last 3 letter ballots.

    Van Snyder is acting local host and will provide supplies as
    requested.

    We are rotating hosts: Michael Ingrassia will be host next time.


1.1.13 Comments from members

    Whitlock:  Everyone should take a look at 07-001 in the
    pre-meeting and update any information that is incorrect.

    Hendrickson:  Should default e-mail reply go to the group or to
    the individual sender?  Discussion about what to do.

      Straw Vote {SV}
        leave reply to as is             1
        set reply to the list            6
        Undecided                        3

      Dan Nagle will talk to Richard Bleikamp.

    Martin:  Will anyone reply to the call for a new chair?  Dan Nagle
    says he will reapply soon.

    Paper 153 from Bleikamp gives details about how to automatically
    submit papers via the new web site for the pre-meeting.  For the
    actual meeting, continue to upload to the daily folders.

    Snyder:  This is the 50th anniversary of Fortran.  Should we try to
    have a meeting in the bay area next May, perhaps meet at the Computer
    History Museum as a way to celebrate?

    No other comments from members were recorded.

           (Long/Whitlock): withdrawn

  /J3

    A discussion of insuring the quality of Fortran 2008 vs keeping to
    the existing schedule: we could drop macros or we could simplify
    BITS - either would remove contentious points and help us stay on
    schedule.  Specifications for macros are still changing;  specs for
    BITS are done but the words keep changing.  We will process macro
    papers last this week in a effort to get everything else done.  Macros
    could be made into a TR after F08 easier than ripping BITS out of
    F08 and making BITS a TR.
