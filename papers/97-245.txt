Subject:      Interpretation Request: Optional Arguments to MAX/MIN


NUMBER:       8
TITLE:        Optional arguments to MAX/MIN
KEYWORDS:     intrinsic function, MAX, MIN, optional, argument
DEFECT TYPE:  Interpretation 
STATUS:       X3J3 consideration in progress

BACKGROUND:
Dick Hendrickson originally posed the question contained in this
Interpretation Request.  As will be seen in the Addendum, Richard Maine agrees
with me that this question needs an official response.  Hence, I am submitting
on Dick's behalf (to steal a little more of his thunder).  I have combined 
some of his and Richard's words.  Any misstatements in transcription are most
likely mine.  This intro should be deleted later in the interp process.


QUESTION:
It appears that there is a missing "optional" in the description of the 
optional arguments [, A3, ...] in the MAX and MIN functions.  In the Fortran 90
standard, the MAX/MIN descriptions said "optional arguments.  A3, ...", but
those words do not appear 13.14.64 of the Fortran 95 standard.

Section 13.3 [217:27+] states

  ...optional arguments... are identified by the notation "optional" in
  the argument descriptions.

and goes on to describe another notation for the arguments that are listed as
optional.  But it doesn't say anything about arguments given in [...] and NOT
also listed as optional.

Suggested change to the argument descriptions for MAX and MIN:

Arguments.
A1, A2     shall both have the same type which shall be integer or real
           and they shall both have the same kind type parameter.

A3, ... (optional)  shall have the same type and kind type parameter as A1.

Subject: (x3j3.1997-309) Is A3 optional for MAX or MIN functions

My guess is that there is a missing "optional" in the description of
[, A3, ...] in the MAX and MIN functions.  In F90 the MAX/MIN descriptions
said "optional arguments.  A3,...", but I can't find those words
in F95 13.14.64

Section 13.3 (217:27) says "...optional arguments... are identified by the
notation "optional" in the arguments description." and goes on to describe
another notation for the arguments that are listed as optional.  But it 
say anything about arguments given in [...] and NOT also listed as optional.

I don't know if we are doing bug fixes yet on F95, but shouldn't we change the
argument description for MAX and MIN to

Arguments.
A1, A2     shall both have the same type which shall be integer or real
           and they shall all have the same type parameter.

A3,... (optional)  shall have the same type and type parameter as A1

It's clear what we meant to do, did I miss something simple somewhere?

Its not quite so clear to me.  You may have missed something subtle.
Some intrinsics have multiple interfaces and there are subtle but
critical differences between an argument that is optional as opposed
to an argument that is omitted from one or more of the interfaces.

What isn't clear is which of these categories MIN and MAX fit into.
Is it one interface with an infinite number of optional arguments or
is it an infinite number of interfaces, each with a different number
of required arguments?

MIN and MAX are rather "special" in any case in that it is impossible
to write an interface for them (in a finite number of lines of code).
I'm not entirely sure that they fit in either category.

I'm not sure of the correct answer here - all I'm saying is that it
isn't as simple a case as it sounds at first glance.  You can actually
change what is or isn't legal depending on exactly how you describe
MIN and MAX (consider the restrictions in 12.4.1.5).  It may be an
error in f95, but I'd treat it as a "real" question, not as a typo.

It's also not clear to me, but, as I read the MAX/MIN description
in Fortran 90 I'd say that A3,... are each optional arguments; not
that the description is a shorthand for an infinite number of lists.
If this is correct then upwards compatability demands (well suggests anyhow)
that A3, A4, ... are each optional and this leads to the surprising result
that  MAX(A1=1,A2=2,  A4=4  ) is legal.

I guess I agree with that, unless someone has an obvious answer.

I think there might have been an interp related to that, but too many hot
non-J3 things right now for me to take the time to search the interps.

[ Added note from Larry:  This time I could not find the interp that Richard
  maybe remembers.  At least nothing showed up when I searched both the A and
  B categories using A4 and MAX. ]
