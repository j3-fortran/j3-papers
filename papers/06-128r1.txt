         of optional, assumed-shape, allocatable, and pointer

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Summary:
--------
  
Provide extensions to C Interop that allow for interoperable Fortran
procedures that have data pointer, allocatable, assumed-shape array, or
optional dummy arguments.

Note: In addition to the suggestions from meeting 174, an argument
{{elem_size}} has been added to the FDesc_*_Get functions.

Specification and Syntax: 
-------------------------

A Fortran procedure interface with the BIND(C) attribute that has
assumed-shape, allocatable, or data pointer dummy arguments, is
interoperable with a C function prototype where the corresponding formal
parameter has type {{FDesc_Assumed_t}}, {{FDesc_Alloc_t}} or
{{FDesc_Pointer_t}}, respectively. That is to say, a C function calling a
Fortran procedure with the BIND(C) attribute will pass a descriptor handle
as the actual argument corresponding to an assumed-shape, allocatable, or
data pointer dummy argument.  Such an argument must have interoperable type
and type parameters. The value {{FDESC_NULL}} is provided to represent
(uninitialized) null descriptor handles. Depending on the details of the
processor's Fortran descriptors, the procedure may be required to merge
additional information into the descriptor based on the declaration of the
dummy argument, or to create a local representation based on the
information in the descriptor.  If the dummy argument is deallocated,
allocated, or has its pointer association status changed in the procedure,
the descriptor shall be modified to reflect the new state of the argument
on return from the Fortran procedure.

Note to implementors. It is expected that a processor implementation will
typedef a descriptor handle as a pointer to a descriptor.

A procedure interface that has OPTIONAL dummy arguments can have the
BIND(C) attribute and be interoperable. The VALUE attribute is not allowed
for optional dummy arguments in a BIND(C) interface. The interoperable C
prototype is the same as if the OPTIONAL attribute were not present, the
only difference is the function reference on the C side. Namely, a C caller
specifies a missing actual argument in a function reference by passing a
null data pointer as the argument value if the corresponding dummy argument
is a data object, or a null procedure pointer as the argument value if the
corresponding dummy argument is a procedure. If the dummy is an optional
assumed-shape, allocatable, or pointer dummy argument, the C caller can use
{{FDESC_NULL}} as an actual argument. A Fortran procedure, as usual, omits
the actual argument in the procedure reference.

______________

Add section "15.5 Interoperability of Assumed-Shape, Pointer and
Allocatable Dummy Arguments"

Fortran assumed-shape arrays, array pointers, and allocatable arrays, are
not interoperable with C arrays.  Companion processors reference
interoperable Fortran procedures that have assumed-shape, data pointer, or
allocatable dummy arguments, by using opaque descriptor handles (15.5.1.1).
For regularity, scalar data pointer and allocatable dummy arguments
are included and treated as arrays of rank zero. Section 15.5.1 defines a
header file with types, constants, and function prototypes, used to
access and modify descriptor fields.

In a function reference in C, the actual argument corresponding to an
assumed-shape, pointer, or allocatable dummy argument shall be a descriptor
handle describing an array of the appropriate rank and type.  The
descriptor handle shall not be {{FDESC_NULL}} unless the dummy argument is
OPTIONAL (15.6). For allocatable or pointer dummy arguments, the descriptor
handle reflects changes in the allocation or pointer association status
upon return from the procedure.

If a Fortran procedure reference causes a procedure defined by means other
than Fortran to be called, the Fortran processor supplies an appropriate
descriptor as the actual argument corresponding to an assumed-shape,
allocatable, or data pointer dummy argument. That procedure shall not
modify an assumed-shape descriptor, and shall modify a pointer or
allocatable descriptor only by using the functions described in 15.5.2.3,
15.5.2.4 and 15.5.2.5.

______________

Note 15.25

A procedure that has an assumed-shape, pointer, or allocatable dummy
argument may be defined by means other than Fortran, and referenced from
Fortran programs. The processor constructs the appropriate descriptors for
the actual arguments.  However, such procedures shall obey the semantics of
Fortran programs.  For example, assumed-shape array descriptors shall not
be modified, Fortran restrictions on dummy arguments shall be obeyed, etc.

______________

Note 15.26

For example, a Fortran procedure with the interface
   
   SUBROUTINE MY_MATMUL(A,B,C) BIND(C,NAME="MatMul") 
      ! Perform the matrix operation C=A*B
      USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_C_BINDING
      REAL(C_DOUBLE), DIMENSION(:,:), INTENT(IN)  :: A, B
      REAL(C_DOUBLE), DIMENSION(:,:), INTENT(OUT) :: C
      C = MATMUL(A,B)
   END SUBROUTINE
   
may be called from a C program as follows:

{{
   #include <iso_fortran_desc.h>

   /* The interoperable prototype */
   void MatMul(FDesc_Assumed_t, FDesc_Assumed_t, FDesc_Assumed_t);

   int err;
   double A[100][100], B[100][100], C[100][100];

   /* The opaque descriptor handles */
   FDesc_Assumed_t A_desc, B_desc, C_desc;

   F_extent_t shape[2] = {100,100};
   F_stride_t stride[2] = {sizeof(double),100*sizeof(double)};

   /* Create the descriptors (error return values are ignored) */
   err = FDesc_Assumed_Create(&A_desc, sizeof(double), 2);
   err = FDesc_Assumed_Create(&B_desc, sizeof(double), 2);
   err = FDesc_Assumed_Create(&C_desc, sizeof(double), 2);

   /* Initialize the descriptors (error return values are ignored) */
   err = FDesc_Assumed_Set(A_desc, A, shape, stride);
   err = FDesc_Assumed_Set(B_desc, B, shape, stride);
   err = FDesc_Assumed_Set(C_desc, C, shape, stride);

   /* Assign initial values to A, B */
      .
      .
      .

   MatMul(A_desc, B_desc, C_desc); /* Perform C=A*B for 100x100 arrays */

   /* Destroy the descriptors (error return values are ignored) */
   err = FDesc_Assumed_Destroy(&A_desc);
   err = FDesc_Assumed_Destroy(&B_desc);
   err = FDesc_Assumed_Destroy(&C_desc);
}}

15.5.1 Opaque types and values defined in <iso_fortran_desc.h>

The standard specifies structure definitions and interfaces that the
processor shall provide in the header file, <iso_fortran_desc.h>, written
in the C programming language.  This file declares C prototypes (and
defines associated types) for the functions described in 15.5.2.  These
functions may be used to access and modify Fortran descriptors in C.


15.5.1.1 Descriptor handles

Fields or elements of array descriptors are made accessible to C via
descriptor handles. A scalar C object of type {{FDesc_Assumed_t}} is an
<<assumed-shape descriptor handle>>; other descriptor handles are
{{FDesc_Pointer_t}}, a <<pointer descriptor handle>> and {{FDesc_Alloc_t}},
an <<allocatable descriptor handle>>. Descriptor handles may be used in C
programs to access or modify fields in descriptors for assumed-shape array,
data pointer, or allocatable dummy arguments of interoperable Fortran
procedures.

The header file <iso_fortran_desc.h> also defines a constant {{FDESC_NULL}}
that is the value of a <<null descriptor handle>>. This constant may be
assigned to a descriptor handle. {{FDESC_NULL}} is the value assigned to a
descriptor handle if an error occurs in a descriptor create (15.5.2.1) as
well as the value that may be used to indicate that an actual argument is
not present (15.6).

15.5.1.2 Stride and extent types

The header file <iso_fortran_desc.h> defines two new integer types,
{{F_stride_t}}, used for array stride information, and {{F_extent_t}}, used
for array shapes and extents.

15.5.2 Function prototypes

Functions described in this section may be used to access and modify fields
in a Fortran descriptor; accesses to descriptors are made via handles.
Functions are provided to both create (15.5.2.1) and destroy (15.5.2.2)
descriptors, though these functions shall not be used if a descriptor
originates by call from Fortran.  Once a descriptor is created, the rank
and type of the descriptor shall not be changed.  Before using a descriptor
as an actual argument in a reference to an interoperable Fortran procedure,
the descriptor shall be initialized using the appropriate function in
15.5.2.3.  Storage for the array may be allocated by the Fortran processor
using the functions in 15.5.2.4, and deallocated by those in
15.5.2.5. Inquiry functions for descriptors are provided in 15.5.2.6,
15.5.2.7, 15.5.2.8 and 15.5.2.9.

If the descriptor handle is used as an actual argument in a reference to
an interoperable Fortran procedure, the corresponding dummy argument
shall have the same type and rank as the type and rank of the object
described by the descriptor.

15.5.2.1 Descriptor creation

   <<Prototypes.>>

     {{int FDesc_Assumed_Create
                (
                 FDesc_Assumed_t * restrict fdesc,
                 size_t elem_size,
                 unsigned int rank
                );}}

   <<Description.>>  Creates an assumed-shape descriptor. The descriptor
   shall be destroyed by a subsequent call to {{FDesc_Assumed_Destroy}}.

     {{int FDesc_Pointer_Create
                (
                 FDesc_Pointer_t * restrict fdesc,
                 size_t elem_size,
                 unsigned int rank
                );}}

   <<Description.>>  Creates a pointer descriptor and sets the initial
   pointer association status to disassociated. The descriptor shall be
   destroyed by a subsequent call to {{FDesc_Pointer_Destroy}}.

     {{int FDesc_Alloc_Create
                (
                 FDesc_Alloc_t * restrict fdesc,
                 size_t elem_size,

                );}}

   <<Description.>>  Creates an allocatable descriptor and sets the
   initial allocation status to not allocated. The descriptor shall be
   destroyed by a subsequent call to {{FDesc_Alloc_Destroy}}.
    
   <<Arguments.>>

     {{fdesc}}     shall be a pointer to a handle of a descriptor of the
                   specified type.  Upon return its value is the address of
                   the created handle.

     {{elem_size}} shall be the size of a scalar of the type of an array
                   element in bytes.

     {{rank}}      shall be the rank of the object.

   <<Result Value.>>

   The result value is 0 if successful or nonzero if an error occurs.

[Add Note]
The C type must be interoperable. The C sizeof operator (6.5.3.4)
can be used to obtain the appropriate value of {{elem_size}}.
[End Note]

15.5.2.3 Descriptor Modification

   <<Prototypes.>>

     {{int FDesc_Assumed_Set
                (
                 FDesc_Assumed_t fdesc,
                 void * restrict base_addr,
                 const F_extent_t shape[restrict],
                 const F_stride_t stride[restrict]
                );}}

   <<Description.>>  Sets the fields of an assumed-shape descriptor.
   The value of {{base_addr}} shall not be {{NULL}}.

                 const F_extent_t lbound[restrict],
                 const F_stride_t stride[restrict]
                );}}

   <<Description.>>  Sets the fields of a pointer descriptor.  If
   {{base_addr}} is {{NULL}}, the pointer association status is
   disassociated and {{shape}}, {{lbound}} and {{stride}} are ignored.

   <<Arguments.>>

     {{fdesc}}      shall be a handle to a descriptor of the specified type.

     {{base_addr}}  shall be a pointer to an object.

     {{shape}}      shall be an array whose element values are the shape of
                    the object.  Its size shall be at least {{rank}}
                    elements.  If {{base_addr}} is {{NULL}}, the {{shape}}
                    array is ignored.  The <i>th element corresponds to the
                    extent of the <i>th dimension of the corresponding
                    Fortran object.

     {{lbound}}     shall be an array whose element values are the lower
                    bounds of the object, in elements.  Its size shall be
                    at least {{rank}} elements.  If {{base_addr}} is
                    {{NULL}}, the {{lbound}} array is ignored.

     {{stride}}     shall be an array whose element values are the distance
                    in bytes between successive elements for each dimension.
                    Its size shall be at least {{rank}} elements.  If
                    {{base_addr}} is {{NULL}}, the {{stride}} array is
                    ignored.

   <<Result Value.>>

   The result value shall be 0 if successful or nonzero if an error
   occurs.

[Add Note]
The ordering of corresponding indices is reversed between Fortran and C
arrays (15.2.5). The {{shape}} argument is in Fortran order.  For example,
if one wanted to create a descriptor for the C array declared as

   {{double array[10][5];}}

the appropriate {{shape}} would be {{shape={5,10}}}.

     {{lbound}}     shall be an array; it contains the lower bounds of object
                    on return.  Its size shall be at least {{rank}} elements.

     {{stride}}     shall be an array; it contains the distance in bytes
                    between successive elements for each dimension on
                    return.  Its size shall be at least {{rank}} elements.

   <<Result Value.>>

   The result value is 0 if successful or nonzero if an error occurs.

Add section "15.6 Interoperability of Optional Dummy Arguments"

An interoperable Fortran procedure can have OPTIONAL dummy arguments. The
VALUE attribute shall not be combined with the OPTIONAL attribute. If such
a procedure is referenced in C and the actual argument corresponding to
that dummy argument is

   a) a null pointer, and the dummy argument is interoperable; or

   b) a null descriptor handle, and the dummy argument is an
      assumed-shape array, allocatable variable, or data pointer;

then the dummy argument is not present (12.4.1.6), otherwise, it is
present.

If a Fortran procedure reference causes a procedure defined by means
other than Fortran to be called, the Fortran processor will supply {{NULL}}
for a nonpresent actual argument corresponding to an interoperable dummy
argument, or {{FDESC_NULL}} for a nonpresent actual argument corresponding
to an assumed-shape, allocatable, or data pointer dummy argument.
