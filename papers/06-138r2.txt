This paper describes the specification, syntax, and edits for WG5 work item
J3-002.

Specification:
Provide the programmer the ability to get an available unit number and OPEN
an external (or scratch) file, without having to worry about selecting a valid
and available I/O unit number.  This capability is expected to work in the
presence of parallel (e.g. OpenMP) execution, and should not interfere with
any existing UNIT number usage in existing code.

Syntax and intended semantics:
Add the following keywords to the OPEN statement: NEWUNIT=variable

When the NEWUNIT specifier is present, the processor will attempt to OPEN the
specified file, with a currently unused negative unit number, and, if the OPEN
is successful, will assign that negative unit number to variable.  The unit
number selected shall be negative, and will not conflict with any positive unit
number, any negative unit number used for uddtio child unit number, error codes
(INQUIRE), nor the * units.

If the OPEN is not successful, variable shall not be defined by the OPEN
statement.

When the NEWUNIT specifier is present,  file-unit-number shall not be present. 

When the NEWUNIT specifier is present, either the FILE= specifier shall be
present, or STATUS= with a value of SCRATCH shall be present.

Allow INQUIRE on internal units, and return a new IOSTAT value for an internal
file.  Needed because negative unit numbers are now used for both child data
statements (which may be internal units), and processor assigned external unit #s.


Edits:
  [178:17-18] Replace "a file positioning statement, or a file inquiry statement"
  with "or a file positioning statement"

[178:30-32]  Replace
  "<file-unit-number> whose value is nonnegative or equal to one of the named
  constants INPUT_UNIT, OUTPUT_UNIT, or ERROR_UNIT of the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
  module (13.8.2). "
with
  "<file-unit-number>.  The value of <file-unit-number> shall be nonnegative, 
  one of the named constants that identify unit numbers in the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
  module (INPUT_UNIT, OUTPUT_UNIT, or ERROR_UNIT) (13.8.2), or a NEWUNIT
  value (9.4.5.10)"

[181:33+] Insert
  "<<or>> NEWUNIT = <scalar-int-variable>"

[181:43] Replace "A" with:
  "If the NEWUNIT= specifier does not appear, a"

[181:44+] Insert two new constraints:
  "(Cxxx)  R(905) If a NEWUNIT= specifier appears, a <file-unit-number> shall
                  not appear.

[182:3+] Insert a new paragraph
  "If the NEWUNIT= specifier appears in an OPEN statement, either the
   FILE= specifier shall appear, or the STATUS= specifier shall appear
   with a value of SCRATCH.  The unit identified by a NEWUNIT value shall not
   be preconnected."


[183:32+] Insert a new paragraph and renumber all subsequent OPEN statement
          specifier paragraphs:
  "<<9.4.5.10  NEWUNIT= specifier in the OPEN statement>>
  The <scalar-int-variable> is defined with a processor determined NEWUNIT
  value if no error occurs during the execution of the OPEN statement.  If an
  error occurs, the processor shall not change the value of
  <scalar-int-variable>.  

  A NEWUNIT value is a negative number, and shall not be -1, ERROR_UNIT,
  INPUT_UNIT, OUTPUT_UNIT, any value used by the processor for the unit argument
  to a user-defined derived type input/output procedure, nor any value used to
  OPEN a file that is currently OPEN."

[201:12] Replace Note 9.44 with:
  "<<NOTE 9.44>>
  The <unit> argument passed to a user defined derived type input/output procedure
  will be negative when the parent I/O statement identified an internal unit, or
  the parent’s unit value was a processor determined NEWUNIT value.   When a unit
  that identifes an internal unit is used with the INQUIRE statement, an error
  condition will occur, and the IOSTAT specifier’s <scalar-int-variable> will be
  assigned the value IOSTAT_INQUIRE_INTERNAL_UNIT from the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
  intrinsic module (13.8.2).  When an internal unit is used with an INQUIRE
  statement that contains neither an IOSTAT= specifier nor an ERR= specifier,
  execution of the program is terminated.
  (end note)"

[211:8-9] Replace these lines with
  "If <file-unit-number> identifies an internal unit (9.5.3.7.2), an error
  condition occurs."  

[218:25+] add a list item, and renumber the rest of the list:
  "(2) The processor-dependent positive integer value of the constant
  IOSTAT_INQUIRE_INTERNAL_UNIT if an error occurred due to a unit number
  identifying an internal file being used in an INQUIRE statement."

[218:26] Replace "an error" with "any other error"

[360:26+] Insert
  "<<13.8.2.7  IOSTAT_INQUIRE_INTERNAL_UNIT>>
  The value of the default integer scalar constant IOSTAT_INQUIRE_INTERNAL_UNIT
  is assigned to the variable specified in an IOSTAT= specifier in an INQUIRE
  statement (9.9.1) if a <file-unit-number> identifies an internal unit in an
  INQUIRE statement.  

  <<NOTE x.x>>
  This can only occur when a user defined derived type input/output procedure is
  called by the processor as the result of  executing a parent data transfer
  statement for an internal unit.   
  (end note)"

Note to editor, please add a note on page xiii:
    xx) OPEN statement enhancements that allow the processor to select a
        ‘safe’ unit number when opening an external unit.  Such a unit number
	is guaranteed not to interfere with any program managed unit numbers.
