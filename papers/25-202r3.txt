1. Background
-------------
The current Fortran 202Y work list WG5/N2249 includes asynchronous
collective subroutines as accepted work item US04 and execution of
collective procedures on a specified team as accepted work item DIN1.

Paper 25-162r2 "US04: Requirements for Asynchronous Collective
Subroutines" presents an illustrative use case and a list of requirements.
It passed at the Oct 2025 J3 meeting #237.

Paper 25-165r1 "US04: Specifications for Asynchronous Collective
Subroutines" presents the specifications and semantics for the new
asynchronous collective subroutines feature. It passed at the Oct 2025 J3
meeting #237.

Paper 25-127r1 "DIN1: Collectives over a specified team,
req/spec/syntax/edits" (passed at Jun 2025 J3 meeting #236), adds a new
TEAM argument to the same collective subroutines impacted by work item
US04.  The functionality of these two features (US04 and DIN1) is entirely
orthogonal, but their effects must be merged in the final syntax.

Paper 25-166r2 "US04: Syntax for Asynchronous Collective Subroutines"
presents the syntax for the asynchronous collective subroutines feature
and incorporates the syntactic changes from work item DIN1. It passed at
the Oct 2025 J3 meeting #237

This paper presents the combined edits for work items US04 and DIN1,
and supersedes the edits previously passed in section 5 of 25-127r1.

2. Edits Relative to 25-007r1
=============================

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
[xv] Add to "Intrinsic procedures" the sentences:

"A new TEAM argument has been added to the collective subroutines, enabling
execution of a collective subroutine on a specified team. A new COMPLETION
argument has been added to the collective subroutines; along with the new
COMPLETE intrinsic, this enables explicitly asynchronous execution of
collective subroutines.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
3 Terms and definitions:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
16.6 Collective subroutines:

[380:26] paragraph 1:
 replace "the current team" with "the specified team"

[380:28] paragraph 1:
 replace "its current team" with "the specified team"

[380:30-] after paragraph 1:
 Insert new paragraph reading:

"The team specified by an invocation of a collective subroutine is
 the current team if the TEAM argument does not appear in that
 invocation. Otherwise, it is the team identified by the value of
 the TEAM argument. On all images participating in the same collective
 computation, the specified team shall be the same team; either the
 initial team, or a team created by corresponding executions of the same
 FORM TEAM statement (11.7.9) with the same value for \si{team-number}."

[380:32] paragraph 2:
  replace "of a team" with "of the specified team".

[381:2,7,13,15] paragraph 3, paragraph 4 bullet 4, paragraph 6 (twice):
 replace "the current team" with "the specified team".

[381:3-] after paragraph 3:
 Insert new paragraphs reading:

"
If the COMPLETION argument appears in a reference to a collective
subroutine, the reference initiates an asynchronous collective operation.
This collective operation proceeds as an asynchronous input communication
(18.10.4) and is associated with COMPLETION. The completion count of
COMPLETION is incremented by one before the initiation call returns, and
decremented by one after the collective operation finishes its computation
with respect to the current image. The decrement occurs even if an error
condition occurs. The decrement may occur before the initiation call
returns.

An asynchronous collective operation is outstanding on a given image during
the period between subroutine invocation and when the completion count of
COMPLETION next reaches zero. The A argument, and the STAT and ERRMSG
arguments if present, are pending communication affectors (18.10.4) while
the asynchronous collective operation remains outstanding.

C1602a  If the COMPLETION argument appears in a reference to a collective
        subroutine, then the A argument, and the STAT and ERRMSG arguments
        if present, shall have the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute.

NOTE
A completion variable decrement on one image does not imply that other
images participating in the same asynchronous collective operation have
finished their computation.
"

[381:19+] append to paragraph 7:

"If the COMPLETION argument appears in the initiation call, this error
 termination is initiated while the asynchronous communication is
 outstanding; the error termination need not occur during the initiation
 call or a completion call to the COMPLETE subroutine."

[412:14-] In 16.9 Specifications of the standard intrinsic procedures,
before the specification of CONJG, insert new section:

"
16.9.59a COMPLETE( COMPLETION [, FINISHED ])

<<Description.>> Wait for or query a completion variable.

<<Class.>> Subroutine.

<<Arguments.>>

COMPLETION shall be a noncoindexed variable of type COMPLETION_TYPE from
           the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV. It is an INTENT (INOUT)
           argument.

FINISHED (optional) when present, shall be a variable of logical type with
                    the same shape as COMPLETION. It is an INTENT (OUT)
                    argument.

The effect of calling COMPLETE depends on the presence of the FINISHED
argument:

<Case (i):>   CALL COMPLETE(COMPLETION) causes the executing image to wait
              until the count of every completion variable in COMPLETION
              reaches zero.

<Case (ii):>  If FINISHED is present and scalar, then
              CALL COMPLETE(COMPLETION, FINISHED) causes FINISHED to be
              defined to the value true if the count of completion variable
              COMPLETION is zero, and false otherwise.

<Case (iii):> If FINISHED is present and an array, then
              CALL COMPLETE(COMPLETION, FINISHED) causes each element of
              FINISHED to be defined to the value true if the count of
              completion variable in the corresponding element of
              COMPLETION is zero, and false otherwise.

<<Example.>> This example demonstrates how to initiate several asynchronous
collective subroutines and overlap the latency of that communication with
other unrelated work. In the example, there is asynchronous input
communication; the variables X, Y and S are pending communication affectors
between the collective subroutine initiation call where they are passed as
arguments and the subsequent COMPLETE subroutine call that waits for the
associated completion variable C.

  SUBROUTINE simple_overlap
     use ISO_FORTRAN_ENV, ONLY: COMPLETION_TYPE
     INTEGER :: X, Y, S
     ... <Code that initializes X and Y>
     BLOCK
       TYPE(COMPLETION_TYPE) :: C
       ASYNCHRONOUS :: X, Y, S
       CALL CO_SUM(x, COMPLETION=C)   ! initiate asynchronous collectives
       CALL CO_MAX(y, COMPLETION=C, STAT=S)
       ! no references to X,Y,S permitted while collectives are outstanding
       CALL do_something_else
       CALL COMPLETE ( C ) ! await completion of both collectives
       PRINT *, X, Y, S
     END BLOCK
  END SUBROUTINE

NOTE
COMPLETE is not a collective subroutine. Execution of COMPLETE does not
imply any synchronization between images, and a reference to COMPLETE is
not an image control statement. Completion of an asynchronous collective
operation by one image does not imply completion of the same collective
operation by any other image.
"

------------------------------------------------------------------------
[493:14-] Insert a new section in 16.10.2 before CURRENT_TEAM:

"
16.10.2.7a COMPLETION_TYPE

COMPLETION_TYPE is a derived type with private components. It is an
extensible type with no type parameters. Each nonallocatable component is
fully default-initialized.

A scalar variable of type COMPLETION_TYPE is a completion variable.
A completion variable is a data abstraction for the completion status of
zero or more asynchronous operations. The completion variable abstraction
includes a completion count, which is a count of outstanding asynchronous
operations associated with this variable. A completion variable shall be
capable of representing at least 127 associated outstanding operations. The
initial value of the completion count of a completion variable is zero. A
completion variable shall not become undefined while its completion count
is non-zero.

C1602b A named entity with declared type COMPLETION_TYPE, or which has a
       potential subobject component with declared type COMPLETION_TYPE,
       shall be a variable. A component that is of such a type shall be a
       data component.

C1602c A completion variable shall not appear in a variable definition
       context except as an <allocate-object>, or as an actual argument in
       a reference to a procedure with an explicit interface if the
       corresponding dummy argument has INTENT (INOUT).

C1602d A variable with a nonpointer subobject of type COMPLETION_TYPE shall
       not appear in a variable definition context except as an
       <allocate-object> in an ALLOCATE statement without a SOURCE=
       specifier, as an <allocate-object> in a DEALLOCATE statement, or as
       an actual argument in a reference to a procedure with an explicit
       interface if the corresponding dummy argument has INTENT (INOUT).
