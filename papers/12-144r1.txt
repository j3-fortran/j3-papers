NUMBER: F08/0008
TITLE: IEEE exceptions for intrinsic functions
KEYWORDS: IEEE_INVALID, SQRT
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTIONS:

Section 13.7.1, page 325, lines 10-12 states

    If an infinite result is returned, the flag IEEE_OVERFLOW
    or IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO shall signal; if a NaN result is
    returned, the flag IEEE_INVALID shall signal.

Question (1):
The Fortran 2008 standard does not require a standard-conforming
processor to support IEEE_INVALID [14.3p8, 404:15].  If a
processor does not support IEEE_INVALID, is it required to signal
IEEE_INVALID when a NaN result is returned?

Question (2):
IEC 60559 requires the result of SQRT(+inf) to be +inf without
overflow being signaled.  IEC 60559 requires SQRT(qNaN), where qNaN
is a quiet NaN, not to signal an invalid operand exception.  Does
Fortran 2008 require SQRT(QNaN) to signal IEEE_INVALID?

ANSWERS:

A1. No, if the processor does not support IEEE_INVALID, it cannot
    signal IEEE_INVALID.  An edit is provided to clarify this.

A2. No, the standard does not specify the behavior of SQRT on qNaN.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[325:7] Change "is prohibited from invoking" to "shall not invoke".
{Simpler wording is easier to understand.}

[325:7-8] "returned in" -> "assigned to".
{Correct wording instead of nonsense.}

[325:8] After "or" insert "returned as a".
{Continue correcting grammar.}

[325:8-12] Replace "outside ... invoked" with
  "not representable by objects of the specified type and type
   parameters".

[325:12+] Insert new paragraph
  "If an IEEE infinity is assigned or returned, the intrinsic module
   IEEE_ARITHMETIC is accessible, and the actual arguments were finite
   numbers, the flag IEEE_OVERFLOW or IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO shall
   signal.   If an IEEE NaN is assigned or returned, the actual
   arguments were finite numbers, the intrinsic module IEEE_ARITHMETIC
   is accessible, and the exception IEEE_INVALID is supported, the
   flag IEEE_INVALID shall signal.  If no IEEE infinity or NaN is
   assigned or returned, these flags shall have the same status as
   when the intrinsic procedure was invoked."
