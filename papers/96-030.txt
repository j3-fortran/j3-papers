To: X3J3 and WG5
From: Richard Maine
Subject: Edits made to X3J3/95-007R2
Date:  January 29, 1996


Following changes have been made to X3J3/95-007r2.  The document with
these changes will eventually become X3J3/96-007, but I'll wait until
after the Feb X3J3 meeting in case further edits are added there.
The changes are, of course, subject to X3J3 and WG5 concurrence.

These changes are selected from email comments on the 95-007r2, plus
the defect processing ballot results.

All change bars in the new document were cleared before starting the
edits.  Thus the change bars in the new document reflect changes
relative to 95-007R2.

----------Misc fixes from email comments.

[xiii:42]  Replace 'and' by 'simultaneously and then'.

[xv:29] Delete comma.

[xv:30] ", in order to decrease" -> "; this decreases"

[14:17] "Statement function" -> "Statement function statement"

[27:29-40]  Merge notes 3.8 and 3.9 as follows.  Start with
                    An "!" or ";" in character position 6
       as in note 3.8.  Then use the rest of the text from 3.9,
       following "position 6".  Change "another" to "an".
       Result replaces the old 3.8.  Delete the old 3.9

[32:1] Delete "unsigned and".  No such term is defined.

[33:21-22] Replace 'underflow occurs ... below' by 'the exact result of
      an operation is negative but rounding produces a zero'.

[40:14] Delete hyphen from 'non-pointer'.

[49:1] "type-spec" -> "<type-spec>"

[51:27-31] Change the note to read

     An interface body may be specified for a dummy or external
     function whose result has a character length parameter value of *
     only if the function is not invoked.  This is because this
     characteristic has to be specified to be the same in the interface
     body as in the procedure definition, but in order to invoke such a
     procedure, the calling routine is required to specify a length
     other than *.

[54:2] "rank or the rank and shape are" -> "rank or shape is"

                                                                 X3J3/96-030
                                                                (Page 2 of 6)

[61:16] Change 'an' to 'a nonpointer'.

[83:28] Change 'PROCES' to 'PROCESS'.

[115:47] Capitalize the first word and add ',' at the end.
[115:48] Capitalize the first word and add ', and' at the end.
[116:1] Capitalize the first word and add '.' at the end.

[119:16] Replace '<index-name> variables' by '<forall-header> expressions'.

[129:6] Add period at end of line in constraint after R834.

[199:5] "shall" -> "shall not" in 4th constraint after R1215

[212:5-8] Capitalize the first word of each item.

[214:20] "simillar" -> "similar"

[245:31] "is absent or present with the value..."
         -> "is absent or has the value..."
         The original wording invited strange misreadings (which could
         alternatively be fixed by adding "is" before "present").  This
         fix also repairs a bad line break.

[253:31] 13.14.67 heading.  MAXLOC -> MAXVAL

[256:19 13.14.72 heading.  MAXLOC -> MINVAL

[260:27] 13.14.83 heading.  MAXLOC -> PRODUCT

[266:37-40] Replace all 4 lines by

  Case (iv): If B is of type real and is zero, then
         (a) If the processor cannot distinguish between positive and
             negative real zero, the value of the result is |A|.
         (a) If B is positive real zero, the value of the result is |A|.
         (b) If B is negative real zero, the value of the result is -|A|.

[268:37] 13.14.105 heading.  MAXLOC -> SUM

[273:30] "present with" -> "has"

[293:30] Delete hyphen from 'non-pointer'.

[305:30] Replace R504 by R512.
[305:31] Replace (10) by (11).

[305:45] "in" -> "In"

[310:22] "compoents" -> "components"

--------------Some global items from email comments.

Index.  Make font size for index entries 10 pt like the rest of the
    document instead of 12 pt.

                                                                 X3J3/96-030
                                                                (Page 3 of 6)

Change font for "FORTRAN 66" and "FORTRAN 77" to be consistently large "F"
    with "ORTRAN" in small capitals as in section 1.5.2 on pp 3-4.
    Changes are needed in the following lines:

    FORTRAN 66: 303:16, 303:20, 303:25, 303:27, 307:15

    FORTRAN 77: Contents at 1.5.2, 6:20, 6:24, 303:9, 303:13, 303:16, 303:20,
                303:21, 303:24, 307:15, index at "compatibility", index at
                "FORTRAN 77 compatibility".

    (The heading for section 1.5.2 is ok on page 3.  However, my attempts
    to get the font size change into the table of contents entry for this
    section on pg i failed.  The index entries were also tricky, but they
    worked).

interp 27

     1. In section 13.14.13, [232:19] in the description of the
        TARGET dummy argument add
          ". It shall have the same type, type parameters, and rank
              as POINTER"
        following
           "shall be a pointer or target"

     2.  Section 13.14.13, replace Case (ii) [232:25-27] and Case (iii)
         [232:28-30] with
         (Editor's note: I added commas after "otherwise" and "If POINTER
         is disassociated".  Also deleted "the" before "POINTER").


        "Case (ii):  If TARGET is present and is a scalar target, the
           result is true if TARGET is not a zero-sized storage
           sequence and the target associated with POINTER occupies
           the same storage units as TARGET.
           Otherwise, the result is false. If POINTER is
           disassociated, the result is false.

         Case (iii): If TARGET is present and is an array target, the result
           is true if the target associated with POINTER and TARGET
           have the same shape, are neither of size zero nor arrays whose
           elements are zero-sized storage sequences, and occupy the
           same storage units in array element order.  Otherwise,
           the result is false. If POINTER is disassociated, the
           result is false.

         Case (iv):  If TARGET is present and is a scalar pointer, the result
           is true if the target associated with POINTER and the

           is false.

         Case (v):   If TARGET is present and is an array pointer, the result
           is true if the target associated with POINTER and the

           neither of size zero nor arrays whose elements are zero-sized
           storage sequences, and occupy the same storage units in
           array element order.  Otherwise, the result is false.
           If either POINTER or TARGET is disassociated, the result
           is false. "

        paragraph [200:30-32]

     2. In section 12.4.1.1, add to the end of the 7th paragraph
        [200:45]
        "If such a dummy argument is associated with a dummy argument

     3. In section 12.4.1.2, 8th paragraph, [201:1]
        Change 'is either scalar or is an assumed-shape array'
            to 'is either a scalar or an assumed-shape array'

                                                                 X3J3/96-030

     5. In section C.9.5 [336:32]
   Change "and is scalar or assumed-shape"

interp 148

     (As mentioned in email, the following text reflects some editorial
     changes from the exact text of the interpretation).

     1. [262:15+] In Section 13.14.86, before "Examples", insert the
        following paragraph:

         "The pseudorandom number generator used by RANDOM_NUMBER
          maintains a seed that is updated during the execution of
          RANDOM_NUMBER and that may be specified or returned by
          RANDOM_SEED.  Computation of the seed from argument PUT
          is performed in a processor-dependent manner.
          The value returned by GET need not be the same as the value
          specified by PUT in an immediately preceding reference to
          RANDOM_SEED.  For example, following execution of the
          statements

               CALL RANDOM_SEED(PUT=SEED1)
               CALL RANDOM_SEED(GET=SEED2)

          SEED2 need not equal SEED1.  When the values differ, the use
          of either value as the PUT argument in a subsequent call to
          RANDOM_SEED shall result in the same sequence of pseudorandom
          numbers being generated.  For example, after execution of
          the statements

               CALL RANDOM_SEED(PUT=SEED1)
               CALL RANDOM_SEED(GET=SEED2)
               CALL RANDOM_NUMBER(X1)
               CALL RANDOM_SEED(PUT=SEED2)
               CALL RANDOM_NUMBER(X2)

          X2 equals X1."

                                                                 X3J3/96-030

      1. In section 13.14.95, the paragraph prefaced with

          change "if the precision is not available"
              to "if the processor does not support a real data type
                  with a precision greater than or equal to P"

      2. In section 13.14.95, the paragraph prefaced with
         "Result Value", [265:41]
         change "if the exponent range is not available"
             to "if the processor does not support a real data type
                 with an exponent range greater than or equal to R"

      3. In section 13.14.95, the paragraph prefaced with
         "Result Value", [265:41]
          change "if neither is available"
              to "if neither is supported"


interp 203
      (Note, deleted the comma from the second edit; it didn't belong)

      1. In section 14.4, 2nd sentence  [281:28],
          Add "that is not an extended intrinsic operator"
         after "A defined operator"

      2. In section 14.5, 2nd sentence [281:33],
          Add "or replace the intrinsic derived type assignment
               operation" after "operations"


----------- Final adjustments

After all the above edits were done, some adjustments around tables and
notes (which are implemented as Frame tables) were made to improve page
breaks.  The automatic page breaking doesn't deal well with tables, so
they often need to be hand-tuned.  None of these adjustments involved
any changes to text.  They do, however, generate change bars, so you
may notice a few unexpected change bars around tables and notes even
though there are no text changes.  Section 12 needed the most manual
adjustment, and section 13 needed a few cases; I don't recall any in
other sections, but I might have forgotten to record one.
