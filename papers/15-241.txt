Subject: Add missing commas
Date: 2015 October 12

There are some places in 15-007r2 where a comma is
missing.

Edit to 15-007r2:

{Should there be a comma after the word "specifier"
in this bullet item (e.g., should it read "a SIZE=
specifier,") ? }
[217:4]

{Add a comma after the word "otherwise".}
[221:22]

{Add a comma after the word "otherwise".}
[224:42]

{Add a comma after the word "Otherwise".}
[228:4]

{Add a command after "in this case"}
[240:8]

{Add a command after "In this case" in Note 9.60 on
page 240 first bullet, second sentence}
[240:9-11]

Suggested Text for [240:9-11]:
The INQUIRE statement could consider an asynchronous
data transfer to be incomplete until after the
corresponding wait operation. In this case, PENDING=
would always return true unless there were no previously
pending data transfers for the unit.
