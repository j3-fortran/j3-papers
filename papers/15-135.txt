Discussion
----------

In the recent ballot (see N2045) Malcolm Cohen wrote
"(b) The TS has merely scratched the surface of the semantics that are
being specified for stalled image handling; much more work needs to be
done to clarify what is supposed to happen (e.g. which variables become
undefined, etc.).  Even for failed images some additional work appears
to be needed..."

The edit here addresses the issue for failed images.

Edit to N2040:
---------------

[14:12+] Add "Any data object that might be defined or undefined by
execution of the segment in which the image fails becomes undefined."
