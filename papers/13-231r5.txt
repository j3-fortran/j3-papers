Subject:   Coarray teams
Date: 2013 February 15
Reference: WG5/N1883, WG5/N1930, 12-201

1. Discussion
-------------

This paper proposes syntax and semantics for coarray teams.

2. Requirements (copied from N1930)
-----------------------------------

Teams provide a capability to restrict the image set of remote memory
references, coarray allocations, and synchronizations to a subset of
all the images of the program. This simplifies writing programs that
involve segregated activities (parts of a climate model, for example)
that might be more easily be written independently or may have already
been written as independent programs. Teams also provide a mechanism
for subdividing the computation for the sake of better performance
(such as within local SMP domains). Finally, teams provide the
capability to execute procedures (such as library procedures) that use
coarrays internally on a subset of the images of a program.

T1: When a block of code is executed on images executing as a team, it
    should execute on those images as if the program contained no
    other images. This has the following implications:

    1. Image indices shall be relative to the team, starting at 1 and
       ending with the number of images in the team.

    2. Collective activities that would involve all images, such as
       SYNC ALL, allocation and deallocation of coarrays, collective
       subroutine execution, and inquiry intrinsics such as THIS_IMAGE
       and NUM_IMAGES shall be relative to the team.

T2: While an image executes a statement it shall be a member of one
    and only one team. Access to variables on images outside the
    current team is not permitted.

T3: It should be possible to split a team into mutually exclusive
    subsets that are themselves teams. This should be dynamic in order
    to allow different groupings of images during different stages of
    execution. It is desirable to have a compact mechanism for an
    image to specify which team it wishes to belong.

T4: There shall be a construct mechanism for changing the current
    team, involving the synchronization of all members of the teams
    at the beginning and end of the construct. The construct shall
    support separate execution blocks based on team membership. The
    construct shall make apparent (both to the system and the
    programmer) where team execution begins and ends.

T5: There shall be a type for variables identifying a team collection
    (probably an opaque derived type defined in the intrinsic module
    ISO_FORTRAN_ENV).

T6: There needs to be a mechanism to find the image index relative to
    the set of an ancestor team. This might best be done by adding an
    optional argument to IMAGE_INDEX that specifies the ancestor team.

T7: An allocatable coarray that is allocated within a team construct
    shall be deallocated before execution of the team construct
    terminates.  An coarray that was allocated in a parent team shall
    not be deallocated within an child team construct.

T8: The restriction that standard input is attached only to image 1 is
    unchanged, and the designated image is image 1 of the original set
    of images present at program startup.


3. Modifications to the requirements
------------------------------------

We have kept to the requirements except as follows

T4. We do not provide explicit syntax for separate execution blocks
based on team membership. This can easily be programmed with a SELECT
CASE construct specifying the subteam identifier, as is illustrated
in the example for the function SUBTEAM_ID (7.3.12).

T6. An extension of THIS_IMAGE is the natural way to achieve this aim.

T9. We have added facilities for the support of failed images. This
addition needs consideration by WG5.

T10. We have added a SYNC TEAM statement for efficient synchronization
of members of a team.  This addition needs consideration by WG5.


4. Syntax and Semantics
--------------------

The derived type TEAM_TYPE is defined in the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic
module. Its components are private. It is an extensible type with no
type parameters.

A scalar variable of type TEAM_TYPE is a team variable. It shall not
be a coarray or a subobject of a coarray.

Every image of the program begins execution as a member of the initial
team. At any point during execution of the program an image shall be a
member of one and only one team. That team is the current team. The
result of the NUM_IMAGES() intrinsic function is the number of images
in the current team. The image index values for images of the current
team are in the set 1..NUM_IMAGES(). No mechanism is provided to
access variables on images outside the current team.

A FORM SUBTEAM statement is provided to form a subteam.

The current team to which the execution image belongs is changed by
execution of a CHANGE TEAM construct.

The intrinsic function SUBTEAM_ID provides the value of the subteam
identifier in the execution of the FORM SUBTEAM statement that formed
the current team or an ancestor of the current team.

Team distance is a measure of the distance between two teams, one of
which is an ancestor of the other. The team distance between a team
and itself is zero. Except for the initial team, every team has a
unique parent team. The team distance between a team and its parent is
one. The team distance between a team T and the parent of team A which
is an ancestor of T is one more than the team distance between teams T
and A.

The intrinsic function TEAM_DEPTH provides the team distance between
the current team and the initial team.

The SYNC TEAM statement provides synchronization of the members of a
team. The statement shall be executed only on images that are members of
the specified team, and all such images shall execute the statement.

A new default integer named constant, STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, is defined in
the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module.  It shall have a nonzero value
that is different from the value of STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE, STAT_LOCKED,
STAT_LOCKED_OTHER_IMAGE, or STAT_UNLOCKED. The value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE
becomes the value of the variable in a STAT= specifier in an image
control statement, or STAT argument of a collective subroutine call,
if execution of the statement involves synchronization with, or
accessing a variable on an image of the current team that has
failed. A failed image is one for which references or definitions of
data fail when that data should be accessible, or the image fails to
respond as part of a collective activity.  A failed image remains
failed for the remainder of the program execution.  The conditions
that cause an image to fail are processor dependent, but usually are
associated with a hardware failure of the processor, memory system, or
interconnection network. If more than one nonzero status value is
valid for the execution of a statement, the status variable is defined
with the value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE if there is a failed image. The
variable is defined with the value STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE only if no other
status value is valid.

The intrinsic function FAILED_IMAGES() provides the values of the
image indices for the images in the current team that have failed.

The intrinsic function THIS_IMAGE() is extended to have an optional
argument DISTANCE. The DISTANCE argument shall be a scalar integer
with the value of the team distance between the current team and an
ancestor of the current team. The result value is the image index of
the executing image in that ancestor team. The intrinsic function
THIS_IMAGE(COARRAY [, DIM]) is not extended.

The intrinsic function NUM_IMAGES() is extended to have optional
arguments DISTANCE and FAILED. The DISTANCE argument shall be a scalar
integer with the value of the team distance between the current team
and an ancestor team of the current team. The result value is the
number of images in that team. If FAILED is absent, the total number
of images is returned. If FAILED is present with the value true, the
number of failed images is returned. If FAILED is present with the
value false, the total number of images that have not failed is
returned.

Access to the standard input unit is available only on the image
that has image index 1 in the initial team.

5. Teams of images

5.1 Introduction

A team of images is a set of images that access each other's data and
synchronize with each other. The current team is the team that
includes the executing image. All image indices are relative to the
current team and data on images outside this team are
inaccessible. Except by executing a SYNC TEAM statement,
synchronization is possible only with other images of the team.
Initially, the current team consists of all the images and this is
known as the initial team. A team is divided into subteams by
executing a FORM SUBTEAM statement. Each subteam is identified by an
integer value known as its subteam identifier.  Information about the
team to which the current image belongs can be determined by the
processor from values stored in its team variable.

Team distance is a measure of the distance between two teams, one of
which is an ancestor of the other. The team distance between a team
and itself is zero. Except for the initial team, every team has a
unique parent team. The team distance between a team and its parent is
one. The team distance between a team T and the parent of team A,
which is an ancestor of T, is one more than the team distance between
teams T and A.

Within the body of a CHANGE TEAM construct the current team is the
subteam specified by the CHANGE TEAM statement.


5.2 TEAM_TYPE

The derived type TEAM_TYPE is an extensible type with no type
parameters. Its components are private. A scalar of this type
describes a team that includes the executing image. TEAM_TYPE is
defined in the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.

A scalar variable of type TEAM_TYPE is a team variable. A team
variable shall not be a coarray or a subcomponent of a coarray.

5.3 CHANGE TEAM construct

The CHANGE TEAM construct changes the current team to which the
executing image belongs.

R501 <change-team-construct> <<is>> <change-team-stmt>
                                 <block>
                              <end-change-team-stmt>
R502 <change-team-stmt>      <<is>> [<team-construct-name>:] []
                              [] CHANGE TEAM (<team-variable> []
                              [] [,<sync-stat-list>])
R503 <end-change-team-stmt>  <<is>> END TEAM [<end-team-construct-name>]

R504 <team-variable>       <<is>> <scalar-variable>

C501 (R501) A branch within a CHANGE TEAM construct shall not have a branch
            target that is outside the construct.

C502 (R501) If the <change-team-stmt> of a <change-team-construct>
            specifies a <team-construct-name>, the corresponding
            <end-change-team-stmt> shall specify the same
            <team-construct-name>. If the <change-team-stmt> of a
            <change-team-construct> does not specify a
            <team-construct-name>, the corresponding
            <end-change-team-stmt> shall not specify a
            <team-construct-name>.

C505 (R504) A <team-variable> shall be a scalar of the type
            TEAM_TYPE defined in the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module.

The value of the <team-variable> shall have been formed by executing
a FORM SUBTEAM statement.  The team executing the <change-team-stmt>
shall be the team that formed the team variable value. The current
team for the statements of the change-team block is the subteam that
was specified for the executing image by the execution of a FORM
SUBTEAM statement.

An allocatable coarray that was allocated when execution of a
<change-team> construct began shall not be deallocated during the
execution of the construct. An allocatable coarray that is allocated
when execution of a <change-team> construct completes is deallocated
if it was not allocated when execution of the construct began.

Both the CHANGE TEAM and END TEAM statements are image control
statements. When a CHANGE TEAM statement is executed, there is an
implicit synchronization of all images of the current team. On each
image, execution of the segment following the statement is delayed
until all the other images have executed the same statement the same
number of times. When execution of a change-team block finishes, there
is an implicit synchronization of all images of the parent team. On
each image, execution of the segment following the END TEAM statement
is delayed until all the other images have executed the same block the
same number of times.

Note:
  The deallocation of an allocatable coarray that was not allocated at
  the beginning of a CHANGE TEAM construct, but was allocated at the
  end of the construct, occurs even for allocatable coarrays with the
  SAVE attribute.


5.4  FORM SUBTEAM statement

R505 <form-subteam-stmt>  <<is>>  FORM SUBTEAM ( <subteam-id>, []
                              [] <team-variable> [,<sync-stat-list>])

R506 <subteam-id>         <<is>>  <scalar-integer-expr>

The FORM SUBTEAM statement defines <team-variable> for a subteam. The
value of <subteam_id> specifies the subteam to which the executing image
belongs. The value of <subteam-id> shall be greater than zero and is the
same for all images that are members of the same subteam.

The team variable shall not have the value of a team variable for an
ancestor of the current team.

Note:
   Executing the statement

      FORM SUBTEAM ( 2-MOD(ME,2), ODD_EVEN )

   with ME an integer with value THIS_IMAGE() and ODD_EVEN of type
   TEAM_TYPE, divides the current team into two subteams according to
   whether the image index is even or odd.


5.5 SYNC TEAM statement

R507 <sync-team-stmt> <<is>> SYNC TEAM (<team-variable>, []
                                       [] [,<sync-stat-list>])

Execution of a SYNC TEAM statement performs a synchronization of the
images of the team specified by the <team-variable>. Execution on an
image, M, of the segment following the SYNC TEAM statement is delayed
until each other image of the specified team has executed a SYNC TEAM
statement specifying the same team as many times as has image M. The
segments that executed before the SYNC TEAM statement on an image
precede the segments that execute after the SYNC TEAM statement on
another image.

NOTE:

  A SYNC TEAM statement performs a synchronization of images of a
  particular team whereas a SYNC ALL statement performs a
  synchronization of all images of the current team.


5.6 STAT_FAILED_IMAGE

The value of the default integer scalar constant STAT_FAILED_IMAGE is
different from the value of STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE, STAT_LOCKED,
STAT_LOCKED_OTHER_IMAGE, or STAT_UNLOCKED. Its value is assigned to
the variable specified in a STAT=specifier in an execution of an image
control statement, or the STAT argument in an invocation of a
collective procedure, if execution of the statement involves
synchronization with an image of the current team that has failed or
accessing a variable on an image of the current team that has failed.
A failed image is one for which references or definitions of variables
fail when that variable should be accessible, or the image fails to
respond as part of a collective activity. A failed image remains
failed for the remainder of the program execution.  If more than one
nonzero status value is valid for the execution of a statement, the
status variable is defined with the value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE if there
is a failed image. The variable is defined with the value
STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE only if no other status value is valid. The
conditions that cause an image to fail are processor dependent.


   NOTE 5.1
   A failed image is usually associated with a hardware failure
   of the processor, memory system, or interconnection network.


------------------------------------
[13:1] Change "New intrinsic" to "Intrinsic".

------------------------------------
[13:3-5] Change "subroutines" to "procedures" twice and add these
names to the list of intrinsics: SUBTEAM_ID, FAILED_IMAGES,
TEAM_DEPTH.

------------------------------------
[13:7+] Add a new paragraph to 7.1 General:

"The intrinsic procedures THIS_IMAGE and NUM_IMAGES described in
clause 13 of ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010 are extended as described in 7.4."

------------------------------------
[13:16+] Add


"All the collective subroutines have the optional arguments STAT and
ERRMSG.

If the STAT argument is present, successful invocation of a collective
subroutine causes the argument to become defined with the value zero.

If the STAT argument is present in an invocation of a collective
subroutine and its execution is not successful, the argument becomes
defined with a nonzero value and the effect is otherwise the same as
that of executing the SYNC MEMORY statement. If execution involves
synchronization with an image that has failed, the argument becomes
defined with the value of STAT_FAILED_IMAGE in the intrinsic module
ISO FORTRAN_ENV (13.8.2); otherwise, if no image of the current team
has stopped, the variable becomes defined with a processor-dependent
positive value that is different from the value of STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE
or STAT_FAILED_IMAGE in the intrinsic module ISO FORTRAN_ENV
(13.8.2). If an image had stopped, but no other error condition
occurred, the variable becomes defined with the value of the constant
STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE.

If an ERRMSG argument is present in an invocation of a collective
subroutine and an error condition occurs during its execution,
the processor shall assign an explanatory message to the argument.
If no such condition occurs, the processor shall not change the value of
the argument."

------------------------------------

[15-17] For each of the collective subroutines, add at the end of the
argument list "[,STAT ,ERRMSG]" and add to the argument descriptions

"STAT(optional)  shall be a scalar integer. It is an INTENT(OUT) argument.


ERRMSG(optional) shall be a scalar of type default character. It is an
     INTENT(INOUT) argument."

and add this paragraph before the example para:

"The effect of the presence of the optional arguments STAT and ERRMSG
is described in 7.2."

------------------------------------
[13:17] Change "subroutines" to "procedures".

------------------------------------
[17:44+] Add

7.3.11 FAILED_IMAGES ([KIND])

Description. Indices of failed images.

Class. Transformational function.

Argument.

KIND (optional) shall be a scalar integer constant expression. Its
value shall be the value of a kind type parameter for the type
INTEGER. The range for integers of this kind shall be at least as
large as for default integer.

Result Characteristics. Integer. If KIND is present, the kind type
parameter is that specified by the value of KIND; otherwise, the kind
type parameter is that of default integer type. The result is an array
of rank one whose size is equal to the number of failed images.

Result. The elements of the result are the values of the image indices
of the failed images in the current team, in numerically increasing
order.

Examples. If image 3 is the only failed image in the current team,
FAILED_IMAGES() has the value [3]. If there are no failed images in
the current team, FAILED_IMAGES() is a zero-sized array.


7.3.12 SUBTEAM_ID ([DISTANCE])

Description. Subteam identifier.

Class. Transformational function.

Argument. DISTANCE (optional) shall be a scalar nonnegative
integer.

Result Characteristics. Default integer scalar.

Result Value. If DISTANCE is not present, the result value is the
subteam identifier of the invoking image in the current team.  If
DISTANCE is present with a value less than or equal to the team
distance between the current team and the initial team, the result has
the value of the subteam identifier that the invoking image had when
it was a member of the team with a team distance of DISTANCE from the
current team.  Otherwise, the result has the value 1.

Example. The following code illustrates the use of SUBTEAM_ID to
control which code is executed.

TYPE(TEAM_TYPE) :: ODD_EVEN
    :
ME = THIS_IMAGE()
FORM SUBTEAM ( 2-MOD(ME,2), ODD_EVEN )
CHANGE TEAM (ODD_EVEN)
  SELECT CASE (SUBTEAM_ID())
  CASE (1)
     :  ! Code for odd images in parent team
  CASE (2)
     :  ! Code for even images in parent team
  END SELECT
END TEAM


7.3.13 TEAM_DEPTH()

Description. Team depth for the current team.

Class. Transformational function.

Arguments. None.

Results characteristics. Scalar default integer.

Result value. The result of TEAM_DEPTH is an integer with a value
equal to the team distance between the current team and the initial
team.

Example.

PROGRAM TD
   USE ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
   INTEGER         :: I_TEAM_DEPTH
   TYPE(TEAM_TYPE) :: SUBTEAM

   FORM SUBTEAMS(1, SUBTEAM)
   CHANGE TEAM(SUBTEAM)
     I_TEAM_DEPTH = TEAM_DEPTH()
   END TEAM
END

On completion of the CHANGE TEAM construct, I_TEAM_DEPTH has the value
1.


------------------------------------
[17:44++] At the end of clause 7 add a new subclause:

7.4 Modified intrinsic procedures

7.4.1 NUM_IMAGES

The description of the intrinsic function NUM_IMAGES in ISO/IEC
1539-1:2010 is changed by adding two optional arguments DISTANCE
and FAILED and a modified result if either is present.

The DISTANCE argument shall be a nonnegative scalar integer. If
DISTANCE is not present the result value is the number of images
in the current team.

If DISTANCE is present with a value less than or equal to the team
distance between the current team and the initial team, the team
specified is the team of which the invoking image was a member with a
team distance of DISTANCE from the current team; otherwise, the team
specified is the initial team.

The FAILED argument shall be a scalar LOGICAL argument. Its value
determines whether the result is the number of failed images or the
number of nonfailed images. If DISTANCE is present, the result
applies to the team it specifies, otherwise the result applies to the
current team.  If FAILED is present with the value true, the result is
the number of failed images in the applicable team, otherwise the
result is the total number of nonfailed images in the applicable team.


7.4.2 THIS_IMAGE

The description of the intrinsic function THIS_IMAGE( ) in ISO/IEC
1539-1:2010 is changed by adding an optional argument DISTANCE
and a modified result if DISTANCE is present.

The DISTANCE argument shall be a scalar integer. It shall be
nonnegative. If DISTANCE is not present, the result value is the image
index of the invoking image in the current team.  If DISTANCE is
present with a value less than or equal to the team distance between
the current team and the initial team, the result has the value of the
image index in the team of which the invoking image was last a member
with a team distance of DISTANCE from the current team; otherwise, the
result has the value of the image index that the invoking image had in
the initial team.


------------------------------------
[19:9] Replace "Include clauses as needed" by

{In paragraph 1 of the Introduction}

After "informally known as Fortran 2008, plus the facilities defined
in ISO/IEC TS 29113:2012" add "and ISO/IEC TS 18508:2014".

{After paragraph 3 of the Introduction and after the paragraph added
by ISO/IEC TS 29113:2012, insert new paragraph}

ISO/IEC TS 18508 provides additional facilities for parallel programming:

o teams provide a capability to restrict the image set of remote memory
  references, coarray allocations, and synchronizations to a subset of
  all the images of the program;

o collective subroutines perform computations based on values on all
  the images, offering the possibility of efficient execution of
  reduction operations;

o atomic memory operations provide powerful low-level primitives for
  synchronization of activities among images;

o tagged events allow one-sided ordering of execution segments;

o features for the support of continued execution after one or more
  images have failed; and

o features to detect which images have failed.

   specified is the team of which invoking image was a member with a
   team distance of DISTANCE from the current team; otherwise, the
   team specified is the initial team.

   If DISTANCE is present, the result applies to the team it
   specifies, otherwise the result applies to the current team.  If
   FAILED is present with the value true, the result is the number of
   failed images in the applicable team, otherwise the result is the
   total number of nonfailed images in the applicable team.


{In 13.7.165 THIS_IMAGE ( ) or THIS_IMAGE (COARRAY [, DIM])}

In the title, change "THIS_IMAGE ( )" to "THIS_IMAGE ([DISTANCE])"

In paragraph 3 Arguments, add new final item

   "DISTANCE (optional) shall be a scalar integer. It shall
         be nonnegative. It shall not be a coarray."


In paragraph 5 Result Value, modify the first case to be

  If DISTANCE is not present the result value is the image index of
  the invoking image in the current team.  If DISTANCE is present with
  a value less than or equal to the team distance between the current
  team and the initial team, the result has the value of the image
  index in the team of which the invoking image was member with a team
  distance of DISTANCE from the current team; otherwise, the result
  has the value of the image index that the invoking image had in the
  initial team.


{In 13.8.2 The ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module}

Move the paragraph and Note of subclause 5.6 of this Technical
Specification to become subclause 13.8.2.21b of F2008.

Move the two paragraphs of subclause 5.2 of this Technical
Specification to become subclause 13.8.2.26 of F2008.


------------------------------------
[20:5+] In 8.4 Edits to Annex A, add a new processor dependency:

  "the conditions that cause an image to fail;"

------------------------------------
[21:3+] In Annex A, add a new subclause

"A.1 Clause 5 notes"

and renumber A.1 to A.2 and insert as the new A.1:

"Example: Compute fluxes over land, sea and ice in different
         teams based on surface properties.
         Assumption: Each image deals with areas containing
                     exactly one of the three surface types.
