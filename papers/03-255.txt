Subject:  Post Fortran 2003: Movable arrays

______________________________________ 
Summary
______________________________________

There is a need for providing a dynamic array within Fortran that has
far less storage overheads than allocatable or pointer arrays. This is
possible because often it is known that the array will be contiguous
and its size is either known or can be deduced from some other data
which is available. I will call these movable arrays, based on a
proposal I originally developed with John Reid, pasted almost literally in the 
Proposal section. 

Movable arrays are a mixture between assumed-size arrays and array pointers. 
They behave like assumed-size arrays in almost all contexts, but can be 
inside derived types and can change their address dynamically like pointers. 
Some will note similarities with Cray pointers.

IMO, movable arrays
should also provide the basis for interoperability with C arrays,
rather then the current system where untyped pointers are used for
everything having to do with C. This is in agreement with several
comments to the FCD draft (but it was then too late for such a big
change).

Motivation
______________________________________

Consider a data-structure representing a graph, where a vertex needs a list of 
neighbours. Presently, one can do:

TYPE vertex
   INTEGER :: start_of_neighbors ! The list of neighbors
END TYPE vertex

where start_of_neighbours is an index into some array where the neighbour 
lists for all vertices are concatenated. This usage of integers instead of 
(or as) pointers is common on FORTRAN, and efficient, but has a very big 
defficiency. An integer index *assumes* that there is only one array where 
neighbours are stored. But in dynamic applications there may be several 
buffers used for storing vertices, and a pointer is much better then an 
integer:

TYPE vertex
   INTEGER, DIMENSION(:), POINTER :: neighbors ! The list of neighbors
END TYPE vertex

Now, one has freedom of where the neighbors are stored and how they are
allocated, and can simply use pointer assignment on neighbors to change
this. For efficiency reasons, one would almost allocate several large
neighbour arrays when initializing the graph, and then chop them
into small pieces, one for each vertex, using pointer assignment. 
An example code segment might be:

TYPE(vertex), DIMENSION(N) :: V ! Vertex set
INTEGER, DIMENSION(N*d) :: N ! Neighbour set, d is maximal degree
INTEGER :: vertex, counter, degree

counter=1
DO vertex=1, N
  degree=... ! Assign value
  V(vertex)%neighbors=>N(counter:counter+degree) ! Pointer assignment
  counter=counter+degree
END DO

This approach is nice to use and allows one to have freedom in how the
neighbour lists are allocated, for example. The above code has a big
efficiency problem though, which is very important in practice. The
array pointer neighbours in the type vertex usually takes a lot of
memory, since the array pointer concept of Fortran 90 requires that
adress, stride and bound information be stored. The compilers I have
used usually pad this to some large value such as 16 or 32 bytes. This
storage requirement is excessive and in many cases not necessary. For
example, stride information is often not needed since the user knows
that he will only use memory contigous blocks, and in some cases, such
as skip linked search lists, the size (bound) information is also not
needed.

TYPE vertex
   INTEGER :: degree=0
   INTEGER, DIMENSION(*), POINTER :: neighbours
END TYPE vertex

then the assignment of the neighbour list in the above code would be
substituted with:

V(vertex)%degree=degree
V(vertex)%neighbors=>N(counter) ! Or N(counter:)
   ! Or N(counter:counter+degree)

The syntax bellows does not use POINTER but MOVABLE to avoid conflicts with 
the existing words in the standard.

2. THE MOVABLE ARRAY

Our starting point is the assumed-size array. We call our new sort of
array 'movable' for the moment. We are not committed to this adjective,
but we want to avoid 'pointer' since this is already used extensively
in the standard with another meaning. A movable array can be moved from
one target to another with the pointer assignment statement:

   real, movable :: a(*)
   real, target  :: t(100)
   a => t

and allocated and deallocated:

   allocate (a(30))
   deallocate (a)

We do not want any array copying to take place with such a pointer
assignment, so the right-hand side must be an array that is movable,
assumed-size, allocatable, or explicit-size. It must have the same type
and must have the target attribute. An element of such an array is
allowed, too (as for the actual argument corresponding to an
assumed-size dummy array). The ranks are not required to agree (again,
as for the actual argument corresponding to an assumed-size dummy
array), and in such cases array element sequence association between
the target and the movable array is implied.

Deallocation will be allowed only if the target was allocated as a movable 
array.

Movable arrays can also be null, tested for null, and tested for being 
associated with the same target:

   real, movable :: a(*), b(*)=>null(), c(*)
    ...
   a => null()
   nullify(c)
   if (associated(b)) then
    ...
   if (associated(a,b)) then

The two-argument version tests only that a and b share the same first element.

We expect the implementation of a movable array to be like that for an
assumed-size array. Mostly, its descriptor will consist of an address
only.  However, a debugging compiler might also hold its size and a
flag to indicate whether the target was allocated as a movable array.

An explicit interface will be required like for allocatable array
arguments. If the dummy argument is a movable array, the actual
argument must be a movable array. If the actual argument is a movable
array, the dummy argument must be a movable, explicit-shape or
assumed-size array.

We will also permit movable arrays as components of types:

   type my_data
      real, movable :: a(*) => null()
   end type my_data

and we permit multi-rank movable arrays:

   subroutine mine(lda)
   integer :: lda
   real, movable :: a(lda,*)

   type my_data
      integer :: lda
      real, movable :: a(lda,*)
   end type my_data

The bounds must be defined whenever a movable array is referenced and
must not be altered while a movable array is associated with a target.
If a multi-rank movable array is a component of a type, the bounds of
its leading extents must be integer expressions depending only on other
components of the type.

For the sake of optimization, we propose that the rules that apply to
assumed-size arrays with respect to aliasing should apply also to
movable arrays. While a movable array is associated with a target,
action that affects value of the target must be taken through the
movable array.

3. INTEROPERABILITY WITH C

A movable array is interoperable with a C pointer provided their types
correspond. It may be a component of a type that corresponds to a C
struct type with a C pointer of a corresponding type in the
corresponding position. Entities of such types may be passed in a
procedure call under the existing rules.

If a movable array appears directly in an argument list, the VALUE
attribute refers to the descriptor (usually just an integer holding the
address). If the VALUE attribute is present, the corresponding actual
argument must be a C pointer whose referenced type is interoperable
with the type of the movable array. If absent, the corresponding actual
argument must be a pointer to a pointer whose referenced type is
interoperable with the type of the movable array. For example,

   void AllocateIntegerArray(int ** a, const int n)
   { *a=(int *) malloc(n*sizeof(int)); }

is interoperable with:

  interface
    subroutine AllocateIntegerArray(a, n), bind(C)
        use iso_c_binding
        integer(c_int), dimension(*), movable :: a
        integer(c_int), intent(in), value :: n
    end subroutine AllocateIntegerArray
  end interface

Note that a movable array provides a way to dereference some C pointers.
