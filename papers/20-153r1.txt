Subject: ambiguous READ
References: 20-007

The statement

      READ (CVAR)

where CVAR is a default character variable is syntactically
ambiguous.  Syntax rule R1210 of 20-007 has two
alternatives.  The statement can be derived from both
alternatives.  The first alternative is

      READ ( \si{io-control-spec-list} )
              [ \si{input-item-list ]

In this alternative, CVAR is the \si{io-control-spec-list},
and the statement is an input statement that reads from an
internal file.  The second alternative is

      READ \si{format} [ , \si{input-item-list} ]

In this alternative, CVAR is a named variable in the
parenthesized expression "(CVAR)" that is the \si{format}.

If the statement is interpreted as an input statement that
reads from an internal file, it is not standard conformant.
Paragraph 2 of subclause 12.6.4.3 "Identifying a unit" of
20-007 states

    The unit identified by an unformatted data transfer
    statement shall be an external unit.

The interpretation of the statement as a formatted input
statement has no such problem.

To resolve the syntactic ambiguity, the restriction
presented in subclause 12.6.4.3 should be promoted
to a constraint.  Edits to 20-007 are supplied.

EDITS to 20-007:
[12.6.1 "Form of input and output statements" p1+,
 page:9-]
Following Note 1, insert the new note
 "Note 2
  A statement of the form

      READ (\su{name})

  where \su{name} is the name of a default character
  variable is a formatted input statement.  The format
  expression "(\su{name})" is the \si{format}.  The
  statement cannot be an input statement that specifies
  an internal file because of C1219a."

[12.6.2.1 "Syntax" p1+, page 233:13+]
Insert
 "C1219a (R1213)  If \si{io-unit} is an
         \si{internal-file-variable}, the
         \si{io-control-spec-list} shall contain a
         \si{format} or a \si{namelist-group-name}.

[12.6.4.3 "Identifying a unit" p2, page 241:3]
Delete the paragraph "The unit identified ... unit."
