The following are fixes for typos, spelling errors, and similarly
trivial errors in the CD.  All page/line references are to 02-007r3,
aka the CD.  Other people have pointed these out to me; I make no
attempt at attribution here.

 [56:Note 4.50 last line] "END FUNCTION POINT_3D" -> 
                          "END FUNCTION POINT_3D_LENGTH"
 [202:28] specifer -> specifier
 [350:9] depedent -> dependent
 [377:Note 14.12] "LOGICAL MATRIX_ERROR = .FALSE." ->
                  "LOGICAL :: MATRIX_ERROR = .FALSE."
    (One could argue for other colons in this and the subsequent
     note, but that is a style question.  This one is an error).
