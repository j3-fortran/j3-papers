Discussion

Part 4 of paper N1695 contains the list of new intrinsics related to
bit manipulation for which BOZ arguments are allowed. Edits are
provided to put this capability back into the f08 draft. Also, the
standard text about intepreting integers as bit sequences is added to
some of the new shift intrinsics since those functions are now
described in terms of type integer rather than type bits. A wording
fix for SHIFTL is also supplied.


Edits to 07-007r3:

--------------------------------

At the following locations:
[382:18-21]    In 13.7.78 IAND,
[384:34-385:1] In 13.7.84 IEOR,
[386:33-36]    In 13.7.88 IOR,

replace the Argument and Result Characteristics descriptions with:

"Arguments.

 I     shall be of type integer or a <boz-literal-constant>.

 J     shall be of type integer or a <boz-literal-constant>. If both
       I and J are of type integer they shall have the same kind type
       parameter. I and J shall not both be <boz-literal-constant>s.

Result Characteristics. Same as I if I is of type integer; otherwise,
same as J."

-----------------------------

At the following locations:
[371:14-18] In 13.7.55 DSHIFTL,
[371:27-31] In 13.7.56 DSHIFTR,

replace the Argument and Result Characteristics descriptions with:

"Arguments.

 I     shall be of type integer or a <boz-literal-constant>.

 J     shall be of type integer or a <boz-literal-constant>. If both
       I and J are of type integer they shall have the same kind type
       parameter. I and J shall not both be <boz-literal-constant>s.

SHFT   shall be of type integer. It shall be nonnegative.  It shall be
       less than or equal to BIT_SIZE(I) if I is of type integer;
       otherwise it shall be less than or equal to BIT_SIZE(J).

Result Characteristics. Same as I if I is of type integer; otherwise,
same as J."


-----------------------------

At the following locations:
[371:19] In 13.7.55 DSHIFTL,
[371:32] In 13.7.56 DSHIFTR,
[382:22] In 13.7.78 IAND,
[385:2]  In 13.7.84 IEOR,
[386:37] In 13.7.88 IOR,

add this sentence at the beginning of the "Result value." paragraph:

"If either I or J is a <boz-literal-constant>, it is first converted as if
by the INT intrinsic function to type integer with the kind type parameter
of the other."

-----------------------------

At the following locations:
[371:21+] In 13.7.55 DSHIFTL,
[371:34+] In 13.7.56 DSHIFTR,

add a new paragraph at the end of the Result Value section:

"The model for the interpretation of an integer value as a sequence
of bits is in 13.3."

-----------------------------

[397:34-398:2] In 13.7.114 MERGE_BITS, replace the Arguments and
Result Characteristics paragraphs with:

"Arguments.

 I     shall be of type integer or a <boz-literal-constant>.

 J     shall be of type integer or a <boz-literal-constant>. If both
       I and J are of type integer they shall have the same kind type
       parameter. I and J shall not both be <boz-literal-constant>s.

 MASK shall be of type integer or a <boz-literal-constant>. If MASK is
      of type integer, it shall have the same kind type parameter as I
      if I is of type integer, and the same kind type parameter as J
      if J is of type integer.

Result Characteristics. Same as I if I is of type integer; otherwise,
same as J."

[398:3] In 13.7.114 MERGE_BITS, add two new sentences at the beginning
of the Result Value paragrpah:

"If either I or J is a <boz-literal-constant>, it is first converted as if
by the INT intrinsic function to type integer with the kind type parameter
of the other. If MASK is a <boz-literal-constant>, it is first converted
as if by the INT intrinsic function to type integer with the kind type
parameter of the result."

-----------------------------

The sentence structure for the Result Value paragraphs of SHIFTL and
SHIFTR should be more similar.

[417:9] In the Result Value paragraph of 13.7.154 SHIFTL replace

"The result has a value equal to "

with

"The value of the result is"

to match the form in SHIFTR at [417:18].
