Subject: Issue 7 : co-dimension definition
Reference: J3/06-007


Discussion of Issue 7 (page 21)
 
As requested by the editor, an edit is provided to define the term
'co-dimension'. We have taken the opportunity to edit the definition
of 'co-array' to avoid the so-far-undefined term 'co-rank'.

Edit to J3/06-007

[21:18] Change 'nonzero co-rank' to 'a <co-array-spec>'. 

[21:20] Before 'The co-array' add sentence:

"In the scalar case, the set of co-arrays on all the images is
arranged in a rectangular pattern; in the array case, the set of
corresponding co-array elements on all the images is arranged in a
rectangular pattern; in both cases, the dimensions of the pattern are
called <<co-dimensions>>."
