=================================================
Foreword

ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) and IEC (the
International Electrotechnical Commission) form the specialized system for
worldwide standardization.  National bodies that are members of ISO or IEC
participate in the development of International Standards through technical
committees established by the respective organization to deal with
particular
fields of technical activity.  ISO and IEC technical committees collaborate
in
fields of mutual interest.  Other international organizations, governmental
and
nongovernmental, in liaison with ISO and IEC, also take part in the work.

In the field of information technology, ISO and IEC have established  a
joint
technical committee,ISO/IEC JTC 1.  Draft International Standards adopted by
the
joint technical committee are circulated to national bodies for voting.
Publication of an International Standard requires approval by at least 75%
of
the national bodies casting a vote.

International Standard ISO/IEC 1539-1 was prepared by Joint Technical
Committee
ISO/IEC/JTC1, Information technology, Subcommittee SC22, Programming
languages,
their environments and system software interfaces.

This third edition cancels and replaces the second edition (ISO/IEC
1539-1:1991), which has been technically revised.

ISO/IEC 1539 consists of the following parts, under the general title
Information technology - Programming languages - Fortran:

-  Part 1: Base language

-  Part 2: Varying length character strings

-  Part 3: Conditional Compilation

Annexes A to D of this part of ISO/IEC 1539 are for information only.

Introduction

Standard programming language Fortran

This part of the international standard comprises the specification of the
base
Fortran language, informally known as Fortran 2000.  With the limitations
noted
in 1.5.1, the syntax and semantics of Fortran 95 are contained entirely
within
Fortran 2000. Therefore, any standard-conforming Fortran 95 program not
affected
by such limitations is a standard conforming Fortran 2000 program.  New
features
of Fortran 2000 can be compatibly incorporated into such Fortran 95
programs,
with any exceptions indicated in the text of this part of the standard.

Fortran 2000 contains several extensions to Fortran 95; the major ones are:

(1)     Asynchronous and stream I/O

(2)     Derived type enhancements (parameterized derived types, derived type
I/O)

(3)     Object oriented technologies (including extensible types,
inheritance,

                  polymorphism, procedure pointers, initializers/finalizers)

(4)   Support of exceptions and IEEE arithmetic

(5)   Interoperability with programming language C

(6)   Support for cultural adapability

Organization of this part of ISO/IEC 1539

This part of ISO/IEC 1539 is organized in 16 sections, dealing with 8
conceptual
areas.  These 8 areas, and the sections in which they are treated, are :

High/low level concepts
        Sections 1, 2, 3

Data concepts
        Sections 4, 5, 6

Computations
        Sections 7, 13, 15

Execution control
        Section 8

Input/output
        Sections 9, 10

Program units
        Sections 11, 12

Scoping and association rules
        Section 14

Interoperability with C
        Section 16

High/low level concepts

Section 2 (Fortran terms and concepts) contains many of the high level
concepts
of Fortran.  This includes the concept of a program and the relationships
among
its major parts.  Also included are
the syntax of program units, the rules for statement ordering, and the
definitions of many of the fundamental terms used throughout this part of
ISO/IEC 1539.

Section 3 (Characters, lexical tokens, and source form) describes the low
level
elements of Fortran, such as the character set and the allowable forms for
source programs.  It also contains the rules for constructing literal
constants
and names for Fortran entities, and lists all of the Fortran operators.

Data concepts

The array operations and data structures provide a rich set of data concepts
in
Fortran.  The main concepts are those of data type, data object, and the use
of
data objects, which are described in Sections 4, 5, and 6, respectively.

Section 4 (Data types) describes the distinction between a data type and a
data
object, and then focuses on data type.  It defines a data type as a set of
data
values, corresponding forms (constants) for representing these values, and
operations on these values.  The concept of an intrinsic data type is
introduced, and the properties of Fortran's intrinsic types (integer, real,
complex, logical,and character) are described.  Note that only type concepts
are
described here, and not the declaration and properties of data objects.

Section 4 also introduces the concept of derived (user-defined) data types,
which are compound types whose components ultimately resolve into intrinsic
types.  The details of defining a derived type are given (note that this has
no
counterpart with intrinsic types; intrinsic types are defined by the
language
and therefore need not - indeed cannot - be redefined by the programmer).
As
with intrinsic types, this section deals only with type properties, and not
with
the declaration of data objects of derived type.

J3 note - need some comment on derived type parameters and the OOP stuff.

Section 5 (Data object declarations and specifications) describes in detail
how
named data objects are declared and given the desired properties
(attributes).
An important attribute (the only one required for each data object) is the
data
type, so the type declaration statement is the main feature of this section.
The various attributes are described in detail, as well as the two ways that
attributes may be specified (type declaration statements and attribute
specification statements).  Implicit typing and storage association (COMMON
and
EQUIVALENCE) are also described in this section, as well as data object
value
initialization.

Section 6 (Use of data objects) deals mainly with the concept of a variable,
and
describes the various forms that variables may take.  Scalar variables
include
character strings and substrings, structured (derived-type) objects,
structure
components, and array elements.  Array variables include whole arrays and
array
sections.  Among the array facilities described here are array operations,
allocation and deallocation (user controlled dynamic arrays).  New in
Fortran
2000 is the ability to declare the ALLOCATABLE attribute for a scalar
structure
component or object.

Computations

Section 7 (Expressions and assignment) describes how computations are
expressed
in Fortran.  This includes the forms that expression operands (primaries)
may
take and the role of operators in these expressions.  Operator precedence is
rigorously defined in syntax rules and summarized in tabular form.  This
description includes the relationship of defined operators (user-defined
operators) to the intrinsic operators (+, *, .AND., .OR., etc.).  The rules
for
both expression evaluation and the interpretation (semantics) of intrinsic
and
defined operators are described in detail.

Section 7 also describes assignment of computational results to data
objects,
which has four principal forms: the conventional assignment statement, the
pointer assignment statement, the WHERE statement and construct, and the
FORALL
statement and construct.  The WHERE and FORALL statements and constructs
allow
masked array assignment, the main difference between WHERE and FORALL being
that
FORALL makes use of element subscripts whereas WHERE is whole array
oriented.

Section 13 (Intrinsic procedures) describes more than one hundred intrinsic
procedures that provide a rich set of computational capabilities.  In
addition
to the Fortran 95 intrinsic procedures, this includes

J3 note - complete the preceding sentence.

J3 note - need some comment on IEEE stuff.

Execution control

Section 8 (Execution control) describes the control constructs (IF, CASE,
and
DO), and the control statements (IF, CONTINUE, GO TO, and STOP).

Input/output

Section 9 (Input/output statements) contains definitions for records, files,
file connections (OPEN, CLOSE, and preconnected files), data transfer
statements
(READ, WRITE, and PRINT) that include processing of partial and variable
length
records, file positioning (REWIND and BACKSPACE), and file inquiry
(INQUIRE).

J3 note - need some comment on asynchronous, stream, and derived type I/O.

Section 10 (Input/output editing) describes input/output formatting.  This
includes the FORMAT statement and FMT= specifier, edit descriptors,
list-directed formatting, and namelist formatting.

Program units

Section 11 (Program units) describes main programs, external subprograms,
modules, and block data program units.  Modules, along with the USE
statement,
are described as a mechanism for encapsulating data and procedure
definitions
that are to be used by (accessible to) other program units.  Modules are
described as vehicles for defining global derived-type definitions, global
data
object declarations, procedure libraries, and combinations thereof.  A
module
may be intrinsic (defined by the standard) or nonintrinsic (defined by
Fortran
code).

Section 12 (Procedures) contains a comprehensive treatment of procedure
definition and invocation, including that for user-defined functions and
subroutines.  The concepts of implicit and explicit procedure interfaces are
explained, and situations requiring explicit procedure interfaces are
identified.  The rules governing actual and dummy arguments, and their
association, are described.  PURE procedures and ELEMENTAL procedures (which
are
PURE procedures that may be called elementally) are free of side effects,
thereby facilitating parallel processing.

Section 12 also describes the use of the OPERATOR option in interface blocks
to
allow function invocation in the form of infix and prefix operators as well
as
the traditional functional form.  Similarly, the use of the ASSIGNMENT
option in
interface blocks is described as allowing an alternate syntax for certain
subroutine calls.  This section also contains descriptions of recursive
procedures, the RETURN statement, the ENTRY statement, internal procedures
and
the CONTAINS statement, statement functions, generic procedure names, and
the
means of accessing non-Fortran procedures.

Scoping and association rules

Section 14 (Scope, association, and definition) explains the use of the term
"scope" and describes the scope properties of various entities, including
names
and operators.  Also described are the general rules governing procedure
argument association, pointer association, and storage association.
Finally,
Section 14 describes the events that cause variables to become defined (have
predictable values) and events that cause variables to become undefined.

Interoperability with C

Section 16 describes mechanisms that allow Fortran data objects and
procedures
to interoperate with data objects and procedures declared by means other
than
Fortran.

Annexes

Annex A.  A glossary of common and important terms used in this part of
ISO/IEC
1539.

Annex B.  A list of all obsolescent features and descriptions of all deleted
features.  Obsolescent features are still part of Fortran 2000 and are
described
in the normative portions of this part of ISO/IEC 1539.  Deleted features
are
not part of standard Fortran 2000, but they are described completely in this
annex for the benefit of those implementations that provide complete
backward
compatibility with Fortran 90.

Annex C.  Long notes of explanation, examples, rationales and other
informative
material.  Wherever feasible such material is integrated into the normative
sections of this part of ISO/IEC 1539, but clearly identified as supporting
informative material.  In those cases in which such informative material is
so
extensive that it would unduly disrupt the flow of normative discourse, the
material is placed in this annex.

Annex D.  A comprehensive index to this part of ISO/IEC 1539, including the
use
of principal terms in the syntax rules.
