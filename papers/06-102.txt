Subject: C interop of dummy procedures

NUMBER: F03/0073
TITLE: C interop of dummy procedures
KEYWORDS: Interoperability, dummy procedures
DEFECT TYPE: ERRATUM
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Is the following interface interoperable, and if yes, what is the
interoperable C prototype?

use iso_c_binding
subroutine my_sub(my_fun) bind(c, name="My_Proc")
    interface
       function my_fun(x) bind(c)
          use iso_c_binding
          integer(c_int) :: my_fun
          real(c_double), value :: x
       end function
    end interface
end subroutine

ANSWER:

Yes, this interface is interoperable with the following protype:

   void My_Sub(int (*my_fun)(double))

or equivalently (according to the C standard)

   void My_Sub(int my_fun(double))


Item (5) in the list in section 15.2.6 seems to have been written with
only data objects in mind, and it is not clear whether it applies to
dummy procedures. I quote it here:

(5) any dummy argument without the VALUE attribute corresponds to a 
formal parameter of the prototype that is of a pointer type, and the 
dummy argument is interoperable with an entity of the referenced  type
(C International Standard, 6.2.5, 7.17, and 7.18.1) of the  formal
parameter;

We believe that the intention is that dummy procedures be included, and
that this text should be revised accordingly.

EDITS:

In item (5) in the list in section 15.2.6, replace "any dummy argument
without the VALUE attribute" with "any dummy argument that is not a
procedure and does not have the VALUE attribute" and replace "pointer
type" with "object pointer type".

and add a new item (5+) to the list:

(5+) any dummy procedure argument corresponds to a formal parameter of
the prototype that is of function pointer type, and the dummy procedure
is interoperable with a function of the referenced type of the formal
parameter;
