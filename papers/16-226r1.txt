Discussion:
-----------

The style of the description of the ALLOCATABLE attribute is different
from the descriptions of other attributes.

Other descriptions begin "The XYZ attribute specifies..."

Edits to J3/16-007r1:
---------------------

[92:18-19 5.5,3p1] Replace the paragraph:

"The ALLOCATABLE attribute specifies that an entity is allocatable.
Space for an allocatable variable is allocated by an ALLOCATE statement
(6.7.1), intrinsic assignment statement (7.2.1.2), or structure
constructor (4.5.10)."
