Subject:	Floating Point Subset of ENABLE

This paper is presented in the belief that handling floating point 
exceptions is important to keeping Fortran competitive in high 
performance numerical computation.

It describes a highly restricted and simplified facility that is 
(close to) a subset of the Edinburgh proposal on exception 
handling.  It is believed to address and resolve the technical 
concerns raised in response to that proposal.  While this subset 
does not provide anywhere close to the functionality of the 
Edinburgh proposal, it does provide the "80% solution" for 
floating point exceptions (FPEs).  It also is extendible to 
(something close to) the Edinburgh proposal and/or an exception 
handling facility, such as discussed thus far, modeled on a 
condition data type. 

This subset deals only with FPE events, including floating 
overflow and floating point divide-by-zero,  though the 
processor may detect additional exceptions. Signaling outside 
any enable construct are (allowed but are) processor dependent.  
The enable construct has the general form
         ENABLE		
              enable block	
         [ HANDLE	
              handle block ]	
         END ENABLE		
which may be considered roughly functionally equivalent to 
the Edinburgh form of
         ENABLE (FLOATING_POINT)
              enable block
         HANDLE
              handle block
         END ENABLE
If a future proposal needs the meaning that the Edinburgh 
proposal had for the simple ENABLE and HANDLE statements, 
the syntax ENABLE ( ) and HANDLE ( ) could be used. 

If an FPE signals during the execution of the enable block, 
control is transferred to the handle block; otherwise the handle 
block is not executed.  Any FPE that triggers execution of a 
handle block is cleared prior to entering a handle block. This is 
not consistent with the Edinburgh proposal, which allowed 
inquiries to be made about the specific nature of signaling prior 
to handling. A future proposal could restore this functionality as 
an option on the HANDLE statement.

As in the Edinburgh proposal, the transfer to the handle block 
after a signal is imprecise in order to allow for optimizations.  
Any variable that is defined or redefined in such an "uncertainty 
scope" becomes undefined.  The handler may specify returning 
the signal to the calling program.

A significant simplification over the Edinburgh proposal is that 
if a signal is not handled in the procedure in which it was 
generated, the processor is required to handle it in the caller only 
if (1) the call to the procedure is itself in an enable construct and 
(2) the signal is generated in an enable construct in the callee.  If 
either of these two requirements is not met then the signal is 
"lost" in the sense that the situation becomes processor 
dependent.  For guaranteed handling up the call chain a 
condition must be so "fully enabled" on both ends of each call.

The SIGNAL statement, which can appear only in an enable 
construct, allows the user to explicitly signal an FPE.  The signal 
statement has the form  SIGNAL  which may be considered roughly equivalent to
the Edinburgh form of  SIGNAL (FLOATING_POINT).

This subset enables and handles floating point exceptions, and 
allows the user to signal a floating point exception, but does not 
provide any sort of "finer grained" treatment of exceptions.  In 
particular, any notion of "condition value" is intentionally 
omitted, so as not to unduly impact the nature of future 
extension.

2.4.8 Condition

Within an enable construct, a condition is signaled by the 
processor upon occurrence of a floating point exception, such 
as overflow, during program execution.  How the processor 
represents such exception conditions is processor dependent.  
Outside of enable constructs the meaning of exception 
conditions is processor dependent.  The processor is required to 
support the exceptions floating point overflow and floating 
point divide-by-zero; the processor may detect and signal other 
exceptions as well.

[Footnote: In a multitasking environment each virtual processor 
supports its own exception conditions. If an enable construct 
contains statements that spawn tasks, enable, handle, and end-
enable statements act as barriers at which such exception 
condition values are merged.  Condition handling and the enable 
construct are permitted in a pure procedure.]

8.1.5 Condition handling

The processor is required to signal a condition if a floating point 
exception occurs during execution of an intrinsic operation 
within an enable construct.   The processor is permitted, but not 
required, to signal if a floating point exception occurs during 
execution of an intrinsic function.  Within an enable construct, 
the user may signal with the SIGNAL statement.  The processor 
may signal outside of an enable construct, but the meaning of 
such a signal is processor dependent.

[Footnote:  Note that a SIGNAL statement may not appear 
outside of an enable construct.]

[Footnote: On many processors, it is expected that some 
exception conditions will cause no alteration to the flow of 
control when they are signaled and that they will be tested only 
when the enable block completes.  On other processors, this may 
be very expensive, and on them the handler may be invoked at 
the time of signaling or soon thereafter.]

In a sequence of statements that contains no condition handling 
statements, if the execution of a process would cause signaling 
but after execution of the sequence no value of a variable 
depends on the process, whether signaling occurs is processor 
dependent.  For example, when Y has the value zero, whether 
the code
           X = 1.0/Y
           X = 3.0
signals is processor dependent. 

A signal must not occur if it could arise only during execution of 
a process beyond those required or permitted by the standard.  
For example, the division in the statement
           IF (X>1.) Y = Z/X
must not signal when X is less than 1.0, and for the statement
           WHERE(A>0.) A = LOG (A)
negative elements of A must not cause signaling. On the other 
hand, when X has the value 1.0 and Y has the value 0.0, the 
expression
           X>0.00001 .OR. X/Y>0.00001
is permitted to cause  signaling.

[Footnote: In general, it is intended that implementations be free 
within enable constructs to use the code motion techniques that 
they use outside enable constructs.]

8.1.5.1. The enable construct

The enable construct contains an enable block, and (optionally) 
a handle block.  The handle block is executed only if execution 
of the enable block leads to signaling.

R835a    enable-construct  	is  	enable-stmt
                                     		enable-block
                                 	[ handle-stmt
                                     		handle-block ]
                                 	end-enable-stmt
 
R835b    enable-stmt         	is  	[ enable-construct-
name : ]  ENABLE

R835c    enable-block        	is  	block
  
R835d    handle-stmt         	is  	HANDLE  [ enable-
construct-name ]

R835e    handle-block        	is  	block

R835f    end-enable-stmt     	is  	END ENABLE [ 
enable-construct-name ]
 
Constraint: If the enable-stmt of an enable-construct is 
identified by an enable-construct-name, the corresponding end-
enable-stmt must specify the same enable-construct-name. If the 
enable-stmt of an enable-construct is not identified by an 
enable-construct-name, the corresponding end-enable-stmt must 
not specify an enable-construct-name. If the handle-stmt is 
identified by an enable-construct-name, the corresponding 
enable-stmt must specify the same enable-construct-name.

Constraint: An enable-block must not contain a cycle-stmt, exit-
stmt, or branch statement that would cause branching outside of 
the enable-block. An alternate return specifier in an enable-
block must not specify the label of a statement outside the block.  
An ERR=, END=, or EOR= specifier in a statement in an 
enable-block must not be the label of a statement outside the 
block.

Constraint: A handle-block must not contain a cycle-stmt, exit-
stmt, or branch statement that would cause branching outside of 
the handle-block. An alternate return specifier in an handle-
block must not specify the label of a statement outside the block.  
An ERR=, END=, or EOR= specifier in a statement in an 
handle-block must not be the label of a statement outside the 
block.

If an enable construct has no handler, the effect is as if it had the 
following handler:
	HANDLE
	SIGNAL

An ENABLE statement may be a branch target statement (8.2). 

[Footnote: Neither a HANDLE statement nor an END ENABLE 
statement is permitted to be a branch target.  A handle block is 
intended for execution only following signaling in its enable 
block, and an END ENABLE statement is not a sensible target 
because it would permit skipping the handling of an exception.]

[Footnote: Nesting of enable constructs is permitted.  An enable 
or handle block may itself contain an enable construct.  Also, 
nesting with other constructs is permitted, subject to the usual 
rules for proper nesting of constructs.]

[Footnote: Note that in a function subprogram it is very 
desirable to ensure that the function value is defined even if an 
exception has occurred and is expected to be handled in the 
calling subprogram.  If the function value is not defined, 
additional exceptions may occur during evaluation of the 
expression that gave rise to the function call.]

8.1.5.2 Execution of an enable construct

Execution of an enable construct begins with the first executable 
construct of the enable block and continues to the end of the 
block unless a condition is signaled.  An uncertainty scope 
consists of a (possibly null) sequence of statements in an enable 
construct between any pair of consecutive ENABLE, HANDLE, 
and END ENABLE statements. If a signal is associated with 
(occurs in) an uncertainty scope, there is a transfer of control 
sometime during execution of the uncertainty scope subsequent 
to the signaling.  If the uncertainty scope is in an enable block, 
the (effect is as if the) transfer is to the associated HANDLE 
statement.  If the uncertainty scope is in a handle block the 
transfer is to the associated END ENABLE statement, thereby 
completing execution of the enable construct with the condition 
still signaling.  Any variable that might be defined or redefined 
by execution of a statement of the uncertainty scope or of a 
procedure invoked in such a statement is undefined, any pointer 
whose pointer association might be altered has undefined 
pointer association status, any allocatable array that might be 
allocated or deallocated may have been allocated or become 
unallocated, and the file position of any file specified in an 
input/output statement that might be executed is processor 
dependent.

[Footnote: The transfer to the handle block is imprecise and 
processor dependent in order to allow for optimizations such as 
vectorization. As a consequence, some variables become 
undefined. In Example 1 of 8.1.5.4, a copy of the matrix itself 
would need to be available for the slow algorithm.]

Although branching from within an enable construct to outside 
of the construct is not allowed, a RETURN or STOP statement 
is permitted in an enable construct.

If execution of the enable block completes without any of its 
uncertainty scopes signaling, the execution of the enable 
construct is complete.

If the handler is invoked, the signal(s) triggering the handler are 
cleared by the HANDLE statement and then execution proceeds 
with the first executable construct of the handle block.  
Completion of execution of the handle block completes the 
execution of the enable construct.

If execution of an enable construct completes with a condition 
still signaling (that is, the signal is not cleared by execution of a 
HANDLE statement), an immediate transfer takes place.  For 
the purposes of determining the nature of the transfer in the case 
of a nested enable construct, the signal is considered to be 
associated with the uncertainty scope immediately following the 
enable construct.  In the case of an enable construct not nested in 
another enable construct, the transfer is to return to the calling 
program (or stop, if in a main program), propagating the signal 
to the caller.

[Footnote: Note that the mechanism by which a signal is 
propagated to the caller is completion of execution of an (outer) 
enable construct with a condition still signaling - that is, if a 
signal has occurred in the enable construct and not cleared by a 
HANDLE statement.  Note also that the statement pair  
SIGNAL; RETURN  cannot be relied upon to propagate a signal 
to the caller because of the uncertainty of when the effects of 
signaling take place.  Finally, note that for guaranteed handling 
of a signal propagated to the caller, the call must be in an enable 
construct.  Examples 3 and 4 in 8.1.5.4 both illustrate signal 
propagation back to the caller.]

[Footnote:  Note that if the processor supports signaling outside 
of enable constructs, and such a signal exists upon execution of 
an enable statement, the effect is as if a return (or stop in a main 
program) is executed with the signal propagating to the caller.]

8.1.5.3 Signal statement

R835g     signal-stmt   is  SIGNAL 

Constraint: A signal-stmt may appear only in an enable-construct. 

The SIGNAL statement signals a floating point exception.  The 
effect of executing a SIGNAL statement is the same as if the 
processor had signaled the condition.

8.1.5.4 Examples of ENABLE constructs

Example 1:

   ENABLE 
    ! First try the "fast" algorithm for inverting a matrix:
      MATRIX1 = FAST_INV (MATRIX) 
                        ! MATRIX is not altered during execution of 
FAST_INV.
   HANDLE 
    ! "Fast" algorithm failed; try "slow" one:
      ENABLE 
         MATRIX1 = SLOW_INV (MATRIX)
      HANDLE 
         WRITE (*, *) 'Cannot invert matrix'
         STOP
      END ENABLE
   END ENABLE
 
In this example, the function FAST_INV may signal.  If it does, 
another try is made with SLOW_INV.  If this still  fails, a 
message is printed and the program stops.  Note the use of an  
enable construct within a handler.  Note also that the relevant 
code in both FAST_INV and SLOW_INV must enabled in order 
to guarantee propagation of a signal.

Example 2:

   ENABLE 
   ! First try a fast algorithm for the computation.
    . . .  ! Code that cannot signal a condition.
   DO K = 1, N
      ENABLE
      :
      END ENABLE
   END DO
      ENABLE
      :
      END ENABLE
   HANDLE 
   ! Alternative code which knows that K-1 steps have executed 
normally.
   :
   END ENABLE

Here the code for a computation is in line and the transfer is 
made more  precise by adding to the enable block two enable 
constructs without handlers. 


Example 3:
 
      REAL FUNCTION CABS (Z)
        COMPLEX Z
! Calculate the complex absolute value, using a scaled algorithm
!      if the straightforward calculation overflows. 
! (See also the CABS example, page 225, ACM Transactions on 
!      Mathematical Software, June 1994.)

        REAL S, ZI, ZR
        INTRINSIC REAL, AIMAG, SQRT, ABS, MAX

        ZR = REAL(Z)
        ZI = AIMAG(Z)

quick: 	ENABLE

!         	This is the quick and usual calculation.
          	CABS = SQRT(ZR**2 + ZI**2) 

  	HANDLE  quick

!       	Will try again using a scaled equivalent method.
       	S = MAX(ABS(ZR),ABS(ZI))

  	slow: 	ENABLE
            		      CABS = S*SQRT( (ZR/S)**2 + (ZI/S)**2 ) 
          		END ENABLE  slow
  
 	END ENABLE  quick

      END FUNCTION CABS

Note that a signal propagates back to the caller if the slow 
algorithm fails also (but not if only the fast algorithm fails.


Example 4:

      MODULE LIBRARY
      ...
      CONTAINS
         SUBROUTINE B
            ...
            ENABLE
              	X = Y*Z(I) 
               	IF (X>10.)  SIGNAL
            END ENABLE
            ...
         END SUBROUTINE B
      END MODULE LIBRARY

      SUBROUTINE A
         USE LIBRARY
         ENABLE 
            CALL B
         HANDLE 
            ...
         END ENABLE
      END SUBROUTINE A

In this case the user has defined what constitutes a numeric 
exception in the event that processor overflow has not occurred.  
In either case the handling takes place in subroutine A.

Example 5:

   SUBROUTINE LONG
      REAL, ALLOCATABLE A(:), B(:,:)
      : ! Other specifications
      ENABLE
          :
          ! Lots of code, including many procedure calls
          :
      HANDLE 
          ! Fix-up, including deallocation of any allocated arrays, in 
the event of any 
          ! numeric exceptions that occur in enabled code in called 
procedures.
          IF(ALLOCATED(A)) DEALLOCATE (A)
          IF(ALLOCATED(B)) DEALLOCATE (B)
          :
      END ENABLE
   END SUBROUTINE LONG

Section 8.2 - in first paragraph, after 'end-do-stmt,' add 'an 
enable-stmt,'.
.......................................................................
Section 8.4 - add a new sentence to end of last paragraph:
	If the STOP statement is in an enable construct and a 
condition is signaling, the processor must issue 
	a warning on the unit identified by * in a WRITE 
statement, indicating that an exception has occurred.
