Subject: Gw and G0.d Formats
Date: 2008 November 17

This document supersedes 08-251r3 and incorporates some of the
suggestions from N1743.

Commenter's Subject was "The g0 edit descriptor"

According to the draft document:

  C1007 (R1006) For the G edit descriptor, d shall be
   specified if and only if w is not zero.

To me this eliminates any value the g0 feature might
have.  What's needed is something like list-directed
output but with the precision controlled by the
programmer.

For example, in order for an input item to have the
same internal value as the original value that was
output, the output must generally carry at least 9
digits (for IEEE single precision).

If the ability to specify d were present, G would
probably become my main output edit descriptor.  I was
looking forward to g0 before I found that it wasn't
allowed a d part.

J3's response:

J3 agrees that this would be a useful feature.

In the original J3 response, 08-251r3, G0.d, like G0, was defined in
terms of the ESw.d format, meaning that even values close to zero
would be shown in E format, unlike the Gw.d format (for w>0) which
would choose F format for such values.  N1743 suggested that G0 and
G0.d behave more like Gw.d in such cases and J3 agrees.

N1743 further proposed that "redundant" characters in the formatted
value, such as leading zeros and the plus sign in an exponent, be
removed so as to make the result even more compact. J3 feels that this
formatting style is unlike any other in Fortran and has chosen the
more conservative approach of defining G0 and G0.d in terms of Gw.dEe
with the addition of having leading and trailing blanks removed.

Edits:

[xiii:2] In Introduction, paragraph 2, bullet point Input/output,
before "Recursive transfers" add "G0.d and G0 format descriptors give
additional facilities for output of real and complex data."

[243:1] In 10.3.2, delete "and only if" from C1007

Add new constraint after C1007:
"C1007+ (R1006) For the G edit descriptor, <e> shall not be
specified if <w> is zero."

[253:1] In 10.7.5.1, replace "the external field occupies <w>
positions; for real or complex data"  with "the external field occupies
<w> positions. For real or complex data"

[254:2] In 10.7.5.2.2, replace paragraph 2 with:
"When used to specify the output of real or complex data, the
G0 and G0.<d> edit descriptors follow the rules for the
G<w>.<d>E<e> edit descriptor, except that any leading or trailing
blanks are removed. Reasonable processor-dependent
values of <w>, <d> (if not specified), and <e> are used with
each output value."

[461] In A2 Processor dependencies, 10th last bullet, change "the field
width used for the G0 edit descriptor (10.7.5)" to "the field width and
the decimal part width used for the G0 edit descriptor (10.7.5)".
