Interval Arithmetic in Fortran -- Some Specifics

presented by R. Baker Kearfott to meeting 136 of ANSI/X3J3 (Las Vegas,
          Nevada, February 8, 1996)

page 3:  "Overview -- Major Points:"

         The phrase "thou shalt contain" was originally "thou shalt not
         lie," truer to the original.  If the result of an interval
         operation or interval function evaluation contains the exact
         range of the mathematical operation over all points in the
         operands, then algorithms can be designed that don't lie.
         That is, algorithms can be designed that always give
         mathematically rigorous bounds on solutions, or that
         rigorously prove that there are no solutions.

         Concerning the phrase "thou shalt blend in:"  Most of the
         additions to the standard to include an interval data type
         can be made as minor alterations to the wording of the
         existing standard.

page 4:  "Overview -- Some Features:"

         The specification of interval intrinsics mandates that they
         contain the range of the corresponding mathematical function
         over the set of interval arguments.  The holy grail for an
         interval intrinsic is to return the closest floating point
         interval to the actual mathematical result.  However such a
         requirement may make implementation too difficult or make
         evaluation too inefficient in some instances.  Thus, the
         trade-off between "sharpness" and performance is left to the
         implementer.

page 5:  IEEE arithmetic helps with outward roundings.  For example
         (see page 6), in exact interval arithmetic,
         [xl,xu] + [yl,yu] = [xl+yl,xu+yu].  IEEE defines the downward
         rounding as the same result as computing the exact result, then
         rounding into the nearest floating point number less than the
         exact result, and the upward rounding as the same result as
         computing the exact result, then rounding into the nearest
         floating point number greater than the exact result.  Thus,
         if the result xl+xu were rounded down and xu+yu were rounded
         up according to the IEEE specifications, an ideal interval
         addition would result.

         Two (case-insensitive) symbols, -INFINITY and INFINITY, should
         also be defined.  These correspond to negative infinity and
         positive infinity in IEEE arithmetic,  but should be defined
         for all implementations.  The symbol -INFINITY represents
         something less than all floating point numbers, and INFINITY
         represents something greater than all floating point numbers.
         Intervals with one or both endpoints equal to these symbols
         should be allowed, and arithmetic on them is defined,
         consistently with IEEE arithmetic.  The interval
         (<INFINITY,-INFINITY>) shall represent the empty set.  In
         general, intervals in which the upper end point is less than
         the lower endpoint are non-standard.  However, we envision
         various useful non-standard extensions in this context.

page 6:  Multiplication is sometimes implemented as a series of
         eight cases, rather than  four products followed by taking a
         minimum and maximum.  Implemented in software, which
         implementation is most efficient is machine-dependent.

page 8:  These specifications are those of "certainly true"
         operators, true only if they are true for every selection of
         real numbers in the range of the operands.  Extensions can
         include a set of "possibly true" operators, that are true
         if there exists a selection of real numbers in the range
         of the interval operands, and a set of "set-relational"
         operators, true if the relation holds in a set-theoretic
         sense.

page 9:  The function ABS is an interval extension of the real function
         ABS, consistent with the stipulation that interval extensions
         contain the range.  It is included in this table since it is
         closely related to MAG and MIG.  The same is true for the
         function MAX.

page 11: In addition to the VE and VF formats, we will propose the
         SE and SF formats, for single number output of intervals.  The
         basic representation of an interval as a single number is as
         follows:

         1. A single number without a decimal point represents an
            interval whose lower and upper endpoints are identical
            (a degenerate interval).



         2. A single number with a decimal point represents
            an interval whose endpoints are constructed by subtracting
            and adding .5 units in the last decimal digit not exhibited.

         Here are some examples of intervals represented by various
         single numbers:

                Single Number           Interval represented

                (<.1>)                  [0.05,.15]
                (<1>)                   [1, 1]
                (<.1000>)               [.09995, .10005]
                (<1E-1>)                [0.1,0.1]
                (<.0>)                  [-.05,.05]
                (<0.E3>)                [-0.5E3, 0.5E3]

         This type of representation was implemented by G. W. Walster
         in the "M77" compiler, that ran on CDC machines.

         The SE and SF specifiers have the same form as the E and F
         specifiers, i.e. SF<w>.<d> and SE<w>.<d>[E<e>].  However, the
         printed result will not always have <d> digits past the
         decimal point, since there may not be that many identical
         significant digits of the left and right endpoints that are
         equal.  Similarly, for zero-width intervals, no digits past
         the decimal point will be displayed.  However, the number will
         be justified as if all the digits specified by the format were
         printed.  If a number is too inaccrate to be represented
         within a specified SF format, the entire field will be filled
         with asterisks.  Note that the "SF" format, when used for
         zero-width intervals, is limited to integers.  The <w>
         specifies the width of the numerical field, and not the spaces
         taken by "(<" and ">)".  Thus, the total width of an SE or SF
         field would be <w>+4.

         Although the SE and SF specifiers can be used for both input
         and output, they are most useful on output, since the VE and
         VF specifiers will also accept single-number intervals on
         input.

         Interval "G" I/O and list-directed I/O is also defined,
         consistently with corresponding real I/O and the above.

pages 13-14: The order of operations in interval expressions affects
         the result of the expression, as indicated.  However, certain
         optimizations are clearly advantageous.  For example, if each
         variable in the expression occurs only once, then the result
         in exact arithmetic (without outward roundings) is the exact
         range.  This is usually what is intended.  Furthermore, there
         is a correspondence between the amount of overestimation in an
         interval expression and the accuracy of the expression if
         evaluated with real data.  The point is that there are things
         that can be done at the compiler level to optimize the order
         in which interval expressions are evaluated.  The question
         is:  How could such reordering be done in a module?

Questions for X3J3:
__________________

We are not totally satisfied with (<A,B>), and we think that [A,B]
would be better.  However "[" and "]" are not part of the Fortran
character set.  Is there anything that can be done in this regard?  I
have avoided "(" and ")" since it could cause confusion with complex
data, for certain types of I/O.
