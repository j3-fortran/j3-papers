Subject:   Coarray events

Reference: WG5/N1930, 12-201

1. Discussion
-------------

This paper proposes syntax and semantics for coarray events.

2. Requirements (copied from N1930)
-----------------------------------

NOTIFY and QUERY statements were proposed in N1858.  That proposal
matches execution of a NOTIFY statement on one image with execution of
a QUERY statement on another image based on the number of times the
statements are executed on each image.  That mechanism is not robust
in the presence of code reordering.  For example, an image that would
otherwise be idle might bring other work forward.  Event variables
provide a more robust mechanism for synchronizing execution of images.
Event variables allow library routines to use synchronization in a way
that is hidden from and does not interfere with the calling code.

E1: There should be a mechanism to allow one-sided ordering of
    execution segments. For example, suppose image I executes
    successive segments I1 and I2 and image J executes successive
    segments J1 and J2; there might be a need for I1 to precede J2,
    but no need for J1 to precede I2.

E2: The mechanism should use a data entity that is accessible by all
    the images to identify the event. There shall be a type for event
    variables, probably an opaque derived type defined in the
    intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.

E3: Mechanisms shall be provided to post an event, to test if an event
    has been posted, and to wait for an event to be posted. Repeated
    posts to the same event variable increment a counter internal to
    the event variable and waits decrement the counter.  The statements
    implementing event post and wait are image control statements. The
    test operation may be implemented by an inquiry function and hence
    would not be an image control statement.

E4: If multiple event wait operations are waiting on the same event
    variable, which of those operations completes when the
    corresponding event post occurs is unspecified.


3. Modifications to the requirements
------------------------------------

We have kept to the requirements except as follows:

E2. Rather than a single opaque type, two types are provided to enable
efficient implementation of simple events where waiting is limited to
a local event variable.

E3. A subroutine is used to return the event count, with an optional
argument to indicate whether the call was successful.


4. Syntax and Semantics
-----------------------

An image can use an EVENT POST statement to notify another image that it
can proceed to work on tasks that use common resources.  Images can
wait on events posted by other images and can query if images have
posted events.

EVENT_TYPE and LOCAL_EVENT_TYPE are derived types with private
components. They are extensible types with no type parameters. All
components have default initialization.  The types are defined in the
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module.

A scalar variable of type EVENT_TYPE or LOCAL_EVENT_TYPE is an event
variable. An event variable includes a count of the difference between
the number of successful posts and successful waits for the event
variable. The initial value of the count of an event variable is zero.

An <event-variable> in an EVENT WAIT statement of type
LOCAL_EVENT_TYPE shall not be coindexed.

A successful post to an event variable increments its count. If the
count is zero for a wait statement, the executing image shall wait
until the count is positive. A successful wait for an event variable
decrements its count. Unsuccessful posts and waits shall not
change the count.

Two new statements and a new intrinsic subroutine are provided for
event variables.  The statements are

     EVENT POST(<event-variable> [, <sync-stat-list>] )

and

     EVENT WAIT(<event-variable> [, <sync-stat-list>] )

EVENT POST posts to an <event-variable> that is coindexed. EVENT WAIT
waits on an <event-variable> of type LOCAL_EVENT_TYPE that is not
coindexed. EVENT WAIT may wait on an <event-variable> of type
EVENT_TYPE that is coindexed.

The new statements are image control statements.

An event variable shall not appear in a variable definition context
except as the <event-variable> in an EVENT POST or EVENT WAIT
statement, as an <allocate-object> in an ALLOCATE statement without a
SOURCE= <alloc-opt>, or as an actual argument in a reference to a
procedure with an explicit interface where the corresponding dummy
argument has INTENT(INOUT).  A variable with a subobject of type
EVENT_TYPE or LOCAL_EVENT_TYPE shall not appear in a variable
definition context except as an <allocate-object> in an ALLOCATE
statement without a SOURCE= <alloc-opt> or as an actual argument in a
reference to a procedure with an explicit interface where the
corresponding dummy argument has INTENT(INOUT).

The new intrinsic subroutine is

     EVENT_QUERY ( EVENT, COUNT [,STATUS] )

On a successful execution of EVENT_QUERY, COUNT is given the value of
the count of EVENT, and STATUS is given the value 0. On an
unsuccessful execution, STATUS is given a processor-dependent nonzero
value. An invocation does not constitute an image control statement.

During the execution of the program, the count of a event variable is
changed by the execution of EVENT POST and EVENT WAIT statements. If
the count of a event variable increases through the execution of an
EVENT POST statement on image M and later decreases through the
execution of an EVENT WAIT statement on image T, the segments
preceding the EVENT POST statement on image M precede the segments
following the EVENT WAIT statement on image T.

---------------------

----------------------------------

<<event variable>>
scalar variable of type EVENT_TYPE or LOCAL_EVENT_TYPE (6.2) from the
intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.


----------------------------------
[11] Replace this page by the following

6. Events

6.1 Introduction

An image can use an EVENT POST statement to notify another image that it
can proceed to work on tasks that use common resources.  An image can
wait on events posted by other images and can query if images have
posted events.

6.2 EVENT_TYPE and LOCAL_EVENT_TYPE

EVENT_TYPE and LOCAL_EVENT_TYPE are derived types with private
components. They are extensible types with no type parameters.  All
components have default initialization. EVENT_TYPE ond
LOCAL_EVENT_TYPE are defined in the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module.

A scalar variable of type EVENT_TYPE or LOCAL_EVENT_TYPE is an event
variable.  An event variable includes a count of the difference
between the number of successful posts and successful waits for the
event variable. The initial value of the event count of an event
variable is zero. The processor shall support a maximum value of the
event count of at least HUGE(0).

C601 A named variable of type EVENT_TYPE or LOCAL_EVENT_TYPE shall be
     a coarray. A named variable with a noncoarray subcomponent of
     type EVENT_TYPE or LOCAL_EVENT_TYEP shall be a coarray.

C602 An event variable shall not appear in a variable definition
     context except as the <event-variable> in a EVENT POST or EVENT
     WAIT statement, as an <allocate-object> in an ALLOCATE statement
     without a SOURCE= <alloc-opt> , or as an actual argument in a
     reference to a procedure with an explicit interface where the
     corresponding dummy argument has INTENT (INOUT).

C603 A variable with a subobject of type EVENT_TYPE or
     LOCAL_EVENT_TYPE shall not appear in a variable definition
     context, as an <allocate-object> in an ALLOCATE statement without
     a SOURCE= <alloc-opt> , or as an actual argument in a reference
     to a procedure with an explicit interface where the corresponding
     dummy argument has INTENT (INOUT).


Note:
  Event variables of type LOCAL_EVENT_TYPE are restricted so that
  EVENT WAIT statements can only wait on a local event variable.  This
  allows a more efficient implementation for this case. The more
  general case of waiting on an event variable on a any image requires
  the event variable to be of type EVENT_TYPE.


6.3 EVENT POST

The EVENT POST statement provides a way to post an event.

R601 <event-post-stmt> <<is>>  EVENT POST(<event-variable>  []
                               [] [, <sync-stat-list>] )

R602 <event-variable> <<is>> <scalar-variable>

C604 (R602) An <event-variable> shall be of the type EVENT_TYPE or
LOCAL_EVENT_TYPE defined in the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module.

A successful post to an event variable increments its count.  An
unsuccessful post does not change the count.


6.4 EVENT WAIT

The EVENT WAIT statement provides a way to wait until an event is
posted.

R603 <event-wait-stmt> <<is>>  EVENT WAIT(<event-variable> []
                               [] [, <sync-stat-list>] )

C605 (R603) The <event-variable> of type LOCAL_EVENT_TYPE shall not be
coindexed.

If the count of the <event-variable> is zero, the executing image
shall wait until the count is positive. A successful wait for an event
variable decrements its count. Unsuccessful waits shall not change the
count.

During the execution of the program, the count of a event variable is
changed by the execution of EVENT POST and EVENT WAIT statements. If
the count of a event variable increases through the execution of an
EVENT POST statement on image M and later decreases through the
execution of an EVENT WAIT statement on image T, the segments
preceding the EVENT POST statement on image M precede the segments
following the EVENT WAIT statement on image T.


 ----------------------------------
[17:44+] Add a new intrinsic subroutine

7.3.10a  EVENT_QUERY ( EVENT, COUNT [,STATUS] )

Description. Query the count of an event variable.

Class. 	Subroutine.

Arguments.

EVENT shall be scalar and of type EVENT_TYPE or LOCAL_EVENT_TYPE
      defined in the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module. It is an
      INTENT(IN) argument.

COUNT shall be scalar and of type default integer. It is an
      INTENT(OUT) argument. If the invocation is successful, COUNT
      becomes defined with the difference between the number of
      successful posts and successful waits for EVENT. Otherwise, it
      is given the value 0.

STATUS (optional) shall be scalar and of type default integer. It is
      an INTENT(OUT) argument. It becomes defined with value 0 if the
      invocation is successful and to a processor-defined nonzero
      value if the invocation is unsuccessful.

Example. If EVENT is an event variable for which there have been no
      successful posts or waits, after the invocation

          CALL EVENT_QUERY ( EVENT, COUNT )

      the integer variable COUNT has the value 0. If there have been
      10 successful posts and 2 successful waits to EVENT[2], after
      the invocation

          CALL EVENT_QUERY ( EVENT[2], COUNT )

      COUNT has the value 8.
