Subject: An Owner Computes Model for Co-Array Fortran
Reference: WG5 worklist item, Co-Array Fortran
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

When a serial program executes the following

  integer :: a       ! first example
  a = 0
  a = a + 1

the result is clear; the memory location represented by the
variable a contains the value 1.  Likewise, if a is a co-scalar,

  integer :: a[*]    ! second example
  a = 0
  a = a + 1

the result is again unambiguous; the memory location represented by
the variable a on each image will contain the value 1.  This is
equivalent (shorthand) to writing

  integer :: a[*]    ! third example
  a[me] = 0
  a[me] = a[me] + 1

where me is THIS_IMAGE.  Each of the above three examples follows
an owner computes model for the assignment operator.  While the
following,

  integer :: a[*]    ! fourth example
  a[1] = 0
  a[1] = a[1] + 1

may appear to be similar to the first three examples, it is radically
and surprisingly different.  In particular, it should be emphasized that
it is different from the serial execution in the first example.  In
the current Co-Array Fortran proposal, the fourth example follows
an all computes execution model, leads to race conditions, and is
therefore a non-conforming program.  The programmer must explicitly
state which image is to execute these two statements or use
a critical section construct.

It is proposed that Co-Array Fortran adopt an owner computes model
for the assignment operator.  Semantically it is as if there
were an if statement for every assignment, i.e.,

  if (me == 1) a[1] = a[2]

Since the owning image is the only image that can store to its memory,
there is no need for the critical construct for the assignment operator.

While not absolutely necessary, some algorithms are more conveniently
expressed (and require less synchronization) if a non-owning image is
allowed to store to a co-array variable.  However, because of the
possibility of dangerous race conditions (as noted above), it is
proposed that a different syntax be employed to denote both the
change from serial semantics and the dangerous aspects.  Perhaps the
two symbols <- could be used, for example,

  if (me == 2) a[1] <- a[2]

Advantages of the owner computes model:

1. Array-section notation may be specified in either the local or the
co-dimension, thus unifying its usage.  Currently array sections are not
allowed in the co-dimension.

2. If statements denying concurrent writes are not needed.  This makes the
initialization phase of a program more appealing, e.g.,

  if (me == 1) a[1] = 2; if (me == 2) a[2] = 1; ....

is not required.

3. The programmer does not need to be artificially aware of memory affinity.
The owner computes model allows the programmer to think of the co-dimension
as a memory address rather than an image index.

4. While get semantics (owner computes) is specified, the compiler is
free to choose whether a get or a put is most efficient for point-to-
point communication.  Currently in CAF, the programmer must choose which
image executes point-to-point communication and the programmer may guess
wrong (as the most efficient choice is hardware dependent).

5. Collective statements may be specified using section notation rather than
be explicitly coded.  In the current CAF specification, gather and allgather
collectives must be explicitly coded with if and do constructs.  It is
extremely important for the compiler to be able to recognize and optimize
collectives operations and it is likely easier for the compiler to
recognize a single collective statement rather than if and do constructs.
