1) Number: (TBD)

2) Title: TYPELESS objects in Fortran

3) Submitted By: J3

4) Status: For consideration

5) Basic Functionality:

Objects declared as TYPELESS have kind and rank attributes, but are
treated as only a sequence of bits, without the higher abstractions
associated with the traditional Fortran intrinsic types. A method for
declaring objects as TYPELESS is provided as well as rules on how such
objects interact with existing Fortran objects. Associated intrinsic
procedures are also provided.

6) Rationale:

Fortran currently lacks support for variables that represent a
sequence of bits independent of the interpretations imposed by the
traditional numeric, logical, and character data types. Various
features have been added to Fortran to facilitate handling sequences
of bits by overloading the INTEGER data type, and through vendor
extensions. This has lead to limitations in the usefulness of these
features as well as awkward wording in the Fortran standard text.
Adding a new intrinsic type specifier, TYPELESS, would simplify and
enhance the use of Fortran for certain types of non-numeric problems,
such as pattern matching, searching and sorting, and low level bit
manipulation, as well as allowing for more clarity in the text of the
standard. TYPELESS also provides a way to standardize several common
Fortran language extensions, and provides a rational method for
dealing with BOZ constants.


7) Estimated Impact:

Several edits to the standard would be required to incorporate this
feature, though each would be straightforward. Implementation of the
feature in compilers should be technically simple. It is rated as a 7
on the JKR scale.

8) Detailed Specification:

Discussion of typeless objects requires a concept of the size of an
object in number of bits. The term bit_size in lower case letters is
used in this proposal. The name BIT_SIZE in upper case letters refers
to the intrinsic function.

Declarations and constants 
--------------------------

The typeless type has values that are contiguous, ordered sequences of
bits. The bit_size is the number of bits in the sequence. A processor
shall provide typeless sizes with bit_size values corresponding to the
storage sizes of each of the INTEGER kinds provided, as well as the
storage sizes of twice and four times the size of the default INTEGER
storage size. Each provided bit_size is characterized by a value for a
type parameter called the kind type parameter. The kind type parameter
is of type default integer.  The kind type parameter of a typeless
object is returned by the intrinsic inquiry function KIND. The number
of bits of a typeless object is returned by the intrinsic function
BIT_SIZE. The intrinsic function SELECTED_TYPELESS_KIND returns a kind
value based on the specified number of bits.

The type specifier for the typeless type uses the keyword TYPELESS.

If the kind parameter is not specified, the default kind value is
KIND(TYPELESS(0)), and the type specified is default typeless.

Any typeless value may be represented as a <boz-literal-constant>.

(The f03 description of BOZ constants, [37:1-18], would be moved
to the typeless subsection of 4.4, and constraint C410 deleted.)

The digits of octal constants represent triples of bits, and the
digits of hexadecimal constants represent quartets of bits, according
to their numerical representations as binary integers, with leading
zero bits where needed. (Alternatively, a table of the translations
could be provided in the standard.)

A trailing <kind-param> is allowed for a BOZ constant.

A nonpointer scalar object of type default typeless occupies a single
numeric storage unit. The category of numeric sequence types is
expanded to include default typeless.

Assignment
----------

A typeless intrinsic assignment statement is an intrinsic assignment
statement for which the variable or the expression is typeless.
Intrinsic assignment of a typeless expression to a typeless, integer,
real, or complex variable of the same bit_size moves the bits from the
expression value to the variable without data conversions. Intrinsic
assignment of a typeless, integer, real, or complex expression to a
typeless variable of the same bit_size transfers the bits from the
expression value to the variable without data conversion. If the
expression value has a smaller bit_size than that of the variable, the
expression value is padded with bits of zero on the left so that the
bit_sizes are equal. If the expression value has a larger bit_size
than that of the variable, the expression value is truncated on the
left to the bit_size of the variable.

The typeless intrinsic assignment rules apply to data initializations
in declaration statements, DATA statements, and default component
initializations.

Note: Typeless assignment is not always the same as the result of the
TRANSFER intrinsic. The TRANSFER operation is based on the memory
image of the data, while typeless assignment is based on the data
values.  For example, if S is an 32-bit integer array of size 8, and R
is a 64-bit typeless array of size 8, R = TRANSFER(S,R) will result in
the values of S packed into the first 4 elements of R.  The way in
which this packing is done will be different on little endian and big
endian machines.  The typeless assignment, R = S, will result in all 8
elements of R being defined, where R(i) contains the bits from S(i) in
the lower 32 bits, and 0 in the upper 32 bits.  Typeless assignment
does not depend on which endian the processors memory system uses.


Intrinsic operations 
--------------------

The .and., .or., .xor., and .not. operators are defined for typeless
operands. .xor. is the exclusive or operation.  The computations are
bitwise operations. The result of the expression evaluation is
typeless.  If the operands are of unequal bit_size, the smaller is
padded on the left with zero bits before the operation is performed.

Optional feature: Extend the use of .and., .or., .xor., and .not. to
                  integer, real, and complex operands, with an implied 
                  cast of those operands to typeless before the 
                  operation is performed.

The .eq., .ne., .lt., .le., .gt., .ge., ==, /=, <, <=, >, and >=
operators are defined for typeless operands.  If the operands are of
unequal KIND, the smaller is padded on the left with zero bits before
the operation is performed. Operands A and B are equal if their
corresponding bits are the same, and are unequal otherwise. If A and B
are unequal, and the leftmost unequal corresponding bit of A is 1 and
of B is 0, then A > B, otherwise A < B.  

Optional feature: Extend the above relational operators to the case
                  where one operand is typeless and the other is real,
                  integer, or complex, with an implied cast of the
                  operand that is not typeless to typeless before the
                  operation is performed.

The numeric intrinsic operations are not defined for typeless
objects. To use a typeless object as an operand of a numeric intrinsic
operator, it must first be cast to an appropriate type with a type
conversion intrinsic function. The type conversion functions are
described later.


Formatted Input and Output 
--------------------------

The format specifiers for typeless objects are I, B, O, and Z. For
output, if the .d part of the Bw.d, Ow.d, or Zw.d specifier is
omitted, the value assumed for d is >= 1 and large enough to represent
the bits in the io list item excluding leading 0 bits.  For the I
format specifier, the object value is interpreted as an unsigned base
10 integer.  For input using the B, O, and Z edit descriptors, the
character string shall consist of binary, octal, or hexadecimal digits
in the respective input field. For input using the I format, the input
character string shall consist of an unsigned decimal integer.

For list directed output, the format used is Zw.d where d is (bit_size
of the io list item + 3)/4 and w = d+1. For list directed input,
hexadecimal constants are valid for typeless io list items. The number
of bits required to represent the input value shall be less than or
equal to the bit_size of the corresponding io list item. If it is
less, the io list item is padded with zero bits on the left.


Procedure actual and dummy arguments and pointers
-------------------------------------------------

Two objects have "compatible kind parameters" if they have the same
bit_sizes.

TYPELESS pointers can point to targets with compatible kind
parameters.

TYPELESS dummy arguments of non-intrinsic procedures are compatible with
actual arguments having compatible kind parameters.

Note: This feature can significantly simplify the interfaces for
procedures that move data in memory, but do not perform any operations
on the data. Classic examples include dusty-deck codes containing MOVE
or COPY routines, as well as some MPI library routines written in C with
dummy arguments of type void.


Modification of existing language intrinsics:
---------------------------------------------

Section 13.3 of the standard, describing Bit Models, is modified to
apply to typeless quantities. The specifications for several intrinsic
procedures are modified to allow typeless actual arguments. Several of
these have result values described in terms of the bit model in
section 13.3. Minimal changes would be needed in those cases.

The I argument of ACHAR shall be of type integer or typeless. If I is
typeless, it is interpreted as an unsigned integer value.

The I argument of BIT_SIZE shall be of type integer or typeless. 

The I argument of CHAR shall be of type integer or typeless. If I is
typeless, it is interpreted as an unsigned integer value.

The X and Y arguments of CMPLX shall be of type integer, real,
complex, or typeless. Note that typeless is a generalization and
replacement for the current "or a <boz-literal-constant>".

The A arguments of DBLE shall be of type integer, real, complex, or
typeless. Note that typeless is a generalization and replacement for
the current "or a <boz-literal-constant>".

The X argument of HUGE shall be of type integer, real, or typeless.
If X is typeless, the result value has all bits set to 1.

The I and J arguments of IAND, IEOR, and IOR shall be of type integer
or typeless, and have the same bit_size. The result is of type integer
if one of the arguments is integer, and typeless otherwise.

The I argument of BTEST, IBCLR, IBITS, and IBSET shall be of type
integer or typeless.

The A argument of INT shall be of type integer, real, complex, or
typeless. Note that typeless is a generalization and replacement for
the current "or a <boz-literal-constant>". If A is typeless, the
result value is that of an intrinsic assignment of A to an integer
variable of the specified KIND.

The I arguments of ISHFT and ISHFTC shall be of type integer or
typeless.

The X argument of KIND is specified as "any intrinsic type", so no
change is needed.

The A* arguments of MAX and MIN shall be of type integer, real,
character, or typeless. If the arguments are typeless, the meaning of
"largest" in the result value description is as specified by the >
operator for typeless values.

The ARRAY arguments of MAXLOC, MINLOC, MAXVAL, and MINVAL shall be of
type integer, real, character, or typeless.

The FROM and TO arguments of MVBITS shall be of type integer or
typeless.

The I argument of NOT shall be of type integer or typeless.

The A argument of REAL shall be of type integer, real, complex, or
typeless. Note that typeless is a generalization and replacement for
the current "or a <boz-literal-constant>". If A is typeless, the
result value is that of an intrinsic assignment of A to a real
variable of the specified KIND.

Possible modifications to other intrinsic procedures:
-----------------------------------------------------

Several other intrinsic functions could be reasonably extended to
allow typeless arguments. 

Changes to PRODUCT, SUM, DOT_PRODUCT, and MATMUL should be included or
omitted from the proposal as a group.

PRODUCT: The result value is an .and. reduction of the specified
elements of the typeless ARRAY argument.

SUM: The result value is an .xor. reduction of the specified elements
of the typeless ARRAY argument.

DOT_PRODUCT: The result value is SUM(VECTOR_A .and. VECTOR_B) for
typeless arguments VECTOR_A and VECTOR_B.

MATMUL: The value of each result element is SUM(MATRIX_A( )
.and. MATRIX_B( )) where the argument subscripts are as specified for
the other argument types, and MATRIX_A and MATRIX_B are typeless. Note
that this is not the same as bit-matrix-multiply operation.  That
could be added as a separate pair of intrinsics (for the .or. and
.xor. variants), but it is not currently part of the typeless
proposal.

The RANDOM_NUMBER subroutine could allow a typeless HARVEST argument
which would return with a value consisting of a random pattern of
bits.


New intrinsic functions:
------------------------

SELECTED_TYPELESS_KIND(Z)  : Result: default scalar integer 
                             Z  : scalar integer

Z is a number of bits. The returned KIND value is that of the smallest
typeless kind that can contain Z bits. If no kind is provided for the
requested value of Z, the result is -1.

Note: The default typeless kind is SELECTED_TYPELESS_KIND(BIT_SIZE(0))


TYPELESS(A[,KIND]) : Result: typeless 
                   A     : integer, real, complex, or typeless 
                   KIND  : integer initialization expression

The result is a typeless value with the same bit pattern as the
argument A, possible padded with zero bits on the left, or truncated
on the left if the bit_sizes of A and the result are not equal.
TYPELESS is an elemental function, and it cannot be passed as an
actual argument.  If KIND is present, the kind type parameter of the
result is that specified by the value of KIND; otherwise the kind type
parameter of the result is that of default typeless.



POPCNT(I)   : Result: integer, in range [0..bit_size(I)] 
              I     : typeless or integer

The result is the number of bits set to 1 in the argument. This
function is adopted from HPF and extended to allow typeless
arguments. POPCNT is an elemental function, and it cannot be passed as
an actual argument.  If I is integer, the result KIND is the same as
that of I. If I is typeless, the result KIND is that of an integer
with the same bit_size as the argument.

POPPAR(I)   : Result: integer, 0 or 1 
              I     : typeless or integer

The result is 0 if the number of bits set to 1 in the argument is
even, and 1 if the number of bits set to 1 in the argument is odd.
This function is adopted from HPF and extended to allow typeless
arguments. POPPAR is an elemental function, and it cannot be passed as
an actual argument.  If I is integer, the result KIND is the same as
that of I. If I is typeless, the result KIND is that of an integer
with the same bit_size as the argument.

LEADZ(I)    : Result: integer, in range [0..bit_size(I)] 
              I     : typeless or integer
              
The result is the number of leading 0 bits in the argument.  This
function is adopted from HPF and extended to allow typeless
arguments. LEADZ is an elemental function, and it cannot be passed as
an actual argument.  If I is integer, the result KIND is the same as
that of I. If I is typeless, the result KIND is that of an integer
with the same bit_size as the argument.

TRAILZ(I)   : Result: integer, in range [0..bit_size(I)]
              I     : typeless or integer

The result is the number of trailing 0 bits in the argument.  TRAILZ
is an elemental function, and it cannot be passed as an actual
argument.  If I is integer, the result KIND is the same as that of
I. If I is typeless, the result KIND is that of an integer with the
same bit_size as the argument.


SHIFTL(I,SHIFT) : Result: typeless 
                  I     : typeless or integer 
                  SHIFT : integer, >= 0

The result is the value I shifted left by SHIFT bits, with 0 bits
filled on the right. If SHIFT > BIT_SIZE(I), the result is
zero. SHIFTL is an elemental function, and it cannot be passed as an
actual argument. If I is typeless, the result KIND is the same as that
of I. If I is integer, the result KIND is that of a typeless value
with the same bit_size as the argument.


SHIFTR(I,SHIFT) : Result: typeless 
                  I     : typeless or integer 
                  SHIFT : integer, >= 0

The result is the value I shifted right by SHIFT bits, with 0 bits
filled on the left. If SHIFT > BIT_SIZE(I), the result is
zero. SHIFTR is an elemental function, and it cannot be passed as an
actual argument. If I is typeless, the result KIND is the same as that
of I. If I is integer, the result KIND is that of a typeless value
with the same bit_size as the argument.


SHIFTA(I,SHIFT) : Result: typeless 
                  I     : typeless or integer 
                  SHIFT : integer, >= 0

The result is the value I shifted right by SHIFT bits, with copies of
the leftmost bit filled on the left. If SHIFT > BIT_SIZE(I), the
result is zero if the leftmost bit of I is 0, or HUGE(TYPELESS(I)) if
the leftmost bit of I is 1. SHIFTA is an elemental function, and it
cannot be passed as an actual argument. If I is typeless, the result
KIND is the same as that of I. If I is integer, the result KIND is
that of a typeless value with the same bit_size as the argument.


DSHIFTL(I,J,SHIFT) : Result: typeless 
                     I     : typeless or integer 
                     J     : same type and kind as I 
                     SHIFT : integer, 0 <= SHIFT <= BIT_SIZE(I)

The result is the value of I shifted left by SHIFT bits, with the
rightmost SHIFT bits of I replaced by the leftmost SHIFT bits of
J. This is equivalent to concatenating I and J, shifting the combined
value left SHIFT bits, and keeping the left half.  If I and J are the
same, the result is the same as a left circular shift. DSHIFTL is an
elemental function, and it cannot be passed as an actual argument. If
I is typeless, the result KIND is the same as that of I.  If I is
integer, the result KIND is that of a typeless value with the same
bit_size as the argument.

DSHIFTR(I,J,SHIFT) : Result: typeless 
                     I     : typeless or integer 
                     J     : same type and kind as I 
                     SHIFT : integer, 0 <= SHIFT <= BIT_SIZE(I)

The result is the value of J shifted right by SHIFT bits, and the
leftmost SHIFT bits of J replaced by the rightmost SHIFT bits of
I. This is equivalent to concatenating I and J, shifting the combined
value right SHIFT bits, and keeping the right half.  If I and J are
the same, the result is the same as a right circular shift. DSHIFTR is
an elemental function, and it cannot be passed as an actual
argument. If I is typeless, the result KIND is the same as that of I.
If I is integer, the result KIND is that of a typeless value with the
same bit_size as the argument.


MASKL(I[,KIND])  : Result: typeless 
                   I     : integer, in range [0..bit_size(result)]
                   KIND  : integer initialization expression


The result is a typeless value with the leftmost I bits set to 1 and
the remaining bits set to 0. The value of I shall be >= 0 and <= the
bit_size of the result.  MASKL is an elemental function, and it cannot
be passed as an actual argument.  If KIND is present, the kind type
parameter of the result is that specified by the value of KIND;
otherwise the kind type parameter of the result is that of default
typeless.


MASKR(I[,KIND] ) : Result: typeless 
                   I     : integer, in range [0..bit_size(result)]
                   KIND  : integer initialization expression


The result is a typeless value with the rightmost I bits set to 1 and
the remaining bits set to 0. The value of I shall be >= 0 and <= the
bit_size of the result.  MASKL is an elemental function, and it cannot
be passed as an actual argument.  If KIND is present, the kind type
parameter of the result is that specified by the value of KIND;
otherwise the kind type parameter of the result is that of default
typeless.


MERGE_BITS(I,J,MASK) : Result: typeless 
                       I     : typeless 
                       J     : typeless, same kind as I 
                       MASK  : typeless, same kind as I 
                       
The result of a typeless value with bits from I if the corresponding
bits in MASK are 1 and the bits from J if the corresponding bits in
MASK are 0.  Equivalent to (I .and. MASK) .or. (J .and. (.not. MASK))
MERGE_BITS is an elemental function, and it cannot be passed as an
actual argument. The kind type parameter of the result is the same as
the kind type parameter of I.


Interoperation with C:
----------------------

Typeless objects interoperate with C objects of the same bit_size,
including C unsigned integer objects. If a typeless object is the
actual argument corresponding to an unsigned integer dummy argument of
a C function, or the unsigned integer result of a C function is
assigned to a typeless variable, the I format can be used to output
the correct form of the C value.
