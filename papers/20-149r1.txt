NUMBER: F18/0020
TITLE: Multiple allocate/deallocate of same object
KEYWORDS: ALLOCATE DEALLOCATE
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Consider

  Program test
    Integer,Alloctable :: aa(:)
    Integer,Pointer :: p(:)
    Allocate(aa(10),aa(10),Stat=istat) ! (A)
    Print *,istat
    Deallocate(aa,aa,Stat=istat) ! (B)
    Print *,istat
    Allocate(p(10),p(20)) ! (C)
    Print *,Shape(p)
    Deallocate(p,p,Stat=istat) ! (D)
    Print *,istat
  End Program

The standard says that an allocate-object cannot depend on another
allocate-object, whether in ALLOCATE or DEALLOCATE. See
[133:22-24] 9.7.1.1 Form of the ALLOCATE statement, paragraph two, and
[136:21-23] 9.7.3.1 Form of the DEALLOCATE statement, paragraph two.


Thus, it could be argued that all the statements with comments are
invalid (not conforming).

However, AA does not depend on AA; it *is* AA. Similarly P. The
semantics specified by the standard seem to be unambiguous, even
though there is no ordering specified for the allocations and
deallocations:
    (A) causes the variable AA to become allocated, and raises an
        error condition assigning a non-zero value to ISTAT due to
        attempting to ALLOCATE an already-allocated ALLOCATABLE.
        As the bounds are the same, there is not even any dependency
        on the allocation ordering.
    (B) causes the variable AA to become deallocated, and raises an
        error condition assigning a non-zero value to ISTAT due to
        attmpting to DEALLOCATE an unallocated ALLOCATABLE.
    (C) causes the variable P to become allocated, twice, probably
        "leaking" the memory from one allocation. After execution
        of the statement, the shape of P will be [ 10 ] or [ 20 ].
    (D) causes the variable P to become disassociated, and raises an
        error condition attempting to DEALLOCATE a disassociated
        pointer.

Q. Is the program conforming, with the results specified above?

As a supplementary consideration, what about variables that are not
the same but are associated? For example, ENTRY result variables are
associated with the FUNCTION result, and an allocatable or pointer
component of an associate-name is associated with the corresponding
component of a selector if the selector is a variable,

ANSWER:

A. No, the program was not intended to be conforming; the word
   "depend" was intended to include the cases of the variable being
   the same (or associated), even in cases where there can be no
   dependency as such. An edit is supplied to clarify this.

DISCUSSION:

Although it is indeed arguable that the program is conforming, it seems
clear enough that this was not intended. As further evidence, it would
make the result processor-dependent in some cases, and is not listed in
the Annex of processor dependencies.
