Subject: US 12, arrays of coarrays, MOLD= in ALLOCATE
Date: 2021-October-22
Reference: 21-007r2

Discussion
----------

If a non-coarray <allocate-object> of unlimited-polymorphic type were
allowed to be allocated to have a dynamic type with a coarray ultimate
component its deallocation would be an image control statement. It was
intended to disallow this because it is undesirable to have a data
value determine whether a statement is an image control statement.

For the ALLOCATE statement, the constraint
   C953 (R932) The declared type of <source-expr> shall not have a
   coarray ultimate component.
applies both to MOLD= and SOURCE= and ensures that an unlimited-
polymorphic <allocate-object> is not given a dynamic type with a
coarray ultimate component in this way but there is no comparable
constraint for <type-spec>. Such a constraint is not needed for a
polymorphic <allocate-object> with a declared type that has a coarray
ultimate component and the constraint on MOLD= is not needed in this
case either.

I propose moving the SOURCE= part of C953 to C952, deleting the MOLD=
part of C953 and adding this restriction:
"If an <allocate-object> is unlimited polymorphic, the dynamic type of
neither <type-spec> nor <source-expr> shall have a coarray ultimate
component." It is a runtime restriction so it cannot be a constraint
but can be normative.

-----------------

[142:27,30] In 9.7.1.1 Form of the ALLOCATE statement, in C952 after
"not" add "have a coarray ultimate component," so that the constraint
becomes
"C952 (R929) If SOURCE= appears, the declared type of <source-expr>
shall not have a coarray ultimate component, be EVENT_TYPE, LOCK_TYPE,
or NOTIFY_TYPE from the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV, or have a
potential subobject component of type EVENT_TYPE, LOCK_TYPE or
NOTIFY_TYPE."
Delete "C953 (R932) The declared type of <source-expr> shall not have
a coarray ultimate component."

[143:12] In 9.7.1.1 Form of the ALLOCATE statement, at the end of
para 5 add "If an <allocate-object> is unlimited polymorphic, the
dynamic type of neither <type-spec> nor <source-expr> shall have a
coarray ultimate component."
