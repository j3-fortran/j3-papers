Discussion

Comment GB3 in WG5/N1881 asks for a note in 2.4.2 "with an explanation
of asynchronous communication and an example illustrating it". Here is
a suggestion for that note.

At the end of 2.4.2 of WG5/N1869 (page 5) add

"NOTE 2.5
Asynchronous communication can be used for nonblocking MPI calls such
as MPI_IRECV and MPI_ISEND.  For example,
    REAL :: BUF(100,100)
       ... ! Code that involves BUF
    BLOCK
      ASYNCHRONOUS :: BUF
      CALL MPI_IRECV(BUF,...REQ,...)
         ... ! Code that does not involve BUF
      CALL MPI_WAIT(REQ,...)
    END BLOCK
       ... ! Code that involves BUF
In this example, there is asynchronous input communication and BUF is a
pending communication affector between the two calls. MPI_IRECV may
return while the communication (reading values into BUF) is still
underway.  The intent is that the code between MPI_IRECV and MPI_WAIT
executes without waiting for this communication to complete. The
restrictions are the same as for asynchronous data transfer input.

Similar code with the call of MPI_IRECV replaced by a call of MPI_ISEND
is asynchronous output communication. The restrictions are the same as
for asynchronous data transfer output."
