NUMBER: F08/0061
TITLE: Description of the CONTIGUOUS attribute misworded?
KEYWORDS: CONTIGUOUS
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

Consider the following code:

module mod_cont
contains
  subroutine fcont(x)
    real, contiguous :: x(:)
    integer :: i
    x = (/ (real(i),i=1,size(x)) /)
  end subroutine fcont
end module mod_cont
program cont
  use mod_cont
  implicit none
  real :: x(45)

  call fcont(x(1::3))

end program

Is this program standard conforming?

5.3.7 paragraph 1 says:

"The CONTIGUOUS attribute specifies that an assumed-shape array can
 only be argument associated with a contiguous effective argument, or
 that an array pointer can only be pointer associated with a
 contiguous target."


ANSWER:

Yes.  The effect of the CONTIGUOUS attribute is misstated.  An edit
is supplied to correct this.

EDITS for 10-007r1:

[93:7-8] In 5.3.7p1,
  Change
   "can only be argument associated with a contiguous effective
    argument"
  to
   "is contiguous".

ADDITIONAL SUGGESTED EDIT FOR A FUTURE REVISION:

[93:30+] In 5.3.7 after Note 5.10, insert additional note
  "NOTE 5.10a
   If an actual argument is not simply contiguous and the
   corresponding dummy argument is an assumed-shape array with the
   CONTIGUOUS attribute, the processor might use copy-in/copy-out to
   assure the contiguity of the dummy argument."
