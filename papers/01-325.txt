Subj: Section 15.2.6 Edits

Section and page/line numbers are from 01-007R2


1) The restriction in [362:1-3] is too severe.  An interface for a
generic procedure requires an explicit interface for each of the
specific procedures that can be referenced through the generic
name. It is important to allow the specific procedures to be
written in C. Generic interfaces to MPI routines are significant
examples.
The current wording in [362:1-3] does not allow BIND(C) for a
procedure which would otherwise require an explicit interface,
including the requirement of the explicit interface to be part of a
generic interface.  We believe this was not intended.  An explicit
interface is required for the reasons listed in section 12.3.1.1
[239:15-34]. The reasons listed in item (1) [239:17-22] should be
allowed in combination with BIND(C).


Edit:

[362:2-3] Replace "for any reason other than the presence of the
                   <language-binding-spec>"
          With    "for any of the reasons listed in 12.3.1.1
(2-4).


2) In Note 15.19, the print statement in [362:31] outputs the whole
DIGIT_ARR, including element 10. The most likely assumption about how
the (missing) COPY routine works would result in DIGIT_ARR(10) having
the value of the C null character.  This character should not be
included as part of the characters printed.

Edit:

[362:31] Replace "DIGIT_ARR" with "DIGIT_ARR(1:9)"
