NUMBER: F03/0084
TITLE:  IEEE_SET_ROUNDING_MODE in a subroutine
DEFECT TYPE: CLARIFICATION/ERRATUM
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Section 7.1.8.1 says that if the value of an
expression can be determined before execution
of the program, it is standard-conforming to use
the predetermined value.

Consider the subprogram

        SUBROUTINE S()
        USE, INTRINSIC :: IEEE_ARITHMETIC
        USE, INTRINSIC :: IEEE_FEATURES

        INTEGER, PARAMETER :: sp = IEEE_SELECTED_REAL_KIND(6,30)
        real(sp) :: X = 0.5559013_sp
        real(sp) :: Y = 1.2092481_sp
        real(sp) :: Z
        IF (IEEE_SUPPORT_ROUNDING(IEEE_NEAREST,X) .AND. &
            IEEE_SUPPORT_ROUNDING(IEEE_UP,X)) THEN
            Z1 = X*Y
            CALL IEEE_SET_ROUNDING_MODE(IEEE_NEAREST)
            Z2 = X*Y
            PRINT *, 'Residual: ', Z1 - Z2
        ENDIF
        END

(1) Is a processor permitted always to print zero for the residual Z1 - Z2 ?
(2) Same question, after giving X and Y the PARAMETER attribute.

ANSWER:

(1) No, for a high quality implementation.
Given that the processor supports execution with both
rounding modes IEEE_NEAREST and IEEE_UP, this subprogram
might be executed in either rounding mode (since the rounding
mode is inherited from the caller, see [367:20-22]), and the value
zero is a bad approximation in the latter case.

No edits are necessary.

(2) Yes.  In this case "X*Y" is an initialization expression,  whose value does
not change from one appearance to the next.

EDITS:

Note 14.6 should note additionally that the value of an
initialization expression is not affected by changes in the rounding mode.
