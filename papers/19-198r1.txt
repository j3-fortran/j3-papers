Subject: Add reductions to DO CONCURRENT (US20)
Date: 2019-August-06

Reference: 18-007r1, 18-266r4, 19-158

Motivation
==========

Performing a reduction on the array elements computed
in DO CONCURRENT can be inefficient for large arrays.
The naive expression of a reduction is non-conforming:

        real :: a(:)
        real :: s
        integer :: i

        ...

        ! With DO CONCURRENT, the use of 's' in the
        ! loop below is not defined before it is referenced.
        s = 0
        do concurrent (i = 1:size(a))
          s = s + (2 * a(i) - 1)
        end do

        print *, s
        end

Potential solutions using temporary arrays (used to
accumulate intermediate results) followed by REDUCE are
inefficient in the use of data and the potential data
management required in highly threaded environments.

When the programmer is interested in performing a simple
reduction of the data in the DO CONCURRENT, this overhead
can exceed the gains from the computational parallelism.

Also, with knowledge of the reduction, a processor could optimize
DO CONCURRENT to be scaled to the number of threads available
at runtime (the number of which may not be known to the
programmer), chunking computations.

At meeting 218, J3 approved continued work on this item.

Note that this paper only describes REDUCE for scalar variables.
Once we get the semantics of that right we can expand this to
cover REDUCE on non-scalar variables.

Simple Use Cases
================

    ! With current semantics, the code below is not
    ! conformant. 's' is not defined in the iteration
    ! before it is referenced.
    s = 1000
    DO CONCURRENT (i = 1:SIZE(a))
      s = s + (2 * a(i) - 1)
    END DO
    ! s = 1000 + SUM(2*A-1)

    ! Likewise, with 'foo', not defined before used.
    foo = a(1)
    DO CONCURRENT (i = 2:SIZE(a))
      foo = MIN(foo, a(i))
    END DO
    ! foo = MINVAL(a)

We would like programs with semantics similar to the above to be
conformant and still be able to exploit all available runtime
parallelism.


Requirements
============

Provide Fortran support for some of the features of the OpenMP
reduction clause on numeric and logical intrinsic types.

The proposal should support:
    1. Extend DO CONCURRENT to include the addition of scalar
       "reduction variables" and corresponding "reduction operators"
       on the reduction variables.

    2. Allow multiple reduction variables to be defined for a
       DO CONCURRENT.

    3. Support intrinsic binary and n-ary operators as reduction
       operators:
           + * .AND. .OR. .EQV. .NEQV. MIN MAX IAND IOR IEOR

    4. Provide for the initialization of the reduction variables
       consistent with the reduction operators.

    5. Have reduction variable semantics aligned with existing
       locality specifications for DO CONCURRENT.

    6. Have behavior that is a good analog to the OpenMP reduction
       clause.


The proposal need not support:
    1. Reduction variables with the ALLOCATABLE, POINTER,
       INTENT (IN), or OPTIONAL attribute.


Proposal
========
Add a new locality-spec to describe reduction variables. These
reduction variables are local to each iteration of the loop,
initialized with a suitable value upon entry to the loop, but are
related to a defined instance of the reduction variable in the
scope outside the loop.

This proposal is limited to scalar reduction variables of numeric
type. In the future, we may consider extending this proposal to
include
    - reduction variables of arrays of numeric type;
    - reduction variables of derived types;
    - additional intrinsic operators and procedures
    - user-defined PURE functions as operators;
    - operators and procedures of derived types.

Syntax change for locality-spec:
    R1129  locality-spec is LOCAL ( variable-name-list )
                         or LOCAL_INIT ( variable-name-list )
                         or SHARED ( variable-name-list )
                         or DEFAULT ( NONE )
                         or REDUCE (reduce-op : reduce-var-name-list)

Define a limited set of binary operators and procedures that can
be used to combine values of the reduction variables.

Syntax for the binary operators and procedures:
    R1129a  reduce-op is binary-reduce-op
                            or function-reduce-op

    R1129b  binary-reduce-op is +
                            or *
                            or .AND.
                            or .OR.
                            or .EQV.
                            or .NEQV.

    R1129c  function-reduce-op is MIN
                            or MAX
                            or IAND
                            or IOR
                            or IEOR

Add a rule to define reduction variable names
    R1129d  reduce-var-name is scalar-variable-name

Add constraints for the reduction variables:
    - it must be scalar
    - it must not be a pointer
    - it must not be allocatable
    - it must not be an optional dummy argument that is not present
    - it must be permitted to appear in a variable definition context

Limit the definition and use of reduction variables in each
iteration to make the implementation less complex. Allow
variations on
  var = var op expression
  var = expression op var
  var = function (var, expression)
  var = function (expression, var)
for suitable values of op and function.

Upon start of an iteration, the reduction variables
are given default initial values based on the reduction
operator, type and kind of the variable. Table T1 below
summarizes these for the operators defined above.

Upon completion of the DO CONCURRENT, the value of each
reduction variable is as if the  value of the reduction
variable before execution of the loop combined (via the
reduction operator) with the values of the reduction variable
from each iteration of the DO CONCURRENT. This combination
could be performed in any order.

The processor may make assumptions about how to parallelize the
DO CONCURRENT iterations  to optimize or eliminate synchronized
access to each reduction variables.

            Table T1. The types of the allowed operands
                      and default initial values for
                      each reduction operator and procedure.
                      The types use the type designators used
                      found in Table 10.2.

      OPERATOR          INITIAL VALUE         ALLOWED TYPES

      .EQV.                .TRUE.                    L
      .NEQV.               .FALSE.                   L
       MIN                 nnlmsbtp *              I, R
       MAX                 pnlmsbtp **             I, R
       IAND                 NOT(0)                   I
       IOR                    0                      I
       IEOR                   0                      I

  * nnlmsbtp = the value of the negative number of the largest
    magnitude supported by the processor for numbers of the type
    and kind of the reduction variable.

 ** pnlmsbtp = the value of the positive number of the largest
    magnitude supported by the processor for numbers of the type
    and kind of the reduction variable.


Revisited Use Cases
===================
    s = 1000
    DO CONCURRENT (i = 1:size(a)) REDUCE(+:s)
      s = s + (2 * a(i) - 1)
    END DO

    foo = a(1)
    DO CONCURRENT (i = 2:size(a)) REDUCE(MIN: foo)
      foo = MIN(foo, a(i))
    END DO


Benefits
========
Adding REDUCE will:
    - Increase the usefulness of DO CONCURRENT
    - Increase opportunities to exploit SIMD and other parallelism
    - Increase ability to optimize parallelism according to the
      available threads
    - Make it easier to write conforming programs
    - Make it easier to check the programmer's intent about reductions
    - Reduce memory allocation needs or explicit data management when
      offloading to target processors
    - Eliminate explicit synchronization
    - Reduce need for explicit temporaries


Questions
=========
1. Should we remove the restriction on forms of use
   of the reduction variable in the loop iterations?
      var = var op expression
      var = expression op var
      var = function (var, expression)
      var = function (expression, var)
