Subject:   Coarray teams
Date: 2013 February 1
Reference: WG5/N1883, WG5/N1930, 12-201

1. Discussion
-------------

This paper proposes syntax and semantics for coarray teams.


2. Requirements (copied from N1930)
-----------------------------------

Teams provide a capability to restrict the image set of remote memory
references, coarray allocations, and synchronizations to a subset of
all the images of the program. This simplifies writing programs that
involve segregated activities (parts of a climate model, for example)
that might be more easily be written independently or may have already
been written as independent programs. Teams also provide a mechanism
for subdividing the computation for the sake of better performance
(such as within local SMP domains). Finally, teams provide the
capability to execute procedures (such as library procedures) that use
coarrays internally on a subset of the images of a program.

T1: When a block of code is executed on images executing as a team, it
    should execute on those images as if the program contained no
    other images. This has the following implications:

    1. Image indices shall be relative to the team, starting at 1 and
       ending with the number of images in the team.

    2. Collective activities that would involve all images, such as
       SYNC ALL, allocation and deallocation of coarrays, collective
       subroutine execution, and inquiry intrinsics such as THIS_IMAGE
       and NUM_IMAGES shall be relative to the team.

T2: While an image executes a statement it shall be a member of one
    and only one team. Access to variables on images outside the
    current team is not permitted.

T3: It should be possible to split a team into mutually exclusive
    subsets that are themselves teams. This should be dynamic in order
    to allow different groupings of images during different stages of
    execution. It is desirable to have a compact mechanism for an
    image to specify which team it wishes to belong.

T4: There shall be a construct mechanism for changing the current
    team, involving the synchronization of all members of the teams
    at the beginning and end of the construct. The construct shall
    support separate execution blocks based on team membership. The
    construct shall make apparent (both to the system and the
    programmer) where team execution begins and ends.

T5: There shall be a type for variables identifying a team collection
    (probably an opaque derived type defined in the intrinsic module
    ISO_FORTRAN_ENV).

T6: There needs to be a mechanism to find the image index relative to
    the set of an ancestor team. This might best be done by adding an
    optional argument to IMAGE_INDEX that specifies the ancestor team.

T7: An allocatable coarray that is allocated within a team construct
    shall be deallocated before execution of the team construct
    terminates.  An coarray that was allocated in a parent team shall
    not be deallocated within an child team construct.

T8: The restriction that standard input is attached only to image 1 is
    unchanged, and the designated image is image 1 of the original set
    of images present at program startup.


3. Modifications to the requirements

We have kept to the requirements except as follows

T4. We do not provide explicit syntax for separate execution blocks
based on team membership because this can easily be programmed with
existing constructs, as is illustrated in an example.

T6. An extension of THIS_IMAGE is the natural way to achieve this aim.

T9. We have added facilities for the support of failed images. This
addition needs consideration by WG5.


4. Syntax and Semantics
--------------------

The derived type TEAMS_TYPE is defined in the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic
module. Its components are private; no component is allocatable or a
pointer. It is an extensible type with no type parameters.

A variable of type TEAMS_TYPE is a teams variable. A teams variable
shall be a coarray and shall not appear in a variable definition
context except as an argument to the intrinsic subroutine FORM_TEAMS
or as an <allocate-object> in an ALLOCATE statement that does not have
a SOURCE= specifier.

Every image of the program begins execution as part of the
root team. At any point during execution of the program an
image shall be part of one and only one team. That team is the current
team. The result of the NUM_IMAGES() intrinsic function is the number
of images in the current team. The image index values for images of
the current team are in the set 1..NUM_IMAGES().

An intrinsic collective subroutine called FORM_TEAMS is provided.

The intrinsic function COLOR provides the value of the argument COLOR
in the call from the executing image of the subroutine FORM_TEAMS that
formed the current team.

The current team to which the execution image belongs is changed by
execution of a CHANGE TEAM construct.

A new named constant, STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, is defined in the
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module.  It shall have a nonzero value that
is different from the value of STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE, STAT_LOCKED,
STAT_LOCKED_OTHER_IMAGE, or STAT_UNLOCKED. The value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE
becomes the value of the variable in a STAT= specifier, or STAT
argument, in an image control statement if execution of the statement
involves synchronization with, or accessing a variable on an image of
the current team that has failed. A failed image is one for which
references or definitions of data fail when that data should be
accessible, or the image fails to respond as part of a collective
activity.  What constitutes a failed image is processor dependent, but
usually is associated with a hardware failure of the processor, memory
system, or interconnection network.

The intrinsic function FAILED_IMAGES() provides the values of the
image indices for the images in the current team that have failed.

The intrinsic function THIS_IMAGE() is extended to have an optional
argument TEAM. The TEAM argument shall be a team variable for an
ancestor team of the current team. The result value is the image index
of the executing image in that team. The intrinsic function
THIS_IMAGE(COARRAY [, DIM]) is not extended.

The intrinsic function NUM_IMAGES() is extended to have optional
arguments TEAM and FAILED. The TEAM argument shall be a team variable
for an ancestor team of the current team. The result value is the
number of images in that team. If FAILED is absent, the total number
of images is returned. If FAILED is present with the value true, the
number of failed images is returned. If FAILED is present with the
value false, the total number of images that have not failed is
returned.

The constant ROOT_TEAM of type TEAMS_TYPE describes the root team.
Its use is restricted to the argument TEAM of either of the intrinsics
NUM_IMAGES and THIS_IMAGE.

Access to the standard input unit is available only on the image
that has image index 1 in the root team.

5. Teams of images

5.1 Introduction

A team of images is a set of images that access each other's data. The
current team is the team that includes the executing image. All images
indices are relative to the current team and data on images outside
this team are inaccessible. Initially, the current team consists of all
the images and this is known as the root team. A team is divided into
subteams by a call of the intrinsic subroutine FORM_TEAMS. Each
subteam is identified by an integer value known as its color and
information about the set of subteams is stored in a teams variable.

Execution of a CHANGE TEAM statement changes the current team to
the subteam for the executing image as determined by the specified
team variable. Execution of an END TEAM statement changes the current
team back to the previous team. CHANGE TEAM constructs may be
nested to any depth to give finer subdivisions.

5.2 CHANGE TEAM construct

The CHANGE TEAM construct changes the current team to which the
executing image belongs.

R501 change-team-construct is change-team-stmt
                                 block
                              end-team-stmt
R502 change-team-stmt      is [team-construct-name:] []
                              [] CHANGE TEAM (scalar-teams-variable)
R503 end-change-team-stmt  is END TEAM [team-construct-name]

C501 (R501) A branch within a CHANGE TEAM construct shall not have a branch
target that is outside the construct.

C502 (R501) If the change-team-stmt of a change-team-construct
specifies a team-construct-name, the corresponding end-change-team-stmt
shall specify the same team-construct-name. If the change-team-stmt of a
change-team-construct does not specify a team-construct-name, the
corresponding end-change-team-stmt shall not specify a team-construct-name.

C503 (R502) The teams-variable shall be of the type TEAMS_TYPE defined
            in the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module.

The value of the teams-variable shall have been defined by a call of
the intrinsic subroutine FORM_TEAMS executed with the same current
team as that of the change-team-stmt execution. The current team for
the statements of the change-team block is the subteam containing
the executing image that was specified by the call of FORM_TEAMS.

An allocatable coarray that was allocated when execution of a
change-team construct began shall not be deallocated during the
execution of the construct. An allocatable coarray that is allocated
when execution of a change-team construct completes is deallocated if
it was not allocated when execution of the construct began.

Both the CHANGE TEAM and END TEAM statements are image control
statements. When a CHANGE TEAM statement is executed, there is an
implicit synchronization of all images of the current team. On each
image, execution of the segment following the statement is delayed
until all the other images have executed the same statement the same
number of times. When execution of a change-team block finishes, there
is an implicit synchronization of all images of the current team. On
each image, execution of the segment following the END TEAM statement
is delayed until all the other images of the current team have
finished executing the same block the same number of times.


5.3 ROOT_TEAM

The value of the constant of derived type TEAMS_TYPE describes the
current team when execution began. It shall appear only as the TEAM
argument in a call of either of the intrinsic functions NUM_IMAGES and
THIS_IMAGE.


5.4 STAT_FAILED_IMAGE

The value of the default integer scalar constant STAT_FAILED_IMAGE is
different from the value of STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE, STAT_LOCKED,
STAT_LOCKED_OTHER_IMAGE, or STAT_UNLOCKED. Its value is assigned to
the variable specified in a STAT=specifier or STAT argument in an image
control statement if execution of the statement involves
synchronization with an image of the current team that has failed or
accessing a variable on an image of the current team that has failed.
A failed image is one for which references or definitions of data fail
when that data should be accessible, or the image fails to respond as
part of a collective activity. What constitutes a failed image is
processor dependent.

   NOTE 5.1
   A failed image is usually associated with a hardware failure
   of the processor, memory system, or interconnection network.


5.5 TEAMS_TYPE

The derived type TEAMS_TYPE is an extensible type with no type
parameters. Its components are private; no component is allocatable or
a pointer. A scalar coarray of this type describes a team that includes
the executing image.

A variable of type TEAMS_TYPE is a teams variable. A teams variable
shall be a coarray and shall not appear in a variable definition
context except as an argument to the intrinsic subroutine FORM_TEAMS
or as an <allocate-object> in an ALLOCATE statement that does not have
a SOURCE= specifier.

[15:12+] Add

7.3.6a COLOR ([TEAM])

Description. Subteam color.

Class. Transformational function.

Argument. TEAM (optional) shall be a scalar team variable. It shall
         describe an ancestor of the current team. It is an INTENT(IN)
         argument.

Result Characteristics. Default integer scalar.

Result Value. If TEAM is present, the value of the result is the value
of the argument COLOR in the call of the subroutine FORM_TEAMS that
gave TEAM its current value. If TEAM is absent and the current team is
not the root team, the value of the result is the value of the argument
COLOR in the call of the subroutine FORM_TEAMS that formed the current
team. Otherwise, the value of the result is 1.

Example. The following code illustrates the use of COLOR to control
which code is executed.

TYPE(TEAMS_TYPE) :: ODD_EVEN
    :
CALL FORM_TEAMS ( 1+MOD(ME,2), ODD_EVEN )
CHANGE TEAM (ODD_EVEN)
  SELECT CASE (COLOR())
  CASE (1)
     :  ! Code for odd images
  CASE (2)
     :  ! Code for even images
  END SELECT
END TEAM


------------------------------------
[17:44+] Add


7.3.12 FAILED_IMAGES ([KIND])

Description. Indices of failed images.

Class. Transformational function.

Argument.

KIND (optional) shall be a scalar integer constant expression.

Result Characteristics. Integer. If KIND is present, the kind type
parameter is that specified by the value of KIND; otherwise, the kind
type parameter is that of default integer type. The result is an array
of rank one whose size is equal to the number of failed images.

Result. The elements of the result are the values of the image indices
of the failed images in the current team, in numerically increasing
order.

Examples. If image 3 is the only failed image in the current team
FAILED_IMAGES() has the value [3]. If there are no failed images in
the current team FAILED_IMAGES() is a zero-sized array.


7.3.13 FORM_TEAMS (COLOR, TEAMS [,INDEX])

Description. Subdivide the current team into subteams.

Class. Collective subroutine.

Arguments.

COLOR shall be scalar and of type default integer. It is an INTENT(IN)
argument. Its value shall lie between 1 and the number of subteams and
specifies the subteam to which the executing image will belong.

TEAMS shall be a scalar team variable. It shall not describe the current
team or an ancestor of the current team. It is an INTENT(OUT) argument.
After successful execution of the subroutine, TEAMS describes the
the subteam specified by COLOR.

INDEX (optional) shall be scalar and of type integer. It is an
INTENT(IN) argument. If INDEX is present, it shall be present on all
images of the current team. Its value shall lie between 1 and the number
of images in the subteam of the executing image and specifies the image
index of the executing image in its subteam. No two images of the
subteam shall specify the same value of INDEX. If INDEX is not present,
the image indices of the images in the subteam are in the order of
their image indices in the current team.

On successful execution of FORM_TEAMS, the images of the current team
will have been grouped into subteams and the coarray TEAMS on each
image will store the details of the subteam to which that image
belongs. The new team created consists of all the images of the
current team that invoked the subroutine with the same value of COLOR.

Examples.

CALL FORM_TEAMS ( 1+MOD(ME,2), ODD_EVEN ), with ME an integer with
value IMAGE_INDEX() and ODD_EVEN of type TEAMS_TYPE, divides the
current team into two subteams according to whether the image index
is even or odd.

CALL FORM_TEAMS ( 1+MOD(ME,2), ODD_EVEN, (1+ME)/2) does this too,
ensuring that the image indices of the subteams are ordered as in
the current team.

------------------------------------
[17:44++] At the end of clause 7 add a new subclause:

7.4 Modified intrinsic procedures

7.4.1 NUM_IMAGES

The description of the intrinsic function NUM_IMAGES in ISO/IEC
1539-1:2010 is changed by adding two optional arguments TEAM and
FAILED and a modified result if either is present.

The TEAM argument shall be a scalar team variable that describes an
ancestor of the current team.  The FAILED argument shall be a scalar
LOGICAL argument. Its value determines whether the result is the
number of failed images or the number of nonfailed images.

The Result value is modified to have four cases as follows:

   Case(i) The result of NUM_IMAGES ( ) is the total number of images
           in the current team.
   Case (ii) The result of NUM_IMAGES (TEAM) is the total number of
             images in TEAM.
   Case(iii) If FAILED has the value true, the result of
           NUM_IMAGES (FAILED=FAILED) is the number of failed images
           in the current team and the result of
           NUM_IMAGES (TEAM,FAILED) is the number of failed images in
           TEAM.
   Case(iv) If FAILED has the value false, the result of
           NUM_IMAGES (FAILED=FAILED) is the number of working images
           in the current team and the result of
           NUM_IMAGES (TEAM,FAILED) is the number of working images in
           TEAM. "


7.4.2 THIS_IMAGE

The description of the intrinsic function THIS_IMAGE( ) in ISO/IEC
1539-1:2010 is changed by adding an optional argument TEAM and
a modified result if TEAM is present.

The TEAM argument shall be a scalar team variable that describes an
ancestor of the current team. If TEAM is present the result is the
value of the image index that the invoking image had when it was
executing as a member of TEAM.

------------------------------------
[19:9] Replace "Include clauses as needed" by

{In paragraph 1 of the Introduction}

After "informally known as Fortran 2008, plus the facilities defined
in ISO/IEC TS 29113:2012" add "and ISO/IEC TS 18508:2014".

{After paragraph 3 of the Introduction and after the paragraph added
by ISO/IEC TS 29113:2012, insert new paragraph}

ISO/IEC TS 18508 provides additional facilities for parallel programming:

o teams provide a capability to restrict the image set of remote memory
  references, coarray allocations, and synchronizations to a subset of
  all the images of the program;

o collective subroutines perform computations based on values on all
  the images, offering the possibility of efficient execution of
  reduction operations;

o atomic memory operations provide powerful low-level primitives for
  synchronization of activities among images;

o tagged events allow one-sided ordering of execution segments; and

o features for the support of continued execution after one or more
  images have failed.
