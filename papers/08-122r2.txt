TITLE: Size and uniqueness considerations for ID=.
KEYWORDS:
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress


QUESTION:

The ID= specifier returns an identifier (or "handle") for an async
i/o request.  Must this fit inside the smallest integer kind
supported by the processor?

Consider:
  Integer(Selected_Int_Kind(1)) x(1000)
  Character(80) :: test(1000) = (/ ... /)
  ...
  Do i=1,1000
    Write (17,'(a)',Asynchronous='Yes',Id=x(i)) test(i)
  End Do
  ...
  Do i=1,1000
    Wait (17,Id=x(i))
  End Do

X is only guaranteed to have approximately 20 values available,
and in practice will probably only have 256 such values, so
we are certainly not going to have 1000 unique handles.

Without loss of generality, suppose that one such duplicate value
is 4.  After WAIT(17,ID=4), the async i/o request with ID 4
is no longer pending.  This means that the subsequent WAIT(17,ID=4)
is not conforming to the standard since it requires that the ID=
value is one that is pending.

(1) Is the processor permitted to require a minimum size for ID=
    (e.g. such as default integer)?

Clearly 1000 values do not fit into a 256-valued object, but apart
from that,

(2) Is the processor required to produce unique ID= values for
    each multiple asynchronous i/o operation?

One might conjecture that if the processor returned ID=4 for
two or more async i/o requests on the same unit, the first WAIT
for ID=4 would wait for the first such async i/o request and the
second one would wait for the second such async i/o request.

(3) Does WAIT-ing on an ID= value wait for all async i/o operations
    that have that as the handle, or are these queued up?

Unlike other i/o-related specifiers, there does not seem to be any
constraint on the value returned for ID= (such as being non-zero
or non-negative).  In the case of the i/o being completed
synchronously, there does not appear to be any way of returning
a "non-handle" to the user program (one might have conjectured that
zero was not a handle, but this is not supported by the text of
the standard).

(4) Was there intended to be a "non-handle" return for ID=?

DISCUSSION:

It is understood that resource considerations may limit the number
of outstanding asynchronous i/o requests, but 19 (the limit implied
by the minimum-size integer that follows the model in c13) seems
awfully small; for that matter 256 seems pretty small for todays
operating systems.

ANSWER:

(1) Yes, the standard should require the ID= specifier to be default
    integer or bigger.  An edit is provided.

(2) Yes, all pending data transfer operation identifiers on a
    particular unit are required to be unique.  An edit is provided
    to clarify this.

(3) ID= values are required to be unique, so this question does not
    arise.

(4) Yes, the value zero should not be a handle but an indication the
    request was completed synchronously.  An edit is provided to add
    this.

EDITS:

In 9.5.1 Control information list,
[187:2] "ID = <scalar-int-variable>" -> "ID = <id-variable>"

[187:10+] Insert new BNF rule and constraint
  "R913a <id-variable> <<is>> <scalar-int-variable>

   C908a (R913a) <scalar-int-variable> shall be have a decimal range
         no smaller than that of default integer."
{Require default integer or larger.}

In 9.5.1.8 ID= specifier in a data transfer statement
[190:17] Change "This value" to
  "If this value is zero, the data transfer operation has been
   completed.  A nonzero value"
{Zero = "it was done synchronously already" value.}

[190:18] After "operation." insert
  "This identifier is different from the identifier of any other
   pending data transfer operation for this unit."
{Require uniqueness.}

[206:18] Before "the identifier" insert "zero or".
[206:20] After "operation" insert ", if any,".
{Make ID=zero do nothing in WAIT.}
