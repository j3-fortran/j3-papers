Subject: STAT for atomic subroutines
Date: 2014 June 24
References: N2007, N2013

Discussion:
~~~~~~~~~~~
This paper suggests adding an optional STAT argument to the atomic
subroutines to enable coping with image failure without requiring
multiple statements that involve a race condition.
Because the generic interface for many ATOMIC_<op> procedures would
become potentially ambiguous, I suggest to separate the fetch-and-op
variant from the regular op.

EDITS to N2007:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[17:9] Before "MOVE_ALLOC", add "ATOMIC_DEFINE, ATOMIC_REF, "

[17:19+] Add new paragraph
  "If the STAT argument is present in an invocation of an atomic
   subroutine and no error condition occurs, the argument is assigned
   the value zero.

   If the STAT argument is present in an invocation of an atomic
   subroutine and an error condition occurs, the ATOM argument
   becomes undefined, and the OLD argument becomes undefined if it is
   present.  Argument STAT is assigned the value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE if
   a coindexed ATOM argument is determined to be located on a failed
   image, or the value STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE in the intrinsic module
   ISO_FORTRAN_ENV if a coindexed ATOM argument is determined to be
   located on a stopped image; otherwise, the argument is assigned a
   processor-dependent positive value that is different from
   STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE and STAT_FAILED_IMAGE.

NOTE 7.1-
   If an atomic subroutine is executed for an object on a failed
   image, it is indeterminate whether the call will fail. This is
   because an image might fail, but the memory location used for the
   atomic variable on that image might remain available."

[18:12] Replace "ATOMIC_ADD (ATOM, VALUE)" by "ATOMIC_ADD (ATOM, VALUE
   [,STAT])" and delete "or ATOMIC_ADD (ATOM, VALUE, OLD)"

[18:21-22] Delete.
[18:22+] Insert
   "STAT (optional) shall be a scalar of type default integer. It is
    an INTENT(OUT) argument."

[18:23] Replace "Examples." by "Example."

[18:25-26] Delete paragraph.

[18:26+] Add new subsection

"7.4.1+ ATOMIC_FETCH_ADD (ATOM, VALUE, OLD [, STAT])
 Description. Atomic fetch and add operation.
 Class. Atomic subroutine.
 Arguments.
 ATOM shall be a scalar coarray or coindexed object and of type integer
 with kind ATOMIC_INT_KIND, where ATOMIC_INT_KIND is a named constant in
 the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV. It is an INTENT (INOUT) argument.
 ATOM becomes defined with the value of ATOM + INT(VALUE,
 ATOMIC_INT_KIND).
 VALUE shall be scalar and of type integer. It is an INTENT (IN)
 argument.
 OLD shall be a scalar and of the same type and kind as ATOM. It is an
 INTENT (OUT) argument. It is defined with the value of ATOM that was
 used for performing the add operation.
 STAT (optional) shall be a scalar of type default integer. It is
 an INTENT(OUT) argument.

 Example.
 CALL ATOMIC_FETCH_ADD(M[4], N, ORIG) causes the value of M on image 4
 to become its previous value plus the value of N on this image. ORIG is
 defined with the value 99 if the previous value of M was 99 on image
 4."

[18:27] Replace "ATOMIC_AND (ATOM, VALUE)" by "ATOMIC_AND (ATOM, VALUE
   [,STAT])" and delete "or ATOMIC_AND (ATOM, VALUE, OLD)"

[19:7-8] Delete.
[19:8+] Insert
   "STAT (optional) shall be a scalar of type default integer. It is
    an INTENT(OUT) argument."

[19:9-11] Delete ",IOLD" and "and the value of IOLD on the image
    executing the statement to be defined with the value 5".

[19:11+] Add new subsection
"7.4.2+ ATOMIC_FETCH_AND (ATOM, VALUE, OLD [, STAT])
 Description. Atomic bitwise fetch and AND operation.
 Class. Atomic subroutine.
 Arguments.
 ATOM shall be a scalar coarray or coindexed object and of type integer
 with kind ATOMIC_INT_KIND, where ATOMIC_INT_KIND is a named constant
 in the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV. It is an INTENT (INOUT)
 argument. ATOM becomes defined with the value IAND ( ATOM, INT (
 VALUE, ATOMIC_INT_KIND ) ).
 VALUE shall be scalar and of type integer. It is an INTENT(IN)
 argument.
 OLD shall be a scalar and of the same type and kind as ATOM. It is an
 INTENT (OUT) argument. It is defined with the value of ATOM that was
 used for performing the bitwise AND operation.
 STAT (optional) shall be a scalar of type default integer. It is
 an INTENT(OUT) argument.

 Example. CALL ATOMIC_FETCH_AND (I[3], 6, IOLD) causes I on image 3 to
 become defined with the value 4 and the value of IOLD on the image
 executing the statement to be defined with the value 5 if the value of
 I[3] was 5 when the bitwise fetch and AND operation executed."

[19:12] After "NEW", insert "[,STAT]"
[19:26+] Insert
"STAT (optional) shall be a scalar of type default integer. It is
 an INTENT(OUT) argument."

[19:30] Replace "ATOMIC_OR (ATOM, VALUE)" by "ATOMIC_OR (ATOM, VALUE
   [,STAT])" and delete "or ATOMIC_OR (ATOM, VALUE, OLD)"

    executing the statement to be defined with the value 2".

[19:43+] Add new subsection
"7.4.4+ ATOMIC_FETCH_OR (ATOM, VALUE, OLD [, STAT])
Description. Atomic bitwise fetch and OR operation.
Class. Atomic subroutine.
Arguments.
ATOM shall be a scalar coarray or coindexed object and of type integer
with kind ATOMIC_INT_KIND, where ATOMIC_INT_ KIND is a named constant
in the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV. It is an INTENT (INOUT)
argument. ATOM becomes defined with the value IOR ( ATOM, INT (
VALUE, ATOMIC_INT_KIND ) ).
VALUE shall be scalar and of type integer. It is an INTENT(IN) argument.
OLD shall be a scalar and of the same type and kind as ATOM. It is an
INTENT (OUT) argument. It is defined with the value of ATOM that was
used for performing the bitwise OR operation.
STAT (optional) shall be a scalar of type default integer. It is
an INTENT(OUT) argument.

Example. CALL ATOMIC_FETCH_OR (I[3], 1, IOLD) causes I on image 3 to
become defined with the value 3 and the value of IOLD on the image
executing the statement to be defined with the value 2 if the value
of I[3] was 2 when the bitwise OR operation executed."

[20:1] Replace "ATOMIC_XOR (ATOM, VALUE)" by "ATOMIC_XOR (ATOM, VALUE

 with kind ATOMIC_INT_KIND, where ATOMIC_INT_KIND is a named constant
 in the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV. It is an INTENT (INOUT)
 argument. ATOM becomes defined with the value IEOR ( ATOM, INT (
 VALUE, ATOMIC_INT_KIND ) ).
 VALUE shall be scalar and of type integer. It is an INTENT(IN) argument.
 OLD shall be a scalar and of the same type and kind as ATOM. It is an
 INTENT (OUT) argument. It is defined with the value of ATOM that was
 used for performing the bitwise exclusive OR operation.
 Example. CALL ATOMIC_FETCH_XOR (I[3], 1, IOLD) causes I on image 3 to
 become defined with the value 2 and the value of IOLD on the image
 executing the statement to be defined with the value 3 if the value of
 I[3] was 3 when the bitwise exclusive OR operation executed.

[26:20+] Add new subsection
"7.5.1- ATOMIC_DEFINE, ATOMIC_REF

The descriptions of the intrinsic functions ATOMIC_DEFINE and ATOMIC_REF
in ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010 are changed to take account of the possibility that
