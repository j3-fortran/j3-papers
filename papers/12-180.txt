In a FORTRAN program we have SEQUENCE types which are passed to a C
programm using either void pointers or an equivalent struct.

    typedef struct tagCDB_QUAD {     /* 200/00  QuadElements */
    int     m_nr;                    /*        elementnumber */
    int     m_node[4];               /*        nodenumbers */
    int     m_mat;                   /*        materialnumber */
    int     m_mrf;                   /*        material Reinf. */
    int     m_nra;                   /*        type of element */
    float   m_det[3];                /*        Jacobi Determinant */
    float   m_thick[5];              /* [1010] element thickness */
    float   m_cb;                    /*        bedding factor */
    float   m_cq;                    /*        tangential bedding factor */
    float   m_t[3][3];               /*        transformation matrix */
    } typeCDB_QUAD;

in FORTRAN we have:

      TYPE CQUAD
        SEQUENCE                   ! 200/00  QuadElements
        INTEGER   NR               !        elementnumber
        INTEGER   NODE(4)          !        nodenumbers
        INTEGER   MAT              !        materialnumber
        INTEGER   MRF              !        material Reinf.
        INTEGER   NRA              !        type of element
        REAL*4      DET(0:2)       !        Jacobi Determinant
        REAL*4      THICK(0:4)     ! [1010] element thickness
        REAL*4      CB             !        bedding factor
        REAL*4      CQ             !        tangential bedding factor
        REAL*4      T(3,3)         !        transformation matrix
      END TYPE CQUAD

But according to the standard it is not allowed (and not possible)
to extend this type:

      TYPE, EXTENDS(CQUAD) :: C_QUAD     ! EXTENDED QUAD STRUCTURE
          REAL             :: BOX(0:3)   ! SURROUNDING OCTREE BOX
          INTEGER, POINTER :: SGRP(:)    ! OPTIONAL LIST OF SECONDARY GROUPS
      END TYPE C_QUAD

Which would allow to use the CQUAD struct directly for passing these arguments
to the C function. So my suggestion would be to allow above construct, but
the sequence is only applied to the CQUAD-type of course.

Currently we solved this problem with a UNION:

      TYPE CQUAD
      UNION
      MAP                          ! 200/00  QuadElements
        INTEGER   NR               !        elementnumber
        INTEGER   NODE(4)          !        nodenumbers
        INTEGER   MAT              !        materialnumber
        INTEGER   MRF              !        material Reinf.
        INTEGER   NRA              !        type of element
        REAL*4      DET(0:2)       !        Parameter of Jacobi Determinant
        REAL*4      THICK(0:4)     ! [1010] element thickness
        REAL*4      CB             !        bedding factor
        REAL*4      CQ             !        tangential bedding factor
        REAL*4      T(3,3)         !        transformation matrix
      END MAP
      MAP ; INTEGER :: BUF(0:26); END MAP
      END UNION
      END TYPE CQUAD

which works fine, but UNION is not according to the standard either.

As the UNION is also a good replacemnt for the EQUIVALENCE I would prefer to
have the UNION (which is available in nearly all compilers) to become part
of the standard.

Yours sincerely
