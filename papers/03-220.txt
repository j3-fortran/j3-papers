                       Response to N1533 (NEW_LINE)

                          Michael Ingrassia 

Subgroup response to Dan Nagle's list of difficulties with NEW_LINE
in paper N1533.

>First, we don't acknowledge the possibility that the default character
>type may not have control characters, let alone one which may be used
>as newline,

Subgroup: There should be no requirement that the default character set has control characters.

[23:6] Delete '("newline", for example)'

       There might not be such a character.  It is not a particularly
       illuminating example.

>Second, we say where control characters are prohibited, but we don't
>say how a program may obtain one (even in a note, even though we say
>you need one to use all the features of formatted streams), and

Subgroup: Correct.  We ought not to say anything here.

>Third, in fact, we don't say anything about control characters at all
>(other than parenthetically remarking that newline is one), even how
>they might affect the collating sequence (which might change an
>existing program in an unexpected way), and

Subgroup: No edits are needed.

>Fourth, we allow processor to prohibit (some) control characters from
>appearing in formatted streams!  Evidently, we want to specifically
>allow newline, 

Subgroup: Actually, we effectively disallow newline because it causes
slash formatting action to occur instead of being written to the file
as a normal character.

>Fifth, we want to require that the C_NEW_LINE character be the same as
>the character returned by NEW_LINE for the C_CHAR character type
>(rather than noting that we anticipate a coincidence), 

Subgroup: No, we do not wish to require that.  C_NEW_LINE must return
the '\n' character for the particular companion processor.

>Sixth, we ignore the effects of newline in formatted records (whether >a character expression written to a formatted stream can be written to >a formatted record), 

Subgroup: No edit required.  It might indeed be possible for the
requirements on record files and stream files to be different.

>Seventh, while not required but since NEW_LINE is modeled after the
>inquiry intrinsics, it would be nice to allow NEW_LINE to return its
>value even when its argument is a nonpresent optional dummy argument of

[127:41+] Add to the list (and renumber the rest)

        "(4+) The inquiry function NEW_LINE,"

>Eighth, again, while not required but since NEW_LINE is modeled after
>the inquiry intrinsics, it would be nice to allow NEW_LINE in
>initialization expressions (where many programmers will want to put
>it),

Subgroup:  Agreed, but this is subsumed by the previous edit.

>Lastly, we don't say how we want NEW_LINE to work with any default,
>non-ASCII, non-ISO_10646 character types ('processor-dependent' isn't
>much of a hint).

Subgroup: Assuming newline exists for default characters, this is specified (e.g. See [235:1-7]).  It should return a blank if no newline exists (edits following).

[341:21] "," -> "and ASCII character 10 is representable in the default
character set,"

[341:15] "." -> "or a blank if no newline is available"

Subgroup: Finally, move a paragraph which is in the wrong place (this paragraph is not talking about "Other characters"). 

[24:15-20] Move to [23:20+].

[235:Note 10.17]  Subgroup finds this note potentially confusing.  Replace contents with
"Record termination by a newline character can occur only on those processors that return a nonblank result from the NEW_LINE intrinsic function."
