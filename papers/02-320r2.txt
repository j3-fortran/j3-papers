NO, we feel this is too system dependent to be standardized.  Many processors
provide for dealing with this as a command line or OPEN option.  Fortran has
resisted standardizing details of implementation at this level.

YES, we will recommend that constants be added that specify the size in bits
of the file storage unit, a numeric storage unit, and a character storage unit.

NO, it is difficult to standardize since some systems do not have a directory
concept, nor is it guaranteed that if they do, the separator will be a single
character.

NO, this isn't possible since some IO Messages are composed by the processor on
the fly, perhaps containing the format, the line in error, or the file name.
Also, user defined IO routines can return an IOMSG string of arbitrary length.

Any unit may be specified for the FLUSH statement.  The results are system
dependent, but means are provided to detect "inappropriate" but "harmless" use
of a FLUSH.

Yes, the IEEE modules provide for run-time control of rounding.  See section
14.3

This is outside the scope of the standard; but we do not believe we have done
anything that would preclude existing practice in this area.  The new C
interoperability features should remove (most of) the need for system dependent
coding.
