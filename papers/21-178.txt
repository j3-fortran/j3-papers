----------

I think I have found three glitches associated with US 15.  

Table 17.3 (p. 467) specifies IEEE_GET_FLAG and IEEE_GET_HALTING_MODE 
as simple elemental subroutines (ES). In the detailed descriptions in 
17.11, they are given as elemental subroutines despite the words 
"All the functions are simple and all the subroutines are impure 
unless otherwise stated" in the lead-in section 17.11.1 [467:4-5]. 
Edits are provided to correct this.  

18.2.3.1 [497:27-28] says "The C_F_POINTER and C_F_STRPOINTER 
subroutines are impure; all other procedures in the module are simple."
but C_F_STRPOINTER is given as a simple subroutine in its detailed
description [501:6]. An edit is provided to correct this.  


Edits to 21-007r2
-----------------

[469:20] In 17.11.5 IEEE_GET_FLAG (FLAG, FLAG_VALUE), para 2, 
change "Elemental subroutine." to "Simple elemental subroutine."

[469:31] In 17.11.6 IEEE_GET_HALTING_MODE (FLAG, HALTING), para 2, 
change "Elemental subroutine." to "Simple elemental subroutine."

[501:6] In 18.2.3.5 C_F_STRPOINTER (CSTRARRAY, FSTRPTR [, NCHARS]) 
    or ..., para 2, change "Simple subroutine." to "Subroutine."
