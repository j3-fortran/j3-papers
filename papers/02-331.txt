Subject: Optional KIND argument for IACHAR

Several intrinsic functions return integer results where the KIND of
the result cannot be inferred from the characteristics of the
arguments. For many of these intrinsics we hava added an optional KIND
argument to explicitly specify the KIND of the result.  The IACHAR
intrinsic is not included in this set, even though ICHAR is
included. On ASCII based systems ICHAR and IACHAR are equivalent,
making this asymmetry peculiar. IACHAR should have an optional KIND
argument so it has an interface like that of ICHAR.

Edits to 02-007R3:

[315:14]  (C) -> (C [,KIND])

[315:18-19] Replace with:

Arguments.

C               shall be of type default character and of length one.

KIND (optional) shall be a scalar integer initialization expression.

Result Characteristics. Integer. If KIND is present, the kind type
parameter is that supplied by the value of KIND; otherwise the kind
type parameter is that of default integer type.
