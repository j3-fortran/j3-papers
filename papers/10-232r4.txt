Subject: Interop TR: Using the CFI_desc_t type
Date: 2010 October 13
Reference: 10-165r2


The type CFI_desc_t is a partially incomplete type, and may not be used
directly as the type in a declaration .  This is no problem when
descriptors are passed to C functions, because the type passed is
actually a pointer to CFI_desc_t which is a complete type.  So the
following function declaration (as used in the TR) is fine:

    int Trivial ( CFI_desc_t * ) ;

10-165r2 needs to be corrected to state this.


Using malloc to allocate space for a descriptor of known rank is
also straightforward, and the following allocates one of rank 5:

    CFI_desc_t * desc =
        (CFI_desc_t *)malloc(sizeof(CFI_desc_t)+5*sizeof(CFI_dim_t));

While this is a bit more verbose, it is clear and that sort of thing
is very common in C.  It is trivial to hide in a function or macro.

Aside: for students of C99 arcana, the standard is ambiguous as to
whether a structure with a flexible member is a complete type or not,
but says that it has a known size in 6.7.2.1 paragraph 16, which is why
the above code is legal.

The problem arises when one wants to allocate such an object directly.
That is likely to be relatively rare, as most descriptors will be passed
as arguments.  It is also likely to be associated with the creation of
allocatable and pointer arrays, when an extra use of malloc() and free()
is not a problem.


There is actually a way to declare a descriptor of known rank statically
or on the stack with no extra mechanism, but it relies on a knowledge of
the C standard's arcane minutiae and is truly revolting anyway, so I
won't bother to describe it.  If this facility is regarded as essential,
then the TR should define an extra macro to do the job, which is the
solution adopted by several interfaces.

The macro CFI_DESC_T is trivial to implement, but obviously needs to
match the declaration of CFI_desc_t.  For example:

    typedef struct {
        void * base_addr;
        size_t elem_len;
        int version;
        CFI_rank_t rank;
        CFI_type_t type;
        CFI_attribute_t attribute;
        CFI_dim_t dim[];
    } CFI_desc_t;

    #define CFI_DESC_T(rankarg)              \
        struct {                          \
            void * base_addr;             \
            size_t elem_len;              \
            int version;                  \
            CFI_rank_t rank;              \
            CFI_type_t type;              \
            CFI_attribute_t attribute;    \
            CFI_dim_t dim[rankarg];          \
        }


Edits to 10-165r2:

[9:19] After "CFI_cdesc_t is a named struct type defined by a typedef",
insert:

    ", containing a flexible array member".

[10:1-4] The specification of the dim member should be replaced by:

    "CFI_dim_t dim[]; Each element of the array contains the lower
    bound, extent, and stride multiplier information for the
    corresponding dimension of the object.  The number of elements in
    an object of type CFI_cdesc_t shall be equal to the rank of the
    object."


[10:22] replace:

    "Each evaluates to an integer constant expression."

by:

    "Except for CFI_DESC_T, each evaluates to an integer constant
expression suitable for use in #if preprocessing directives."

{Note: This edit supersedes the edit in 10-219r1.}

[10:23+] after the definition of CFI_MAX_RANK, add:

"CFI_DESC_T is a function-like macro that takes one argument, which is
the rank of the descriptor to create, and evaluates to a type suitable
for declaring a descriptor of that rank.  A pointer to a variable
declared using CFI_DESC_T can be cast to CFI_desc_t *.

    NOTE 5.?
    The following code uses CFI_DESC_T to declare a descriptor of rank 5
    and pass it to CFI_deallocate.

    CFI_DESC_T(5) object;
    ... code to define and use descriptor ...
    CFI_deallocate((CFI_desc_t *)&object);"
