Subject: Taking note of additional processor dependencies
Date: 2022-March-26

Reference: 22-007

Annex A lists processor dependencies, but it is missing some. The
following excerpts appear to describe processor dependencies not
currently listed in Annex A. Edits are proposed to add them.

- 6.2.5 However, a processor may have a limit on the total number of 
unique statement labels in one program unit.
(This might be considered a complexity limit, see 4.2p7. There are
existing entries in Annex A that are also complexity limits.)

- 10.2.1.3 For nondefault character kinds, the blank padding character 
is processor dependent. (Also 13.7.4)

- 11.1.7.5 If a variable has REDUCE locality, on termination of the DO 
CONCURRENT construct the outside variable is updated by combining it 
with the values the construct entity had at completion of each iteration,
using the reduce-operation. The processor may combine the values in 
any order.

- 12.10.2.2  The interpretation of case is processor dependent. (INQUIRE
FILE=)

- 13.8.5 When the leading zero mode is PROCESSOR_DEFINED, the processor
has the option of producing a leading zero or not in such positions, 
subject to 13.7.2(5).

- 16.9.59  If there are no command arguments available or if the processor 
does not support command arguments, then the result has the value zero.
(Also 16.9.93)

- 16.9.83 If the processor supports command line execution, it shall 
support synchronous and may support asynchronous execution of the 
command line.

Edits
-----

Insert into Annex A (550:A.2p1, Processor Dependencies) the following
bullet items in subclause order:

- the maximum number of unique statement labels in a program unit (6.2.5)
- the blank padding character for nondefault character kinds (10.2.1.3,
(13.7.4)
- the order in which values are combined in a DO CONCURRENT reduction 
(11.1.7.5)
- the interpretation of case in the value of the FILE= specifier in 
INQUIRE (12.10.2.2)
- whether a leading zero is produced when the leading zero mode is
PROCESSOR_DEFINED (13.8.5)
- if the processor supports command arguments (16.9.59, 16.9.93)
- if the processor supports asynchronous command line execution (16.9.83)
