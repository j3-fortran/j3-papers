Subject:    Interpretation Request, commas in complex
            namelist output

The 7th paragraph in 10.9.2 for list directed output says"

"Complex constants are enclosed in parentheses with a
separator between the real and imaginary parts, each
produced as defined above for real constants. The separator
is a comma if the decimal edit mode is POINT; it is a
semicolon if the decimal edit mode is COMMA. "

There are similar words in most other places where complex
formatting is described.

The second paragraph of 10.10.1.3 Namelist group object list
items says:

"When the next effective item is of type complex, the input
form of the input value consists of a left parenthesis
followed by an ordered pair of numeric input fields
separated by a comma and followed by a right parenthesis. "

Other places correctly describe namelist complex output as
having a separator, either a comma or a semicolon, depending
on the decimal edit mode.

Should the namelist version be reworded to say "comma or
semicolon"?
