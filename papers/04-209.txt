Title: OPT=-HUGE(0)

Submitted by: J3

Status: For Consideration

References: 

Basic Functionality: Allow the programmer to indicate that no rearrangement
of expressions (or statements?) may take place. For example,
for L1(x) .or. L2(x), L1 must first be computed and,
regardless of the result L2 must be computed. In x+y+z,
x and y must be added first. In other words, the code must
be performed the same as the semantics indicate.

This might subsume the .andif. and volatile functions and
would really "mean what you code".

It is a big step which extends the idea of
"honor parentheses in expressons".

Rationale: The same as Pub-101 and Pub-102. There appears to be no
agreement on what can be done; this allows the programmer
to control things more closely.

Estimated Impact: It might make it easier to decide how to handle
the side effects issue.

There would be some small additional syntax and
its description, which might be a bit complicate,
but should be doable in one place, for the most part.

Detailed Specification: I don't have any suggestions for syntax, but perhaps
sections of code could be controlled by some syntax
that turns this on. Or it could be per procedure or
program unit.
