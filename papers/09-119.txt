The units OUTPUT_UNIT and ERROR_UNIT on every image are preconnected to
the same file, in contradiction to para. 4 of 9.5.4. I suggest an edit.

Edit to 09-007

[207:27] In 9.5.4 Connection of a file to a unit, para 4, add at the
end of the first sentence:

", except that the unit identified by the value of the named constant
OUTPUT_UNIT of the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV is preconnected to
the same file on all images and the unit identified by the value of
the named constant ERROR_UNIT of the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
is preconnected to the same file on all images".
