Introduction
============

C1128 prohibits a variable with LOCAL locality from having the
ALLOCATABLE attribute, from being finalizable, or from being a
coarray.  11.1.7.5p1 specifies that a variable with LOCAL locality is
a different entity in every iteration of a DO CONCURRENT construct,
and further specifies that a construct entity within the DO CONCURRENT
construct is ... "similar to LOCAL locality" (but not "as if LOCAL
locality").  C1128 does not prohibit a variable declared within a
BLOCK construct within a DO CONCURRENT construct from having the
ALLOCATABLE attribute, from being finalizable, or from being a
coarray.  This is an oversight. There should be additional limitations
applied to construct entities declared in a BLOCK construct that
executes during an iteration of a DO CONCURRENT construct. We agree
that ALLOCATABLE should be allowed in both cases. The final
subroutines for finalizable variables should be required to be pure.

Edits
=====

[181:22 C1128 (eighth constraint after syntax rules in 11.1.7.2 Form
of the DO construct] remove the restriction on ALLOCATABLE variables
and permit finalizable variables as long as the final subroutine is
pure.  Making the whole constraint read:


C1128 A <variable-name> that appears in a LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT
      <locality-spec> shall not have the INTENT (IN) or OPTIONAL
      attribute, shall not be of a finalizable type that has an impure
      final procedure, shall not be a nonpointer polymorphic dummy
      argument, and shall not be a coarray or an assumed-size array. A
      <variable-name> that is not permitted to appear in a variable
      definition context shall not appear in a LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT
      <locality-spec>.

[182:1+] At the end of 11.1.7.2 Form of the DO construct add a new
paragraph:

"A variable that is declared in a BLOCK construct that executes as
 part of an iteration of a DO CONCURRENT construct shall not be of a
 finalizable type that has an impure final procedure and shall not be
 a coarray."
