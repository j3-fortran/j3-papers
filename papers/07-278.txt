1. Monday, August 6, 2007  9:00 am
----------------------------------

    Monday was spent entirely doing WG5 business.  In some cases, people gave
    J3 reports on Monday as part of the WG5 opening business.  Those reports
    were copied into the J3 Tuesday agenda section with a note.

2. Tuesday, August 7, 2007  9:00 am
-----------------------------------

    J3 meeting #181 was called to order at 0900AM by the Chair, Dan Nagle, at
    the British Computer Society office in London, England.

    J3 began by processing the items normally covered in Monday's opening
    business.

1.1 Opening business                              D. Nagle

    The Chairman welcomed everyone.

1.1.1 Remarks from the chair                      D. Nagle

    Dan Nagle welcomed Shivarama Rao, the new representative from Hewlett
    Packard, who replaces Rich Bleikamp.

    We expect to work in subgroups this afternoon.  Interpretations and
    Unresolved Technical Issues (UTIs) will be the major J3 efforts.

1.1.2 Adoption of agenda                          D. Nagle

**  motion: Adopt the agenda, noting that in a joint meeting, we will split
            time between working as J3 and working as WG5.  (Moved by Van
            Snyder/Seconded by Bill Long): passed by unanimous
            consent  (uc)

1.1.3 Approval of Meeting 180 minutes             D. Nagle

**  motion: Approve paper 07-235r1, the minutes of J3 meeting #180
            (Snyder/Long):  uc

1.1.4 NCITS/OMC report (if any)                   D. Nagle

    CT22 will meet August 20.  

    Other technical committees are also complaining about the rise in INCITS
    membership fees to $1200.  Nagle will see if there are any steps that would
    allow lower fees.

1.1.5 OWG-V report (if any)                       D. Nagle

[Presented Monday during WG5 opening business]

    NAGLE: vulnerabilities (OWG-V) Lot of impetus from Dept of Homeland
    Security because of cyber-terrorism threats.  The OWG-V aim is to
    produce coding standards to avoid bad software.  Trying to do more
    than a motherhood document.  Looking at frequency of actual bugs and
    trying to develop ways to avoid them.  Dan suspects Homeland Security
    will eventually pressure other government departments to adhere to
    guidelines.  They may also pressure insurance companies to NOT issue
    policies covering software that doesn't meet guidelines. 

    There will be a language independent section on security and then a
    series of language dependent sections with specific suggestions, eg,
    "use Fortran whole arrays to avoid index out of bounds errors".

    OWG-V really liked our annex with processor dependencies.

1.1.6 ISO/WG5 report                               Van Snyder, IR

    No specific report.  The US national activity report N1684 covers
    the current status.

1.1.7 J11 Liaison report (if any)                  C. Rasmussen

    Craig Rasmussen was absent.

    Nagle:  C and C++ have been asked by a group of Argonne scientists to
    add a series of special functions to their libraries.  They are
    working on an optional binding to them.  See Donev's paper N1688 for
    a Fortran solution.  He has omitted the accuracy requirements.  C and
    C++ are apparently doing something like a type 2 optional annex.
    Perhaps it will become a separate stand-alone standard.  John Reid
    will try to talk to C and C++ people to see if we can come up with a
    compatible way of proceeding.  We could put them in clause 13 or into
    an optional "part 4" of the standard.  If we do the latter, we might
    want to add some of the new functions, loggamma, etc., to this optional
    part.  

    Bill Long:  If this is a library of C functions written in C, why don't
    we just write a module that interfaces to them?  We would need to deal
    with elemental and generic aspects.

    Further information was presented during the WG5 sessions.

1.1.8 H2 Liaison report (if any)                   D. Nagle

    Nothing to report

1.1.9 IEEE 754 report (if any)                     M. Ingrassia

[Presented Monday during WG5 opening business]

    The IEEE 754 draft is being revised, trying to reach "maximum
    consensus".  If consensus isn't reached, there will be another
    round of revisions and ballots.  There are still two formats for
    decimal arithmetic.

1.1.10 Treasurer's report                          V. Snyder

    We now have a checking account in the correct name.  No expenses
    since last meeting.

    There is no meeting fee for this meeting.

1.1.11 Beginning membership report (from e-mail)   S. Whitlock

    J3 alternates present but not voting

      M. Cohen (alternate for J. Martin - in attendance)
      A. Donev (alternate for D. Nagle - in attendance)

    Visitors:  WG5 members

      Ian Chivers          UK
      Steve Morgan         UK
      David Muxworthy      UK
      John Reid            UK
      Lawrie Schonfelder   UK
      Jane Sleightholme    UK
      Maki Takata          Japan

    Shivarama Rao is the new HP rep.  HP is in jeopardy of losing
    membership because of missing 2 of the last 3 meetings.  HP will have
    to attend J3 meeting #181 in order to not lose membership.
 
    IBM is in jeopardy of losing membership because of missing 2 of the last
    3 meetings;  IBM will have to attend J3 meeting #181 in order to not lose
    membership.
 
    No one is in jeopardy of losing membership because of missing 2 of
    the last 3 letter ballots.

1.1.12 Local arrangements                        D. Nagle

    Described, but not noted.

1.1.13 Comments from members

    From Stan Whitlock (by e-mail): Dan Nagle/Van Snyder need to produce a
    new "appendix C" for the minutes.  Stan Whitlock will be local host for
    November meeting.  We need to decide on a host for the next meetings.

    Van Snyder:  INCITS has an emeritus category.  Perhaps we should nominate
    Jerry Wagener, Mallory North, Richard Maine, and Loren Meissner.  That
    will allow them to come to the meetings and participate, but not vote,
    without paying the INCITS meeting fee.

    Perhaps we should nominate everyone who meets the 10 year rule.  

1.2 Subgroup organization                         D. Nagle

    We will have the normal 3 working subgroups, plus /INTERP and /EDIT

    During the WG5 meeting, it was decided to delete the macro feature
    and scale back the BIT feature.  See N1690 resolution L5 and N1695
    for the BITS changes.  The following two motions allow the editor
    to begin the editorial work.

** motion: Delete macros but not block (Cohen/Snyder):  UC

** motion: Delete bits except for the bit manipulation functions that
           apply to integers (Cohen/Hendrickson):  UC

    The editor will create a standing document that has pages changed as
    a result of interpretations for F2003: 017 will be the new document.

5.1 Closing business

5.2 Review of action items (if any) - none

5.3 Future meetings                               V. Snyder

      Whitlock          will act as host for 182
      Xia/Nagle/Snyder  will act as host for 183
      Hendrickson       will act as host for 184

      Snyder will look into hosting meeting 185 in Pasadena

    meeting 187 February 9 – 13, 2009  pre-meeting deadline,
    January 26th, 2009

    See Appendix C for details of future meetings.

5.4 Treasurer's report                            V. Snyder

    No expenses or income at this meeting.  See 07-277 for the

** motion: Restore the meeting fee to $50.00 (Long/Cohen):  UC

5.5 Closing membership report                     S. Whitlock

    None given.  Added by S Whitlock after the meeting:

      Shivarama Roa is the new HP representative, replacing Rich Bleikamp.

      HP {S Rao} is in jeopardy of losing membership because of missing 2 of
      the last 3 meetings.  S Whitlock will send Shivarama a reminder that he
      must attend meeting #182 or HP will lose J3 membership.

      IBM {Jim Xia} is no longer in jeopardy of losing membership because he
      has attended 2 of the last 3 meetings.

      No one is in jeopardy of losing membership because of missing
      2 of the last 3 letter ballots.

      See Appendix E for Membership details.

5.6 Comments from members

    The chair noted that WG5/N1690 resolution L5 directs J3 to remove the
    Intelligent Macro feature and to significantly scale back the BIT feature.
    It was also discovered that the work to make the ENTRY statement
    obsolescent was inadvertently left out of the current draft.  Papers will
    be needed at the next meeting.

    There was a warm round of thanks to the local hosts and to all who made the
    meeting such a success.  

** motion: Adjourn (Long/Snyder):  UC
