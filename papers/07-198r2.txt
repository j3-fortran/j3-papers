2 Questions without edits, Straw votes needed

[188:19-22] --------------------------------------------------------------
Was there a conscious decision taken that variables defined in more than
one iteration are undefined after the construct terminates, while pointers
whose pointer association status is changed in more than one iteration
have a processor-dependent association status? Could we make them both
either undefined or processor-dependent? If we make the pointers
undefined, we should say so in 16.5.2.2.3, not here.

Straw vote:  What should the pointer association status be
07       change it to undefined
 0       leave as processor dependent
05       undecided

Subgroup will change it to "undefined", see edit to 188:19

[179:5] ------------------------------------------------------------------
[Editor: Insert "if that dimension of the <selector> has an extent;
otherwise that dimension has no upper bound" to take care of the
possibility the <selector> is a whole assumed-size dummy argument.]

[123:8+]------------------------------------------------------------------
[Editor: Insert a new paragraph:]
An <associate-name> that is construct associated in an ASSOCIATE or SELECT
TYPE construct with a <selector> that is a whole assumed-size array is a
whole assumed-size array.

Straw vote:  Should we allow assumed size arrays as a <selector>?
 0     Yes, add words as above
09     No,
03     Undecided

subgroup will take no more action on this
Use of an assumed size array already disallowed by text on 123:9-11.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

No further action:


[180:34] -----------------------------------------------------------------
[Editor: Replace "of the . . . statements" by "selector of a CASE
statement in a CASE construct".]

[183:13] -----------------------------------------------------------------
[Editor: Replace "this" by "that".]

[183: Note 8.9] ----------------------------------------------------------

precede' by "always precedes".]

[186:23] -----------------------------------------------------------------
An <index-name> in a DO CONCURRENT construct has a scope of the
construct (16.4). The type and kind of the index variables and their
values for the iterations of the construct"

[186:25-27] --------------------------------------------------------------
[Editor: Delete.]

[187:9] ------------------------------------------------------------------
[Editor: Insert "simultaneously or" after "occur".]

HPC subgroup will look at changing the example.

Use syntax instead of constraint

R214 action-stmt                     is <if-consequent-action-stmt>
                                     or <end-function-stmt>
