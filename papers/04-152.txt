Subject:   Adding MOLD to ALLOCATE


Title: 

Submitted by: J3

Status: For Consideration

References: J3/02-274, J3/03-254, J3/03-007r2

Basic Functionality: 

A MOLD argument should be added to ALLOCATE similar to the SOURCE
argument, which would only give the type of the allocated data, but not
the contents. This would allow one to allocate an array of a given type
given only a scalar of that type, which is needed to design custom
allocators for various dynamic data structures.

Rationale: 

Certain dynamic data-structures strain the memory allocator to a
maximum, requesting allocation and deallocation of lots of nodes (i.e.,
small allocations), while in actuality not really changing the total
allocated memory much. To deal with such situations efficiently across
a variety of compilers and usage patterns, it is best to include as
part of the dynamic data structure a memory "allocator". Such an
allocator can be made type-independent by using a scalar mold to give
the type of the allocation only, but not the contents.

There are other similar situations where it is desired to allocate a
new object of unknown dynamic type, and rather then clone the contents
of another object, perform default initialization on the newly
allocated object. This is very similar to the "new" operator in C++. 

The current SOURCE in ALLOCATE is not appropriate because it does a
clone operation:

1. "source-variable is then assigned to allocate-object by intrinsic
assignment for objects whose declared type is the dynamic type of
source-variable"

and there is also the restriction:

2. "The source-variable shall be a scalar or have the same rank as
allocate-object"

which means that one cannot allocate a whole array given just a scalar
as a type template (mold).

Estimated Impact:

I believe this feature has a modest impact on both the standard and
compilers.

This is very simple to incorporate into the standard (I proposed
detailed edits earlier).

Implementation wise, the only difference with SOURCE is that default
initialization needs to be performed on a polymorphic variable, i.e.,
without knowing the type at compile-time. That is, one must have the run
time support to default-initialize a variable given its type descriptor
and address. This already needs to be done for
polymorphic INTENT(OUT) (see 270:38-41 in draft 03-007r2) variables, so
the run-time support neccessary for it needs to be in compilers already.

Detailed Specification:

Add a MOLD keyword to the ALLOCATE statement, to determine the type of
the allocated object, just like SOURCE, but using default initialization
for the value of the allocated object. Also allow the mold to be a
scalar even if the allocation is for a higher-rank array.

Therefore:

CLASS(base_type), POINTER :: variable, expression
ALLOCATE(variable, MOLD=expression)

should be equivalent to:

ALLOCATE(dynamic_type_of_expression::variable)

when the type of the mold is accessible.

These are edits I have prepared earlier in reference to J3-007R3. They
illustrate the basic ideas:

108: Replace <mold-variable> with <mold-expression>
everywhere in the document and in the edits below.

108: 15+ Add:
or MOLD = <mold-variable>

109: 4+ Add:
<mold-variable> is <expr>

109: 6 Replace:
", either <type-spec>, MOLD=, or SOURCE= shall appear"

109: 10 do the same as for 109:6

109: 19+ Add constraint:
(Cxxx) Both SOURCE= and MOLD= shall not appear.

109: 20 Add:
"IF SOURCE= or MOLD= appears," and
"with <source-variable> or <mold-variable>"

109: 23 Add:
"and <source-variable> or <mold-variable>"

109: 28
Delete ",source variable" if we make the source an expression.
[it is an expression and cannot be deallocated.]

109: 33 Add:
"if a <source-variable> or <mold-variable>"
109: 34 Add:
"the <source-variable> or <mold-variable>"

110:10+ Add:
"If MOLD= appears, default initialization is performed for
<allocate-object> for the dynamic type of <mold-variable>. If the value
of a nondeferred nonkind type parameter of <allocate-object> is
different from the value of the corresponding type parameter of
<mold-variable>, an error condition occurs."
