Subject: Issue 90

Fix procedure arguments re asynchronous, volatile & value (Issue 90).
ASYNCHRONOUS and VOLATILE attributes are both allowed for a variable
(no change in current behavior).
ASYNCHRONOUS is allowed with INTENT(IN) and VALUE.
The change is to specify that variables in asynchronous can't be changed
during pending I/O operations.
