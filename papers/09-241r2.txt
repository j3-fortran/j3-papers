Discussion

It has always been the intention that the only way that a program is
allowed to alter a lock variable is via the lock and unlock statements.
This is expressed by C1303 and C1304:

"C1303 A lock variable shall not appear in a variable definition context
except as the lock-variable in a LOCK or UNLOCK statement, or as an
actual argument in a reference to a procedure with an explicit
interface where the corresponding dummy argument has INTENT(INOUT).

C1304 A variable with a subobject of type LOCK TYPE shall not appear in
a variable definition context except as an actual argument in a
reference to a procedure with an explicit interface where the
corresponding dummy argument has INTENT (INOUT)."

A variable definition context (16.6.7) includes

"(11) ... , <allocate-object>, ...

"(12) an actual argument in a reference to a procedure with an explicit
interface if the associated dummy argument has the INTENT (OUT) or
INTENT (INOUT) attribute;"

We certainly want to allow allocatable coarrays of locks since they may
be needed to provide separate locks for data that are dynamically
partitioned. We therefore need to alter these constraints.  The
deallocation of a coarray of locks some of which are locked does not
present a problem since this implies the synchronization of all images.
However, SOURCE= in an ALLOCATE statement might suddenly created some
new locked variables. Let's disallow this.

The constraints cover many cases where a lock variable has
intent(out), but not all (the interface need not be explicit if the
procedure has a dummy argument that is not a coarray but has a coarray
component of type LOCK TYPE). Furthermore, they allow the programmer to
write a procedure with a dummy lock variable of intent(out), but
disallow any invocation of it. An edit is provided to correct this.

[97:14+] In 5.3.10 INTENT attribute after C541 add

"C541a An entity with the INTENT(OUT) attribute shall not be of type
LOCK_TYPE (13.8.2.16) of the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV or have a
subcomponent of this type."

[127:9]. In 6.7.1 ALLOCATE statement, 6.7.1.1 Syntax, C642, change "or
C_FUNPTR" to ", C_FUNPTR, LOCK_TYPE (13.8.2.6), or have a
subcomponent of declared type LOCK_TYPE".

[127:18+] in 6.7.1.1. Syntax, after para 3, insert a new para
"If <allocate-object> is a coarray, <source-expr> shall not have a
 dynamic type of C_PTR, C_FUNPTR, or LOCK_TYPE, or have an
 ultimate component whose dynamic type is LOCK_TYPE."

[400:30] In 13.8.2.16, LOCK_TYPE, constraint C1303, add
"as an <allocate-object>," after "statement,".

[400:33] In 13.8.2.16, LOCK_TYPE, constraint C1304, add
"<allocate-object> or as" after "except as an".
