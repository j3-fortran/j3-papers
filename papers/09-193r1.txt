Subject: LOCKs and segment ordering
Date: 2009 May 5th

Discussion:

All of the synchronization primitives, including CRITICAL (see
[174:23-24]), include a description of how they affect segment
ordering. This seems to be missing for the LOCK and UNLOCK
statement. This omission has led some external readers
of our draft to believe that the
segment ordering semantics of locks is contained in the implicit
SYNC MEMORY statement ([193:17]). I propose to add appropriate
words concerning segment ordering to the LOCK/UNLOCK clause, and
eliminate the implied SYNC MEMORY statement.

The semantics of CRITICAL blocks should conform to the common
model that there is a global shadow lock variable associated with the
construct that was LOCKED on entry and UNLOCKED on exit. I believe
the words already there for CRITICAL are appropriate, and all that
is needed is to remove the implied SYNC MEMORY.

Justification:

The implicit SYNC MEMORY in LOCK/UNLOCK will have efficiency
penalties and has the wrong semantics of a two-way code motion
barrier (see Note 8.38). Some readers and implementors may assume
that every LOCK/UNLOCK statement must include a full memory fence,
which may increase implementation cost on some architectures. This is
particularly true for unsuccessful LOCK statements, but it is also
true for successful ones. Namely, locks only cause one-way segment
ordering. The segment before an UNLOCK statement precedes the segment
that follows the next successful LOCK statement. This one-way ordering
allows for code motion in one direction. The implicit SYNC MEMORY,
on the other hand, would block code motion in both directions. If we
give a guarantee of an implied SYNC MEMORY now, we cannot go back in
a future revision because some users may start relying on it (for
example, in conjuction with atomic intrinsics). We therefore ought
to remove the implicit SYNC MEMORY now.

Edits:
=====================

-------------------------------------------------------
[193:17-19] In 8.5.5, SYNC MEMORY statement, replace para 5 by
"All the other image control statements 
except CRITICAL, END CRITICAL, LOCK, and UNLOCK
include the effect of executing a SYNC MEMORY statement."

-------------------------------------------------------
[195:4+] Add a new paragraph p4+:
"During the execution of the program, the value of a lock variable
changes through a sequence of locked and unlocked states due to the
execution of LOCK and UNLOCK statements.
If image M executes an UNLOCK statement that causes a lock variable to
become unlocked, and image T is the next to execute a LOCK statement
that causes that variable to become locked, then the segments that
execute on image M before the UNLOCK statement precede the segments
that execute on image T after the LOCK statement. Execution of a
LOCK statement with an ACQUIRED_LOCK= specifier that does not cause
the lock variable to become locked does not affect segment ordering."
