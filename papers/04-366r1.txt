Subject: TARGET attribute for associate names

NUMBER:
TITLE: TARGET attribute for associate names
KEYWORDS: TARGET, POINTER, ASSOCIATE
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:
Consider the following code:

      program assocTarget
        integer, pointer :: first_ptr
        integer, pointer :: second_ptr
        integer, target  :: tgt

        tgt       =  20
        first_ptr => tgt

        associate(aname => first_ptr)
          second_ptr => aname
        end associate
      end

Section 16.4.1.5 (Construct association) indicates that the
associating entity aname is associated with the target of first_ptr.
However, section 8.1.4.3 (Attributes of associate names) indicates
that aname does not have the TARGET attribute, since this would only
be true if the selector had the TARGET attribute.

Was this example intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:
Yes, this example was intended to be standard-conforming.  Edits are
supplied to correct this oversight.

EDITS:
All edits refer to 04-007.
[161:18-19] Remove ", TARGET,".
[161:19]    After "attribute.", insert the following sentence:
             The associating entity has the TARGET attribute if and only
             if the selector is a variable and has either the TARGET or
             POINTER attribute.
