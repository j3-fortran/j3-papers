At Delft (N1637), it was decided to add a storage_size()
intrinsic to f08.  This paper attempts to provide edits.

This paper places storage_size alphabetically within section 13.

The original paper is 04-342r1.

Edits:

[125:41+] Add list item

"(4+) the intrinsic module function STORAGE_SIZE,"

"storage_size()   storage size in bits"

[354:9+] Add section

"13.7.115+ STORAGE_SIZE (X [, KIND])

*Description.*  Returns the storage size in bits for a
                nonpointer nonallocatable scalar
                of the declared type of X.

*Class.*  Inquiry function.

*Arguments.*

X               may be of intrinsic or derived type.  It
                shall not be polymorphic.  If it is
                of derived type, that type
                shall have no allocatable ultimate
                components.  If its type has
                any deferred type parameters, it shall
                be a pointer that is associated or
                an allocatable object that is
                allocated. It may be a scalar.

KIND (optional) shall be a scalar integer initialization
                expression.

*Result Characteristics.*  Integer scalar.
                           If KIND is present, the kind
                           type parameter is that
                           specified by the value
                           of KIND; otherwise, the kind
                           type parameter is that
                           of default integer type.

*Result Value.*  The result value is the size in bits
                 of the storage unit (16.4.3.1)
                 in a storage association context
                 for a nonpointer nonallocatable scalar
                 with the declared type and
                 type parameters of X.

*Example.*  STORAGE_SIZE(1.0) returns the number of bits
            required to store an entity of type default
            real.
