The UK Fortran panel meet on 16 January on Teams. Almost all the
discussion was on the list of potential new features in WG5-N2234.
J3 has given these indicative levels for the amount of committee work
needed for incorporation in the Standard and vendor work needed for
eventual implementation (see J3/24-167). We were particularly concerned
about the lack of progress on these features:
     US04 (level 7). Add asynchronous tasks.
and
     US10 (level 6). Add a Fortran-friendly preprocessor.

We think that work these will need to start as a matter of urgency if
they are to be completed within the development schedule of the next
Standard.
