Subject:   Dereferencing C Pointers


Title: Dereferencing C Pointers

Submitted by: J3

Status: For Consideration

References: J3/03-255, J3/03-277

Basic Functionality:

No mechanism is currently provided to directly de-reference a C
pointer. Rather, argument association is used throughout, which does
not work when the pointer is part of a derived type (structure). One
can also use C_F_POINTER to create a Fortran pointer to the data and
then de-reference it. This is very cumbersome and likely to be very
inefficient. A direct mechanism should be provided to dereference a
TYPE(C_PTR) pointer, both in left and right hand contexts, at least for
intrinsic types. Additionally, since C pointers are used as arrays in
C, one should be able to specify an offset to use in the dereferencing.

Because of the syntax that was chosen in Fortran 2003, I see no other
way but to use intrinsics for this. In particular, I do not see how to
allow direct assignment (write) to a memory location pointed by a C
pointer, other then through an intrinsic subroutine. This is
unfortunate, but the decision to make C pointers nonpointer in Fortran
has already been made...

Rationale:

C pointers are used as arrays inside C structures, and thus the need to
dereference C pointers in an array-like manner appears very frequently
in practice. We need a better mechanism for this than the one currently
provided. Additionally, J3/03-255 explains the need for a C-like
pointer in Fortran, and the proposed functionality essentially uses C
pointers to provide such a functionality (again a workaround...), even
though in a cumbersome-to-use manner.

Estimated Impact: 

Requires introduction of at least two new intrinsics. Very easy to
implement.

Detailed Specification: 

Introduce the following new intrinsic function:

C_VALUE(CPTR, MOLD [, INDEX])

CPTR is a C pointer
MOLD is like the usual mold arguments and specifies the type of the
return value. We may require it to be of interoperable type.
INDEX is an integer giving the offset (when the C pointer points to a
contiguous array), defaulting to 0 (it is C-style, i.e., starts at 0)
The result is a scalar of type MOLD

Introduce an intrinsic subroutine:

C_STORE(CPTR, VALUE [, INDEX])
CPTR is INTENT(IN) and is a C pointer
VALUE is INTENT(IN) and is of any (interoperable?) type.
INDEX is an INTENT(IN) integer offset
This routine will store the value of VALUE into the location pointed by
CPTR.

Example:

struct array // C "array descriptor"
{
   int n_elements;
   float *values;
}

TYPE, BIND(C) :: Array
   INTEGER(C_INT) :: n_elements
   TYPE(C_PTR) :: values
END TYPE   

TYPE(Array) :: array
INTEGER(C_INT) :: i

! Write to the array
DO i=1,array%n_elements
   CALL C_STORE(CPTR=array%values, VALUE=2.0*i, INDEX=i)
END DO

! Read from the array
DO i=1,array%n_elements
   WRITE(*,*) "array(", i, ")=", C_VALUE(CPTR=array%values, MOLD=1.0_c_float, INDEX=i)
END DO
