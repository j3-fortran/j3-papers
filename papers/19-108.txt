Introduction
============

Fortran has fine-grain parallelism in the form of array operations,
medium-grain parallelism in the form of DO CONCURRENT constructs, and
coarse-grain parallelism in the form of coarrays.

This paper proposes additional medium-grain parallelism structures,
addressing the same use cases described in 18-237.

18-243 was rejected by /JOR without plenary discussion.  Meeting minutes
remark "not on work plan."

Asynchronous subroutine execution was discussed at meeting 216.  The
vote was (Y:8, N:0, U:5).  This suggests there is sentiment for support
for medium-grain parallelism.  The asynchronous subroutine proposition
was rejected at meeting 217 because it does not provide anything not
already available using "existing parallel tools, posix, or OpenMP."
This proposal addresses the desire for more support for medium-grain
parallelism in different ways.

Proposals
=========

1. Fork-Join construct
----------------------

A Fork-Join construct is a construct with blocks that can be executed in
any order, or in parallel (e.g., in separate threads).  It has been
pointed out that one can "fake" this by using a SELECT CASE construct
within a DO CONCURRENT construct.  A Fork-Join construct would be
syntactic sugar for this idiom.  Therefore, much of the processor
infrastructure and editorial work needed to describe it are already in
place.  A possible syntax might be

  PARALLEL
  FORK [ ( <logical-expr> ) ]
    <block-specification-part> ! Same as LOCAL locality, right?
    <block>
  FORK [ ( <logical-expr> ) ]
    <block-specification-part> ! Same as LOCAL locality, right?
    <block>
  ...
  END PARALLEL or JOIN

The rules for interaction between blocks are the same as the rules for
interaction between iterations of a DO CONCURRENT construct.

The purpose of [ ( <logical-expr> ) ] is to avoid starting a thread for
a block for which the first action is to terminate execution of the
block.  This isn't possible with a SELECT CASE construct within a DO
CONCURRENT construct.

Alternative syntax: "FORK [ IF ( <logical-expr> ) ]" (yeah, I know it
smells like perl, but "[ IF ( <logical-expr> ) ] FORK" is weirder).

2. Asynchronous blocks
----------------------

An asynchronously-executed block is the same as an inlined
asynchronously-executed procedure.  When the sequence of execution
reaches an asynchronous block, the processor can ignore the
"asynchronous" advice, or it can create an independent sequence of
execution (e.g., a thread) that executes the block asynchronously, and
then proceed immediately to the first executable construct after the
block.  To determine when execution of the block is complete, the block
shall specify an event variable, for which any sequence of execution can
wait.  A possible extension of the syntax of the BLOCK construct might
be

  [ ASYNCHRONOUS ( <event-variable> ) ] BLOCK
    <block-specification-part>
    <block>
  END BLOCK

Syntactic sugar for

  ASYNCHRONOUS ( <event-variable> ) BLOCK
    ASSOCIATE ( ... )
      <block>
    END ASSOCIATE
  END BLOCK

might be

  [ ASYNCHRONOUS ( <event-variable> ) ] ASSOCIATE ( ... )
    <block>
  END ASSOCIATE

Syntactic sugar for

  ASYNCHRONOUS ( <event-variable> ) BLOCK
    <block-specification-part>
    ASSOCIATE ( ... )
      <block>
    END ASSOCIATE
  END BLOCK

might be

  [ ASYNCHRONOUS ( <event-variable> ) ] ASSOCIATE ( ... )
    <block-specification-part>
    <block>
  END ASSOCIATE

The rules for interaction with asynchronous blocks for which one has not
waited for the block's event are the same as the rules for interaction
between iterations of a DO CONCURRENT construct.

If a subprogram or block contains an asynchronous block, when it
executes a RETURN, END, or END BLOCK statement, it is necessary to wait
for all asynchronous blocks to complete execution, before the procedure
(or construct) completes execution.  This imposes the same sort of
book-keeping requirement as is needed to deallocate local allocatable
variables.

Asynchronous blocks were proposed in section 18 of 97-114r2.

To avoid the appearance of a syntax conflict with the ASYNCHRONOUS
statement that declares the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute for a variable, the
constructs might instead be introduced by

  BLOCK [, ASYNCHRONOUS ( <event-variable> ) ]

and

  ASSOCIATE ( ... ) [, ASYNCHRONOUS ( <event-variable> ) ]

Caveats from Ada committee
==========================

Ada has a long history of parallel processing.  It was a requirement in
the first "Strawman" requirements document in 1976.  The 1983 standard
provided tasks.  Newer standards have provided other mechanisms, as
described by Burns and Wellings in "Concurrent and Real Time Programming
in Ada."

The project editor for the Ada standard, and lead developer for Verdix
Ada, Randy Brukardt, informed me that the Ada committee believes
asynchronous subroutines and asynchronous blocks are bad ideas because
they make it too easy to introduce race conditions that are very
difficult to find.
