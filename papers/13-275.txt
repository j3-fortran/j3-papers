Discussion
----------

It was intended that SYNC TEAM be restricted in its effects to images 
of the current team, but this is not clearly stated. 

Edits to N1967:
---------------

[10:26-27] Change "team specified by the <team-variable>" to 
"subteam of the current team that includes the executing image 
and is specified by the value of <team-variable>.  The value of
<team-variable> shall have been established by an execution of 
FORM SUBTEAM by the current team".
