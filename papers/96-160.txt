Subject:  Replies to N1192 ballot comments

Thanks to all that sent comments along with their vote on N1192.
Below is a copy of the note from Miles (with the comments on N1192)
with replies from the Project Editor on lines that follow
##P.E.Reply>

Those that see a "No comment" reply will need to let me know if
you were expecting a reply from the Project Editor.

Note that replies to private email from Henry Zongaro and John Reid
are in other papers.  Please also note that a some responses ask for
guidance from X3J3, SC22WG5 and the CoCo email development body.

One final note of thanks; to Malcolm for suggesting CCR402 in place
of R402 as the below responses could lead to some confusion.  I am
using the N1192 rules below, but have changed the rules in N1192r1 to
the suggested CCRsnn which will simplify future communication.  As
well, the sections are numbered CCs.

Accompanying a YES vote:
========================

However, the document should be formatted before submission to SC22.

##P.E.Reply> ISO formatting in progress.

The following editorial error should be corrected:
   In R301, "coco-char-literal-constant" is missing.

##P.E.Reply>
## No.
## This is not an editorial error.  The coco-char-literal-constant is
## only allowed in the ??ERROR directive (R701, R702) and is not
## allowed in a coco expression (R502).

Accompanying a NO vote:

1.  Technical comments:

Reid
----

The document is quite obviously not ready. It is not properly
formatted, it contains draft text of the form:

[A name is specified in part 1, section x.y of this standard.]

and its contains invalid Fortran such as

         PURE FUNCTION GET_RABBIT_WEIGHT(A_RABBIT)
RESULT(WEIGHT)

##P.E.Reply>
## Yes.
## ISO formatting in progress.
## Other comments have been fixed.
## For replies to private email from John Reid, please see
## paper X3J3/96-xyz.  Quite ironic that I don't have a paper
## number for it yet :)

Whereas I concur with the general direction of the draft, I believe that
it has had insufficient time for refinement in its current form.

Until the Dresden meeting, it was not yet even decided which of the
major alternatives ("fortran-like" vs "cpp-like") was preferred.
Also, the "fortran-like" alternative selected recently underwent major
prunning.  Again, whereas I agreed with that pruning (and even had a
part in suggesting it), it was a major change adopted relatively late
in the process.

It is typical of human nature (well, mine anyway) that when several
proposals are on the table, they do not get as careful a review as
when the one selected proposal is being refined.  We have just now
passed the stage of selecting among the proposals.  Whereas there
has of course, been substantial refinement of the proposals during
this process, it is now time to do the final refinement.

There is always a desire and need to progress the work as rapidly
as feasable, but I see no unusual urgency that justifies skipping
the final refinement steps for CoCo.

The above comments are more procedural than about specific technical
points.  I have not spent sufficient time reviewing the technical
content of the document in its current form, and I doubt that I
am alone in that.

##P.E.Reply>
## No comment.

Meissner
--------

The general direction of the project is satisfactory. However, additional
exposure to the Fortran
user community, for technical review as well as further editorial refinement,
is needed.

##P.E.Reply>
## No comment.

Hendrickson
-----------

The document needs further technical review.  I have no concerns with
the direction and do not know of any serious problems.  It just hasn't
had enough review in its final form.

##P.E.Reply>
## No comment.

Whitlock
--------

I believe that the document needs further technical review.  I agree with the
chosen direction but it just hasn't had enough review in this form to be final.

##P.E.Reply>

General:
WG5 decided only at its last meeting that the CoCo approach was
preferable to the fpp approach and N1192 was seen in its present form
only at that meeting.  History indicates that a thorough review by WG5
is likely to reveal the need for corrections and improvements which are
far easier to make before the document is submitted to SC22.

Editorial:
- N1192 is not formatted or styled to ISO conventions.
##P.E.Reply> ISO formatting in progress.

- N1192 is incomplete (numerous references to x.y for example).
- Text should not be reproduced from a Sun manual; the text should be
  rewritten and the reference removed.
- The description of the STOP directive (section 7) should be replaced
  by more formal language.
- There is no definition of "rep-char" (used at N1192 R305, defined at
  Part 1 section 4.3.2.1).
- In rule R503, "primary" should be "coco-primary".
##P.E.Reply>
## Yes.
## These have been fixed.

Terminology:
- "1539" should be "1539-1" throughout.
##P.E.Reply>
## Unclear.
## It appears to me that only the final references in 3. GENERAL-
## 1. Scope and 2. Normative References need to be changed as the
## others state "this part of IOS/IEC 1539".

## I am not sure that even these two references need to be changed.
## If I recall correctly, Part 2 refers to 1539 and not to 1539-1.
## I made this change but would like to be sure that this change
## is needed.

- Although it would be absurd to change the word "compilation" to
  "processing" throughout, for consistency with Part 1 the word
  "compiler" should be changed to "processor" (and related word forms)
  where this refers to processing the outcome of the initial selection
  done by coco.
##P.E.Reply>
## Yes.
## This has been fixed.

Comments to the editor:
- Why does the set option (Section 10) deal with only one variable?
  Example 2 in Annex A shows a possible need for two variables.
##P.E.Reply>
## Yes.
## The set option can handle more than one variable.
## The BNF is changed to make this clear.

- What is the output file from Example 1 actually used for?
##P.E.Reply>
## No telling.  One possibility is that it is used as the displayed
## source in a debugger.

- I am slightly uncomfortable that the Level-x expressions do not relate
  to the same number expressions in Part 1 (1,2,3 <=> 2,4,5).  Does this
  matter?
##P.E.Reply>
## Yes it matters that you are slightly uncomfortable :)  I have tried
## both methods of numbering and the current method is more clear.


Morgan

 The document clearly requires editorial corrections.

Zongaro
-------

 - I feel that the CoCo facility is incomplete without a macro expansion
   facility.

##P.E.Reply>
## Noted.

 - I have many technical problems with N1192 (which I will forward to the
   project editor separately).

N1192    No - the document is not ready.  It needs a thorough technical review,
         and lots of editing to make it look like a new part of the standard.
         Some quick points from a cursory glance:
         - The BNF rules are named such that they can be confused with the ones
           in 1539-1 (I suggest something like R3.402, or CCR402, etc.).  This
           is particularly pertinent since the BNF terms <equiv-op> et al are
           used but not defined by N1192 (intending to import them from
           1539-1).
##P.E.Reply>
## Yes.
## The rule numbers now look like CCR402.

         - Lots of "section x.y" references.
         - Initialization expression semantics are imported from 1539-1, but I
           cannot see how these can be applied to CoCo variables. Text is
           needed to define a CoCo-initialization-expr, since otherwise the
           entities allowed by R512 include Fortran PARAMETERs (which I do not
           expect CoCo to be able to evaluate) and exclude CoCo PARAMETERs.
##P.E.Reply>
## Yes.
## These have been fixed.

         - According to 3.2.2, any line that does not begin with "??" is a
           CoCo comment line.  Seems unfortunate for the user program.
##P.E.Reply>
## No.
## Why is this unfortunate?  A "CoCo comment line" is not a Part-1
## "comment line".  We have no idea if the CoCo comment lines are
## valid Fortran source, Cÿ2Dÿ2D source, or other text.

         - 6.0 talks about "execution" of a CoCo program, seeming to mean its
           processing to produce a Fortran program.  I find this model of what
           is going on very difficult to understand or explain.
##P.E.Reply>
## Unclear.
## I am not sure if "processing" CoCo directives will be more clear than
## executing CoCo directives.  I will ask X3J3 and anybody reading this
## note for input.  Input?

         - There is not enough description of what is going on.
##P.E.Reply>
## Unclear.
## Could you be more specific?  Would more examples have helped?

         - IMO a better model would be to include the entire program text as
           being part of the "CoCo program", this CoCo program is then
           processed according to its directives to produce a Fortran program
           for interpretation by 1539-1.

##P.E.Reply>
## Unclear.
## We do not know that the directives will produce a Fortran program.

         I expect that a lot more would come from a further review, but these
         are sufficient reasons to vote No.

There are a considerable number of editorial corrections required before
the document conforms to ISO Directives.  Moreover, as others have pointed
out, there appear to be a substantial number of possible technical errors
and/or ambiguities.  I would be unhappy for this document to be forwarded
to SC22 without further, detailed, technical review by WG5 and X3J3.

Wagener/US
----------

                                                                Our parent
committee had asked us to provide a recommended US position on this issue, on
the assumption that it will come up at the SC22 plenary next month. The TAG
voted to recommend approval of splitting the work item to form Part 3 but to
disapprove adopting N1192 as the content of Part 3 at this time.
[Convenor's comment:  there was never any suggestion that it should be
adopted at the Plenary;  that is NEVER done as far as I am aware. The only
proposals appropriate for the Plenary were the splitting of the Work Item,
appointing of a Project Editor, and obtaining approval for simultaneous
registration and approval ballots;  these actions were all approved by the
Plenary.]  The main
reason is that the US believes that the alternatives did not receive equal
consideration in Dresden (e.g., comparable-style papers were not in the
premeeting; papers on both approaches were not available during much of the
discussion on this topic), and that due process therefore requires further
consideration of the alternatives.

Please record this NO vote as a US country vote (I will support the TAG, so
also record my personal vote the same); for the US to vote YES on the content
of Part 3, there will need to be a "balanced" consideration by WG5 of the
alternatives.

Even if we really want to go down this path, COCO as currently written
doesn't have features that experience has taught us customers
*require* (e.g. macro expansion). So the draft is, at best, incomplete.

Of course, I still maintain that we ought not do this at all (having
researched the topic for the last year or so, on and off) because:

*   preprocessors/conditional compilation does not solve the
    portability problem(s), instead they paper over such problems.
*   Complicate the programming environment (debuggers, browsers etc.)
*   Complicate the compilation system (interferes with program
    database/whole program compilation, various acceleration schemes)
*   Newer languages depreciate their use (e.g. Cÿ2Dÿ2D) or avoid them
    entirely (e.g. Java). Experience has taught us that they are an
    inappropriate solution.

If we are to do it anyway, the imperative of Standardization is to
cannonize existing practice. So we ought to use an "fpp" approach

*     Cannonize most prevalent existing practice
*     Remove worst warts of "cpp" as a Fortran processor
*     Extensive usability testing resulted in keeping more cpp than expected.

Standardization of "coco" will have the unfortunate effect of creating
*more* dialects of preprocessor, not fewer. Opposite the effect
Standardization is supposed to produce. This comes about because:
*     History suggests that old preprocessors don't get abandoned. Any
      large project that uses one now, will continue to use the same
      one indefinitely.
*     Vendors have to continue to support what they have
      now. Virtually all Unix and Unix style vendors support cpp now.
*     Unless a miracle occurs, some vendors will implement and integrate
      COCO at different rates. Thus each user will have to choose between
      fully integrated "c/fpp" and user-hosted or partially supported
      COCO.

Increasing the number of dialects of preprocessor will likely erode
confidence in ISO standards in general, Fortran standards, and most
particularly parts of the standard other than -1.

In addition, vendors (and to a lessor extent users) will be diverted
from working on more important things (e.g. f95, performance,
programming environment work, etc.) which cannot be good for the
future of Fortran as a viable environment.

There are already enough preprocessors available for compilers.
It will complicate portability problems for Fortran.
I believe this should NOT become part of Fortran, it is not a
language feature per se.
