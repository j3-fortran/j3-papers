NUMBER:
TITLE: DEALLOCATE and array pointers
KEYWORDS: DEALLOCATE, array pointers
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

We currently say that one can deallocate an array pointer if it
points to the "whole of an object that was created by allocation".
What exactly does "whole" mean in this rule? 

Specifically, is the following allowed:

REAL, DIMENSION(:), POINTER :: a, b
ALLOCATE(a(1:10))
b=>a(1:10)
DEALLOCATE(b)

ANSWER:

Choice 1. Yes, this is allowed, since "whole" means that b is
ASSOCIATED with all elements of an array that was ALLOCATEd.
In the given example, ASSOCIATED(a,b) is .TRUE., therefore either
a or b can be used to DEALLOCATE the memory.

Choice 2. No, this was not meant to be allowed. "Whole" is meant
to convey that b must be pointer associated with a whole array,
rather than an array section. Since a(1:10) is a section and not
a whole array b cannot be used to deallocate the memory.

Note that some existing compilers implement choice 2, that is,
they give a runtime error when executing the DEALLOCATE statement
above.
