Subject: Passing IO Mode to DTIO routines (Unresolved Issue #30)

The interaction of user specified DTIO routines and the modes
specified in format control and in I/O control lists is leftover
business from 153.  This paper addresses this issue.

Briefly, an intrinsic derived type is defined in the
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module.  An argument
of this type is passed to the user specified DTIO routines.

The INTRINSIC derived type is named ISO_IO_MODE.  The
derived type specifies the current state of the following modes:
BLANK, DECIMAL, PAD, ROUND, SCALE, and SIGN.

192:27+ add paragraph
The child data transfer routine may determine the values of the IO
modes prevailing in the parent data transfer statement at the point
of call via the values of the argument of type ISO_IO_MODE.
These values may be different from those specified on the most
recent OPEN statement for this unit.  The optional argument of
type ISO_IO_MODE shall not be passed to the user defined derived
type data transfer procedure if it is invoked via a call statement.

194:7+ add to Note
INQUIRE will provide values based upon the most recently
executed OPEN statement for this unit.  The values currently
in effect at the point where this child transfer statement was
invoked are contained in the argument of type ISO_IO_MODE.

198:3 replace
"executed." with "executed, unless the INQUIRE statement is
executed from within a child data transfer statement.  If the
INQUIRE statement is executed from within a child data transfer
statement, it returns values in effect prior to the execution of the
ultimate parent of the child data transfer statement.

Variables of this intrinsic derived type are used to pass
the current I/O mode to user specified derived type I/O routines.
