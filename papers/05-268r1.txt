Subject: libm math functions

At Delft, it was decided to pursue the libm procedures.
This paper attempts to provide edits to do so.
The specifications are in 05-132r2, pursuant to J3-038.
In short, this paper provides Fortran standard names
for some procedures already existing in the C language math library
as specified by C99, POSIX, OSF and the SV and BSD implementations;
it does not specify wholly new procedures.  These procedures
are being considered for inclusion in C++08, where they are not
already a part of C++.

As Van has remarked, and apparently resulting from the name-changing
at 173, some of the edits reference the wrong lines.  This version
attempts to repair that error.

Specification: Add subsections to Section 13 detailing
               the Fortran names for these procedures from the C libm:
               j0, j1, jn, y0, y1, yn, erf, erfc, hypot, tgamma, lgamma.
               (Some of the C names should not be used due
               to the common use, in Fortran, of names such as j0 etc.)

                        The functions are (the C names):

                        Bessel functions (j0, j1, jn, y0, y1, yn)
                        Error functions (erf, erfc)
                        Hypotenuse (hypot)
                        Gamma and log gamma (tgamma, lgamma)

                        The detailed mathematical specification of these
                        procedures is given in the references above.
                        The intention is to allow the vendor to use
                        the procedure supplied by libm, so the exact
                        specification is left to libm, which is most likely
                        what the applications programmer wants.

                        The generic names proposed are:

                        BESSEL_J0
                        BESSEL_J1
                        BESSEL_JN
                        BESSEL_Y0
                        BESSEL_Y1
                        BESSEL_YN
                        ERF
                        ERFC
                        GAMMA
                        HYPOT
                        LOG_GAMMA

Syntax:

There is no new syntax.  The procedure names are as above.
The calling sequences are the same one- or two- argument sequences
as the C versions.  Again, this is most likely the most useful
to applications programmers.
