For consideration.

Basic Functionality
===================

Provide a facility to define new types, not type aliases, from existing
types.

Rationale
=========

New types can be used for every purpose for which type aliases are
desired, but there are many things a new type can do that a type alias
cannot.

Type aliases (not new types) were in several drafts for the purpose of |
C interoperability.  All of the functionality specified to justify     |
that project is available by using new types instead of type aliases.  |
Type aliases are not useful for generic resolution, and do not provide |
strong type checking in expressions, assignment, or procedure          |
references.                                                            |
                                                                       |
One of the examples from C interoperability was                        |
                                                                       |
  typedef time_t long;                                                 |
  time_t TimeNow;                                                      |
                                                                       |
interoperates with                                                     |
                                                                       |
  use ISO_C_Binding, only: C_Long                                      |
  integer(c_long) :: TimeNow                                           |
                                                                       |
but there was a desire for                                             |
                                                                       |
  typealias :: Time_t => integer(c_long)                               |
  type(time_t) :: TimeNow                                              |
                                                                       |
In this proposal it would be                                           |
                                                                       |
  type, new :: Time_t => integer(c_long)                               | 
  type(time_t) :: TimeNow                                              | 
                                                                       | 
The difference is that now TimeNow can be used for generic resolution. | 

Here's one example where a new type solves a problem and a type alias
doesn't.  Suppose you have the requirement to evaluate something using,
say, rational approximations, and in some cases you need six digits of
precision while in other cases you need twelve.  Assume the twelve-digit
case is sufficiently more expensive that you want to use the six-digit
version where possible.  With two routines, you use SELECTED_REAL_KIND
to declare their characteristics, and glue them together with a generic
name.  You develop and certify them on a 32-bit machine.  Then you send
your whole program off to production and they can't even compile it
because they use a 64-bit machine where SELECTED_REAL_KIND(6) and
SELECTED_REAL_KIND(12) have the same value.

Estimated Impact on Standard
============================

Minor.

Detailed Specification
======================

Provide syntax to define a new type in terms of an existing one. 
Objects of the type from which new types are created are compatible with
objects of those new types, provided corresponding type parameters have
the same values.  New types inherit operations and type-bound procedures
from the type from which they are created.  Compatibility and
inheritance are already well-described concepts that can be exploited to
simplify description of new type definitions.

Type parameter values for the original type may be specified during the
definition of a new type.  Objects of the new type have those type
parameter values, which cannot be specified during declaration of
objects of the new type.  If values are not specified for type
parameters of the original type, values for those parameters shall be
specified during declarations of objects of the new types.

An already-existing almost-similar example is the type DOUBLE          |
PRECISION.  Objects of that type have the same kind type parameter
value as objects of type REAL(kind(0.0d0)), and a kind type parameter
value cannot be specified during declaration of objects of type DOUBLE
PRECISION.  It is different from this proposal in that DOUBLE          |
PRECISION is the same as type REAL(kind(0.0d0))                        |

Concrete syntax can be decided in due course.

Example:

  type, new :: Real6 => Real(selected_real_kind(6))
  type, new :: Real12 => Real(selected_real_kind(12))

or

  new type :: Real6 => Real(selected_real_kind(6))
  new type :: Real12 => Real(selected_real_kind(12))

wherein the blank in "new type" is optional.

Types Real6 and Real12 are distinct types, even if their type parameter
values are the same.  Therefore generic interfaces continue to work,
even if SELECTED_REAL_KIND(6) and SELECTED_REAL_KIND(12) have the same
value.

Generic programming using, e.g. parameterized modules, is not helpful  |
for this problem because the procedures would be almost completely     |
different, although the argument and result types could be             |
parameterized.  This is only marginally helpful.                       |
