Discussion:

The wording in 09-007 describing variables of type LOCK_TYPE (lock
variables) lack precision and clarity.

Background:

The intent is that a lock variable may have two "states", locked and
unlocked. One value corresponds to the unlocked state, and is the same
value as the structure constructor LOCK_TYPE().  Many values may
represent the locked state, with the value depending on which image
currently holds the lock. While there is no specified definition of
the type, it is helpful to consider the simplest, most obvious
possibility:

type lock_type
   integer(atomic_int_kind),private :: owner = 0
end lock_type

The unlocked state corresponds to the owner component having the value
0. The locked state corresponds to the owner component value equal to
the image number of the image that executed a LOCK statement to change
the owner value from 0. With this model, execution of a simple LOCK
statement becomes an atomic operation of {If owner == 0, set owner =
this_image()}. Execution of a simple UNLOCK statement becomes an
atomic operation of {If owner == this_image(), set owner = 0}.

After consideration, it was determined that the material in 6.2.2 is
better located in 13. Paper 09-143r2 contains the edits for clause 13.
