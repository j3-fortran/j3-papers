Subject:  Post Fortran 2003: Type aliases

Summary
______________________________________

I believe that Fortran should provide some form of type aliases. They were 
deleted from the draft because of problems with the original design and lack 
of time. I explain below why they are needed, other then saving keystrokes or 
writing clearer code.

Motivation
______________________________________

Consider writing a Fortran interface to the MPICH implementation of MPI. 
Typically, this will be a module that contains various constants, type 
parameters, and interfaces. MPI uses many typealiases, which are needed when 
writing interfaces. For example, MPI_Datatype is typically an alias for int. 
But one cannot assume this, nor that it is indeed an integer. One cannot get 
away with our untyped C_PTR, since arguments of type MPI_Datatype are passed 
by value, not by reference. It is necessary for any kind of portability that 
one be able to write:

TYPEALIAS :: MPI_Datatype=>INTEGER(KIND=C_INT)

in the module for the interface to MPICH.

This kind of situation occurs in almost all C libraries I have interfaced 
with. I typically use macros to hide what exactly something like MPI_Datatype 
is. It is a shame that Fortran 2003 did not make interfacing to C possible 
without preprocessing or other dirty tricks!
