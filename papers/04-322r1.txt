Subject: Referencing deferred bindings

The question has been revised to make it meaningful (it was missing the
NOPASS attribute).  If option 1 of the interp in 323r1 passes, tbis
interp becomes subsumed.  Otherwise, an edit is suggested.

TITLE: Referencing deferred bindings
KEYWORDS: Type-bound procedure, deferred binding
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION: I thought that the intent was that it would be
impossible to reference a deferred binding.  However, it
doesn't appear to me that this intent was achieved.
Consider the following program (Sorry, but I don't have
any compilers up to syntax-checking this).

  program defer

    type, abstract :: t
    contains
      procedure (sub), nopass, deferred :: deferred_proc
    end type t
    type, extends(t) :: t2
    contains
      procedure :: deferred_proc => sub2
    end type t2

    class(t), pointer :: x

    nullify(x)
    call x%deferred_proc

  contains
    subroutine sub
      write (*,*) 'Hello.'
    end subroutine sub
    subroutine sub2
      write (*,*) 'Goodbye.'
    end subroutine sub2
  end program defer

Is this a valid program?  If not, what restriction of the
standard does it violate?

Note that x%deferred_proc does not require the value of x (4.5.7)
and thus is not a reference to x (2.5.6).  Therefore, [83:23-24]
does not prohibit this.  Nor is it clear that there is an intent
to prohibit invocation of type-bound procedures for disassociated
pointer objects; except in the case of deferred bindings, this
seems well-defined and potentially useful.

Because x is disassociated, its dynamic type is the same
as its declared type, thus making the interpretation of
x%nondeferred_proc reasonably clear.

ANSWER:

No, this was not intended to be a valid program.
An edit is supplied to clarify this situation.

EDITS:

[266:24+] Insert
"C1224a (R1219) If <binding-name> is that of a deferred type-bound
        procedure, or is generically resolved to a specific deferred
        type-bound procedure, <data-ref> shall not be a disassociated
        pointer, an undefined pointer, or an unallocated allocatable
        variable."
