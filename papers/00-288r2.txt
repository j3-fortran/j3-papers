A user specified derived type input/output procedure maybe called
explicitly by the programmer or implicitly by a DT format
specifier.  It may be called from different data transfer
statements which may be applying different formats,
different units, different records, etc.

Some of these items may be changed by the child but for
others it makes no sense to allow changes.

This paper sets ID, POS, and REC as unchangeable
by a child data transfer procedure.

EDITS:

180:17 before '.'
"; it shall not be specified in a child data transfer statement"

180:19 replace
"; otherwise, it" with ". A child data transfer statement
is a direct access data transfer statement when the parent is a direct
access data transfer statement.  Any other data transfer statement"

180:24+
A child data transfer statement shall not specify the POS= specifier.

182:7+
A child data transfer statement shall not specify the ID= specifier.

194:19+ add Note:

POS=, or REC= specifiers in an input/output control list.
