DISCUSSION

Requirement 8(c) in N1820 says that the lower bounds for an
assumed-shape dummy (or an assumed-rank dummy that is not allocatable
or pointer) are assumed to be zero, as opposed to the default of 1
in Fortran.

However, this is inconsistent with the way the lower bound is treated
for other sorts of arrays. A C descriptor describes a Fortran object
(see the text in 5.1).  And the text at [10:16] says that the lower
bound should be provided. No edits are needed, but a note will be
helpful.

NOTE 5.4
A Fortran procedure with an assumed-shape dummy argument takes no
account of the lower bounds of the corresponding actual argument.
C code that is calling such a procedure therefore does not need to
provide values for the lower-bound members of the elements of the dim
member of the C descriptor for the assumed-shape array. However,
Fortran code does provide these data in a C descriptor for an
assumed-size dummy array and they may be accessed in C code that is
called.
