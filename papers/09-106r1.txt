1.  The problem

Shouldn't scaling be done as in 10.8.5p3 no matter what I/O rounding
mode is in effect?

The caveat "If UP,..." appears not to have a reason.

2.  Edits

[263:27: 10.8.5p3] Delete "If ... effect," from 10.8.5p3.

[263:28-31] Make the list items independent paragraphs, properly
capitalized and punctuated, deleting ", and" from the end of the first
one.
