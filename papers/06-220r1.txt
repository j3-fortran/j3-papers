Subject: C10 - UTI 48 : List-directed bits output
Date:    16-aug-2006

---------------------

Unresolved Technical Issue 48 (page 282) Asks three questions: Why are
leading zeros considered significant in list-directed output for bits?
Why is Z format user rather than B?  What is the exact meaning of
(k+3)/4 ?


Reply:

1) Even in the bits context, users might prefer output not to have
   long strings of leading zeroes.  They can infer the zeroes while
   saving ink on their printouts.  Other users can get explicit leading zeroes
   if they explicitly specify the format using (say) Zn.n.

2) The selection of Z format for list-directed output is mainly for
   practical considerations.  B format output results in
   significantly long, and in some cases, impractically long output
   strings.  The use of Z format allows compact output from which the
   reader can easily visualize the represented bit pattern.

3) The  (k+3)/4 is not an issue when leading zeroes are not
   required to be printed.
