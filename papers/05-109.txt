NUMBER:  F03/0030
TITLE:  IEEE divide by zero
KEYWORDS: IEEE-754, divide-by-zero
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum ???
STATUS: For consideration

QUESTION:

Is infinity / 0.0 a divide by zero exception?
Is NaN / 0.0 a divide by zero exception?

DISCUSSION:

Fortran 2003 defines (in 14.2) infinity / zero and NaN / zero
cases as IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO.  IEEE-754 defines (in 6.1 and 6.2)
those two as unexceptional.

ANSWER:

EDITS:

All edits refer to 04-007.pdf.

[365:18] Change "nonzero numerator" to "finite nonzero
numerator".
