Subject: Contiguous TARGET dummy arguments
From: Malcolm Cohen
Date: 2008 May 14

1. Introduction

Now that the standard has gone to all the trouble of defining contiguity,
including compile-time (viz "simple") contiguity, we can move some of the
processor-dependent TARGET cases into the guaranteed-to-be-associated box.
That is, require the processor not to use copy-in/out for those cases.

It would be possible to require lack of copy-in/out for all contiguous
actual arguments, but that might cause complications for some vendors.
However, it is certainly reasonable to require lack of copy-in/out for
actual argument that are "simply contiguous", i.e. definitely known at
compile time to be contiguous.

2. Edits

[290:12.5.2.4p9] Change "is either a" to
  "either the effective argument is simply contiguous or the dummy argument
   is".
{Put simply contiguous actuals into the guaranteed-to-be-associated box.}

[290:12.5.2.4p10] After "but" insert "is not simply contiguous and".
{Take simply contiguous actuals out of the processor-dependent box).}
