A cross-reference would be helpful for END=, ERR=, and EOR= in the
bullet list of 2.3.5 Execution sequence.  The first three bullets all
have cross-references included, so adding one here seems appropriate.

In 2.4.7 we say a coarray can be referenced or defined "by any
image". Saying "any" was not true for stopped images in Fortran 2008,
and for more cases in Fortran 2015. Instead, say "other images".

[35:20] In 2.3.5 Execution sequence, in the bullet list at the end of
paragraph 2, in bullet 4, after "EOR= specifiers" insert " (9.11)".

[39:7] In 2.4.7 Coarray, paragraph 1, change "defined by any image" to
"defined by other images".
