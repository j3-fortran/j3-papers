NUMBER: F18/024
TITLE:  CFI_setpointer with result a deferred length character
KEYWORDS: C interoperability
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Submitted


1. Description of the issue

Section 18.5.5.9 "The CFI_setpointer function" states in para 2 that

"If source is not a null pointer, the corresponding values of the
elem_len, rank, and type members shall be the same in the C
descriptors with the addresses source and result."

The function can therefore not work correctly if the "result"
parameter is a descriptor address for a deferred-length character
entity coming in from Fortran, because the elem_len value is not
available. Manual updates to result->elem_len are prohibited by 18.6
para 1.

The text at [478:21] specifically allows interoperable interfaces with
a dummy argument of type CHARACTER that has deferred character length,
so setting a pointer within C of this nature to be associated with a
CHARACTER pointer of specified element length should be allowed.
 
Within Fortran

CHARACTER(len=4), TARGET :: source
CHARACTER(len=:), POINTER :: result
result => source

will work just fine, so this surely is a defect in the current
specification.


2. Suggested resolution


For the case of a character pointer in a call to CFI_setpointer,

- permit result->elem_len having a different value than
  source->elem_len if the source and result are descriptors for a data
  entity of type CHARACTER and result has a deferred length, and

- for this case, enforce overwriting result->elem_len with the value
  of source->elem_len.


3. Suggested edits against 18-007r1


In 18.5.5.9 The CFI_setpointer function

- [491:27] In the description of the source formal parameter, second
  sentence, delete "elem_len, ".

- [491:28+] In the description of the source formal parameter, after
  the second sentence add new sentence:

  "If source is not a null pointer and the C descriptor with the
  address result does not describe a deferred length character
  pointer, the corresponding values of the elem_len member shall be
  the same in the C descriptors with the addresses source and result."

- [491:31] In the first sentence of paragraph 3, "Description" replace
  "base_addr and dim" by "base_addr, dim and possibly elem_len".

- [491:38] At the end of the second bullet point of paragraph 3,
  "Description", add new sentence;

  "If the C descriptor with the address result describes a character
  pointer of deferred length, the value of its elem_len member is set
  to source->elem_len".
