     True, but Part 1 does specify (2.4.3.1.2) that a constant is either a
named constant or a literal constant, and that a named constant has the
PARAMETER attribute.  I don't think the draft of Part 3 specifies the
definition of a named constant.  You don't necessarily have to make it a
constraint, but you should say it somewhere.

#DE# Accepted.  A constraint has been added.

     Section 3.3 of Part 1 has a reference to 4.3.2.1, which explicitly states
which characters are permitted in a character context.

#DE# No change.  Section CC3.1 also has a reference to 4.3.2.1.

     At the beginning of Section 5, it's stated that "All of its attributes
may be included in a type declaration statement or may be specified
individually in separate specification statements."

#DE# Accepted.  The beginning of Section CC4 has changed.

     I think so.  The current constraint reads, "A <coco-object-name> shall not
be the same as any other <coco-object-name>."  Normally, a constraint applies
to the syntax items that appear in the immediately preceding syntax rules, so
I take this to say that a <coco-object-name> in a single <coco-type-spec> must
not appear more than once.  So the way the current constraint reads, it sounds
like this would be permitted:

    ??  INTEGER :: NAME
    ??  LOGICAL :: NAME

#DE# Accepted.  The constraint has changed.

     Simply that you have to define what "ÿ2D" means, and what ".and." means,
etc.  But it looks like you've done that.

#DE# OK.

     OK, but what if I what to inform a user about the implications of any
command-line values that they've specified?  That is, things that aren't
necessarily errors.

#DE# I don't understand your concerns.

     Is it possible to set them apart as a list of rules, and require a
processor to detect violations of syntax and constraints, along with those
rules?

#DE# Don't know.  I will ask X3J3 for guidance on this topic.
