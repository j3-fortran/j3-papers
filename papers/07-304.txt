Discussion

The point that is being made here is that a single argument association
on a single image allows the image to access a corresponding actual
co-array on the image (that is not new) and also on all other images
(this is new).

We have reworded the note and its example to make this clearer.


Edit to 07-007r3:

[316:28+] In 12.5.2.8 Co-array arguments, replace NOTE 12.30 by

    Consider the invocation of a procedure on a particular image.
    Each dummy co-array is associated with its ultimate argument
    on the image. In addition, during this execution of this procedure,
    this image can access the co-array corresponding to the ultimate
    argument on any other image.  For example, consider

         INTERFACE
            SUBROUTINE SUB(X)
               REAL :: X[*]
            END SUBROUTINE SUB(X)
         END INTERFACE
          ...
         REAL :: A(1000)[:]
          ...
         CALL SUB(A(10))

    During execution of this invocation of SUB, the executing image
    has access through the syntax X[P] to A(10) on image P.
