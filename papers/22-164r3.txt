Flang Open-Source Fortran Report
================================

Flang is an open-source compiler for Fortran.  It is an official
subproject of the LLVM Project (llvm.org).  NVIDIA's portion of the work
is partially sponsored by the US Department of Energy
Exascale Computing Project (particularly, LLNL, Sandia and LANL).

The goals of the project are to
    - Create a new, open source Fortran 2018 compiler with
      Apache 2.0 licensing,
    - that can be used for language and parallelization
      experimentation,
    - that exists as a peer in the LLVM community of languages,
      like Clang,
    - that can rely on LLVM code generation and parallelism
      support for CPUs and GPUs.

There is a Slack workspace for Flang and a number of conference calls
related to Flang development.
    - Flang biweekly sync call ("umbrella call")
    - Flang biweekly technical call
    - "Classic Flang" biweekly call
    - OpenMP in Flang Technical Call

The New LLVM Flang Compiler
---------------------------

The new front-end is available at https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project
(the LLVM monorepo) in the flang/ directory.

LLVM Flang is being developed under the Apache 2.0 license with LLVM
exceptions (the same as LLVM, Clang, OpenMP, etc.).

Recent efforts have concentrated on
    - upstreaming the remaining lowering code from the 'fir-dev' branch to
      LLVM 'main'.
    - As of June 30, 2022, upstreaming is complete and no more development
      will occur in the 'fir-dev' branch. All new development will now go
      right into LLVM 'main'.
    - Testing. NVIDIA now runs approximately 15,500 tests on flang nightly.
      More than 85% of the tests are from the Numerical Algorithms Group
      (NAG). The tests guided us to prepare the compiler for a wider
      audience by emitting TODO messages for unimplemented features,
      improving error messages, and fixing compiler crashes and assertion
      failures.

Flang Front-End Work that has been completed in Q2 (i.e., between April
1, 2022, and June 30, 2022):

Development of Fortran semantic analysis continues. Semantic testing with
the NAG test suites and NVIDIA's internal test suites serve as a guidepost
for the front-end work. NVIDIA runs over 13,000 NAG tests on a nightly
basis. We also addressed a handful of issues reported on GitHub by the
Flang Community. There were 147 merges to llvm-project/main related to
Flang's parsing and/or semantics during Q2.

Flang Lowering work that has been completed in Q2 (i.e., between
April 1, 2022, and June 30, 2022):

Note: Lowering is the translation of Fortran syntax into the
semantic-based Fortran IR (FIR) and then into LLVM IR.

Lowering features completed in Q2 include:
    * Set lower bounds to 1 when assigning an array section to a pointer.
    * Handle reversed bounds and negative bounds in ALLOCATE statements.
    * FORALL statement enhancements
      - Detect overlaps when the LHS is used to index itself
         (e.g., a(a(i)) = i).
      - Support basic pointer assignments inside FORALLs (i.e.: no
         assignment to pointer components) and add TODO for the rest.
      - Hoist RHS scalar outside of FORALL loops.
      - Better support for FORALL where the indices do not appear in the
         left-hand side expression.
      - Fix temp deallocation issue in user assignments inside FORALL.
      - Detect overlapping assignment with substrings inside FORALL.
    * Support default assignment between derived types that are the same
      but declared in deferent scopes (F2018 7.5.2.4).
    * Procedures calls and definitions
      - Support internal subprogram in alternate entry point.
      - Support passing to OPTIONAL VALUE dummy arguments.
      - Avoid clash between several procedure with the same Fortran name
        but different BIND(C) names.
      - Support ENTRY points appearing in generic interface.
      - Support all kinds of ENTRY point dummy arguments appearing in one
        entry point but not in some others.
      - Support calling functions whose result depends on a host procedure
        variable inside an internal procedure.
    * Intrinsic procedures
      - Support PRESENT with optional dummy procedures.
      - Handle dynamically optional argument in EXIT,
        GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT, and GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE.
      - LBOUND and UBOUND fixes.
      - ICHAR of ISO_10646 to default integer was hitting a MLIR verifier.
      - MERGE with logical arguments that are both variables and
        expressions.
    * Variable lowering
      - Support implied shape PARAMETERs indexing by non-constant indices.
      - Respect BIND( C ) on in the mangling of module and common block
        variables.
    * Expression lowering
      - Support lowering of Nan and Inf constant literals.
      - Fix MLIR type mismatch coming from FIR real types being used with
        MLIR real types in COMPLEX expressions.
      - Fixing issue addressing multi-dimensional arrays mixing compile
        time constant and non-constant extents.
      - Fixing character arrays indexing.
      - Fixing array section indexing issue caused by bad fir.box_addr
        folding after lowering.
    * IO statements
      - Update asynchronous IO runtime calls to the new API.
      - Use descriptors to output reals that are not f32 or f64.
    * Destroy the selector in a select case construct after usage if it
      is a temporary variable.
    * Other improvements or nonfunctional changes
      - Use current location when lowering compiler generated symbols that
        have no source location.
      - Catch unit number out of range in I/O with a runtime check.
      - Nonfunctional changes (function renaming, comment clean-up, etc.).
      - Transform asserts into clearer TODO messages.
      - Add support to detect and lower intrinsic module procedures.
        Implement IEEE_IS_FINITE, IEEE_CLASS_EQ , IEEE_CLASS_NE,
        IEEE_ROUND_EQ, IEEE_ROUND_NE, and add TODOs for the rest.
      - Use MLIR math operations to lower Fortran math intrinsics when the
        MLIR operations exist and exact precision is not required.

Runtime Changes in Q2 (i.e., between April 1, 2022, and
June 30, 2022):

    There were 82 merges made to llvm-project/main that affected the Flang
    IO and runtime support library.

The current state of the LLVM Flang compiler is
    - Written in modern C++ following LLVM conventions
    - Over 200,000 lines of code, tests and scripts
    - Parses all of Fortran 2018 to abstract syntax trees (AST)
    - Parses  OpenMP 4.5 and some OpenMP 5.0
    - Parses OpenACC 3.0
    - Defines a "Fortran Intermediate Representation" (FIR) based on
      LLVM's MLIR
    - Can lower most OpenMP and OpenACC constructs. We do not currently
      lower any of the target/device constructs in OpenMP.
    - Can compile and correctly run Fortran 77 programs (passes FCVS
      test suite) and nearly all Fortran 95 programs.
    - Can compile and run programs that use most OpenMP 1.1 features
      and some task and simd constructs. OpenMP 1.1 features that still
      need to be added are lastprivate, reduction, default clause and some
      atomic constructs.

Upcoming work:
    - Retool our internal development process, build automation, and test
      framework to work directly in llvm-project now that upstreaming is
      complete and fir-dev is closed. Reviews and commits for Flang going
      forward will be done directly in open source.
    - Repoint our internal testing to llvm-project to identify regressions
      and improvements.
    - Create a design document for array and character lowering and
      propose an update of the expression lowering design with the
      objectives of filling the functional gaps of the current framework
      and making the framework easier to understand, more auditable, and
      extendable. The proposal will cover all of Fortran, through Fortran
      2018, and include a plan to transition from the current framework.
      Depending on the community feedback, it is expected that the
      implementation work could also start in Q3.
    - Propose designs for the lowering of polymorphic types and
      parameterized derived types (PDTs). Depending on the community
      feedback, we expect to start implementation work on at least one of
      these two features in Q3.
    - Continue to address runtime errors that are not blocked by
      not-yet-implemented messages and are not covered by the in-progress
      design documents.


Current ("Classic") Flang Compiler
----------------------------------

The previous version of Flang, now known as Classic Flang, is derived from
the PGI Fortran compiler, with some proprietary features removed (e.g.,
OpenACC support, inter-procedure analysis). It is the basis for commercial
Fortran compilers from Arm, AMD, and Huawei.

Classic Flang is available for Linux on x86-64, OpenPOWER, and Arm
processors. OpenPower support is not currently being maintained but it is
still available.

The Classic Flang Community has made progress with bug fixes. Support for
Mac and Windows architectures, quad-precision, and improved debug support
are also in progress.
