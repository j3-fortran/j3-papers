Subject:    Edits for Destructors

1. Introduction

This paper contains edits to implement the syntax and specifications of
destructors as described in 00-271.

2. Organisation and Terminology

The terminology we'll use should be clear from 00-271:
  "finalization"
     - whatever it is that we do immediately before destroying a
derived-type
       object (either calling a user procedure or not).
  "final subroutines"
     - the user-defined procedures that get called before object
destruction.
  "finalizable"
     - a type (or object) needs finalization.

Most of this will go into chapter 4 (for derived types), since they only
apply to derived types.

3. Specs and Syntax Changes and Clarifications

The following additional requirements on user-defined final subroutines are
proposed:

(1) All nonkind type parameters of the dummy argument shall be assumed.
    - Rationale: It seems desirable to require the finalizer not to have a
      runtime check before being called or to have potential runtime
      non-conformance.
(2) The dummy argument shall not be INTENT(OUT).
    - RAT: This would automatically cause an infinite loop, which is
      undesirable.

[43:22+] Insert new bnf and constraint
  "<<or>> FINAL [ :: ] final-subroutine-name-list

   Constraint: If FINAL is present, the derived type shall not have the
               SEQUENCE or BIND(C) attributes.

   Constraint: <final-subroutine-name> shall be a module procedure with
               exactly one dummy argument.  That argument shall be a
               nonpointer nonallocatable nonpolymorphic variable of the
               derived type being defined.  All nonkind type parameters
               of the dummy argument shall be assumed.  The dummy argument
               shall not be INTENT(OUT).

   Constraint: A <final-subroutine-name> shall not be one that previously
had
               been specified as a final subroutine in that type.

   Constraint: A final subroutine shall not have a dummy argument of the
same
               kind type parameters and rank as the dummy argument of
another
               final subroutine of that derived type."
{Add syntax for user to declare final subroutines.
 The final constraint requires the final subroutines to be generically
 disambiguatable a la 14.1.2.3 without actually putting them into a generic
 set.}

[50:44+] Insert new section
  "4.5.1.8a Final subroutines

{NOTE TO EDITOR: Please insert "final subroutines" into the index.}
   The FINAL keyword specifies a list of <<final subroutines>>.  These
   subroutines may be executed when an object of that type is finalized
   (4.5.7a).

   A derived type is <<finalizable>> if it has any final subroutines, or if
   it has any nonpointer nonallocatable component whose type is finalizable.
   An object is finalizable if its type is finalizable.

   Note 4.38a:
   Final subroutines are effectively always "accessible".  They are called
   for object finalization regardless of the accessibility of the type, its
   other type-bound procedure bindings, or the subroutine name itself.

   Note 4.38b:
   Final subroutines are not inherited through type extension and cannot be
   overridden.  The final subroutines of a base type are called
   after calling any additional final subroutines of an extended type.
"
{Basic definitions.
 Maybe note 4.38b belongs in 4.5.3?  It anyway uses slightly wrong terms.}

[52:40] Before "procedure bindings" insert "non-final".
{Final procedure bindings are not inherited.}

[57:12+] Insert new section
  "4.5.7a The finalization process

{NOTE TO EDITOR: Please insert "finalization" into the index.}
   When a finalizable object is <<finalized>>, the following steps are
carried
   out in sequence:
     (1) If the object has a final subroutine whose dummy argument has the
same
         kind type parameters and rank as the object being finalized, it is
         called with the object as an actual argument.  If there is no such
         subroutine, but there is an elemental final subroutine with the
same
         kind type parameters as the object being finalized, it is called
with
         the object as an actual argument.  If no final subroutine fulfills
         these requirements, no subroutine is called at this point.
     (2) Each finalizable component that appears in the type definition is
         finalized.
{NOTE TO J3, NOT THE STANDARD: This excludes inherited components.
 Alternative wording would be "Each finalizable non-inherited component
is..."}
     (3) If the object is of extended type and the parent type is
finalizable,
         the parent component is finalized.

   If several objects are to be finalized at the same time, the order in
which
   they are finalized is processor-dependent.  A final subroutine shall not
   reference or define an object that has already been finalized.

   4.5.7b When finalization occurs

   A pointer or allocatable object is finalized when it is deallocated.  If
   it is polymorphic, the dynamic type determines which final subroutines
are
   executed.

   A nonpointer nonallocatable object that is not a dummy argument or
function
   result is finalized immediately before it would become undefined due to
   execution of a RETURN or END statement (14.7.6, item (3)).

   If a finalizable object is defined in a module and there are no longer
any
   active procedures referencing the module, it is processor-dependent
whether
   it is finalized.  If the object is not finalized, it retains its
definition
   status and does not become undefined.

   If an executable construct references a function whose result is
   finalizable, the result is finalized after execution of the innermost
   executable construct containing the reference.
{NOTE TO J3, NOT THE STANDARD: An ordinary executable statement - such as an
 assignment statement - is in itself an executable construct.)

   If a specification expression in a scoping unit references a function
whose
   result is finalizable, the result is finalized before execution of the
first
   executable statement in the scoping unit.

   When a procedure is invoked, a nonpointer nonallocatable object that is
an
   actual argument associated with an INTENT(OUT) dummy argument is
finalized.

   When an intrinsic assignment statement is executed, the <variable> is
   finalized before the assignment takes place.

   If an object is allocated via pointer allocation and later becomes
   unreachable due to all pointers to that object having their pointer
   association status changed, it is processor dependent whether it is
   finalized.  If it is finalized, it is processor dependent as to when
   the final subroutines are called.

   4.5.7c Objects that are not finalized

   If program execution is terminated, either by an error (e.g. an
allocation
   failure) or by execution of a STOP or END PROGRAM statement, no objects
   existing immediately prior to termination are finalized.

   A nonpointer nonallocatable object that has the SAVE attribute or which
   occurs in the main program is never finalized.

   A variable in a module is not finalized if it retains its definition
   status and value, even when there is no active procedure referencing
   the module."

[358:23+] Insert
  "(g) Finalizable variables that are not finalized and are accessed from a
       module that is not referenced either directly or indirectly by any
other
       scoping unit that is making either a direct or indirect reference to
the
       subprogram."

       DO i=LBOUND(x,1),UBOUND(x,1)
         IF (ASSOCIATED(x(i)%vector)) DEALLOCATE(x(i)%vector)

     TYPE(t(KIND(0.0d0))) d(n,n)

     ! Returning from this subroutine will effectively do
     !    CALL finalize_t1s(a)
     !    CALL finalize_t1v(b)
     !    CALL finalize_t2e(d)
     ! No final subroutine will be called for variable C because the user
     ! omitted to define a suitable specific procedure for it.

     END TYPE
     TYPE,EXTENDS(t1) :: t2
