Subject: FORALL example illustrating local type spec
Date: 2008 February 12

The editor has suggested the desirability of an example showing the use
of a <type-spec> in a FORALL header.

[178:1-]------------------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Insert a new note after Note 7.55:

   "The type and kind of the \si{index-name} variables may be declared
    independently of the type of any normal variable in the scoping unit.
    For example, in

      SUBROUTINE s(a)
        IMPLICIT NONE
        INTEGER, PARAMETER :: big = SELECTED_INT_KIND(18)
        REAL a(:,:), x, theta
        ...
        FORALL ( INTEGER(big) :: x=1:SIZE(a,1,big), y=1:SIZE(a,2,big), &
               & a(x,y) /= 0 )
          a(x,y) = 1 / a(x,y)**2
        END FORALL
        ...

    the kind of the \si{index-name}s X and Y is selected to be big enough
    for subscript values even if the array A has more than $2^{31}$
    elements.  Since the type of the \si{index-name}s X and Y in the
    FORALL construct is declared explicitly in the FORALL header, it is
    not necessary for integer variables of the same names to be declared
    in the containing scoping unit.  In this example, there is a variable
    X of type real declared in the containing scoping unit, and no
    variable Y declared in the containing scoping unit."
