With large modules with many names, perhaps long names, it
may be difficult, unclear or inconvenient to use most of the names
present while excluding a few (perhaps to prevent collisions).
Adding a EXCEPT clause to the USE statement solves the problem.

This feature is proposed in response to an informal Fortran 2003
comment from Australia (no formal comment was received).
The spelling is changed from NOT to EXCEPT in response
to a suggestion received.

At M167 the Hate .. Love vote was 1 - 1 - 8 - 2.

Title: USE EXCEPT:

Submitted By: J3

Status: For Consideration

References: J3/03-106, J3/04-114

Basic Functionality: A syntax to list names not to have use association
                     when using a module.

Rationale:  When using a module with many public names, a few may be
            unwanted.  Specifying those few is easier than naming
            the many wanted names, and less ugly than fanciful renames.

Estimated Impact: 4 on the John Reid scale at 167

Detailed Specification: Add a clause to the USE statement
                        specifying names not available via use association.

                        If EXCEPT: <list> is present, ONLY must not be present,
                        and there can be no renames (in the <list>).  (It makes no
                        sense to say "don't use this name, and call it 'foo'".)

                        If any USE statement for a given module in a scoping unit
                        has an EXCEPT, all use statements for that module
                        in that scoping unit must have an EXCEPT clause.
                        The effective EXCEPT list is the concatenation
                        of all the EXCEPT lists naming the given module.
