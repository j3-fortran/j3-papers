000010       Meaning of embedded blanks in namelist input
               name

  RichB's YES comment on 000010

    COMMENT:  I do not see the ambiguity John Reid refers too, but I
      do not object to his proposed edit either.

  Craig's NO vote on 000010

    NO:  I agree with Dick Hendrickson and John Reid.  I support John
      Reid's proposed edit.  If the proposed edit is included, then I
      will change my vote to "Yes".

  DickH's NO vote on 000010

    NO:  I agree with John Reid's comment.  It is confusing when the
      second line in the section refers to "object name or subobject
      designator".  The first line of 10.9 refers to "name-value
      sequences" and then gives two forms for "name" in the second
      line.  I think John's edit clarifies the intent.  I also think
      it is minor enough that /INTERP could paste it in the answer
      unless someone disagrees.

      EDIT: Replace the last sentence of subclause 10.9.1.1
        [179:32-33] by
           In the input record, each object name or subobject
           designator may be preceded and followed by one or more
           optional blanks but shall not contain embedded blanks.

  BillL's No vote on 000010

    NO:  We would prefer the EDIT text supplied by John Reid.  Also,
      the ANSWER: contains a reference to section 19.9.1.1, which
      should be 10.9.1.1.

  Toon's NO vote on 000010

    NO:  This is something that will keep confusing people who use
      fixed format source code, because the rules are much stricter
      than for variable names / array items in (fixed form) source
      code.  However, we think the answer is correct.  Nevertheless,
      we prefer John Reid's edit.

  John Reid's e-mail comment on 000010

    Section 10.9 starts (178:30) with the terminology of the rest of
    the standard and uses the words 'object name or subobject
    designator'.  Unfortunately, it goes on to use 'name' for either
    of these. This results in an ambiguity at 179:32-33. It is used
    with its proper meaning on lines 29 and 30, and with its more
    general meaning on line 31. I think that an edit is essential. I
    suggest:

    EDIT: Replace the last sentence of subclause 10.9.1.1 [179:32-33]
      by
        In the input record, each object name or subobject designator
        may be preceded and followed by one or more optional blanks
        but shall not contain embedded blanks.

000012       Evaluation of Intrinsic Procedures

  BillL's NO vote on 000012

    NO:  The proposed text for the ANINT function could be
      interpreted to say that the value returned is of type integer,
      though it is actually REAL. The word 'integer' needs to be
      replaced by 'whole number'.

000018       ELEMENTAL procedures with no arguments

  Malcolm's YES comment on 000018

    COMMENT:  I agree with John Reid's comment.

  Craig's NO vote on 000018

    NO:  I agree with Dick Hendrickson and John Reid.  I support John
      Reid's proposed edit in 12.4.3 [206:7-10].

  DickH's NO vote on 000018

    NO:  Typo:  In the first line of the interp "IS" should be "ISO".

      I also agree with John's comment.  We should cover the case
      where there are arguments that don't match with OUT arguments.

      Replace the final sentence of subclause 12.4.3 [206:7-10] by:
        A reference to an elemental subroutine (12.7) is an
        elemental reference if there is at least one actual argument
        corresponding to an INTENT(OUT) or INTENT(INOUT) dummy
        argument, all such actual arguments are arrays, and all
        actual arguments are conformable.

  Mike's YES comment on 000018

    COMMENT:  none received

  Van's YES comment on 000018

    COMMENT:  Modulo typos -- either "h" -> "h2" everywhere, or
      vice-versa.

  BillL's YES comment on 000018

    COMMENT:  We would prefer the EDIT text supplied by John Reid.
      References to "h2" should be changed to "h", as pointed out by
      others.

  John Reid's e-mail comment on 000018

    For the first edit, I think we need to allow for the case where
    there are some actual arguments, but none correspond to
    intent(inout) or intent(out) dummy arguments. I suggest:

    Replace the final sentence of subclause 12.4.3 [206:7-10] by:
      A reference to an elemental subroutine (12.7) is an elemental
      reference if there is at least one actual argument
      corresponding to an INTENT(OUT) or INTENT(INOUT) dummy
      argument, all such actual arguments are arrays, and all actual
      arguments are conformable.

    I think the line number for the second edit should be 30.

    The sentence in parentheses after the second edit should be
    deleted (it is a note to J3).

000021       Restrictions on <generic-spec> on END INTERFACE

  Kurt's no vote on 000021

    NO:  This is one of two interpretations in this batch where I
      disagree with the proposed technical outcome.  I believe that
      ".ne." should be considered "identical" to ".NE." (because they
      are constructed from characters that are syntactically
      equivalent), but that it should not be considered "identical"
      to "/=" (because they are _different_ syntactic constructs that
      happen to refer to the same semantic concepts).  [I don't
      expect to prevail on this point, but I just couldn't bring
      myself to approve example 1.]

  BillL's NO vote on 000021

    NO:  The proposal to allow the equivalence of .NE. and /=, and
      related pairs, seems misguided. While some implementations
      might choose to allow this equivalence as an extension, the
      stricter requirement of textual equivalence is valuable to the
      user and should be allowed for a standard conforming processor.
      Including the generic name on an END INTERFACE allows a user to
      easily locate the beginning and end of the interface in a text
      editor. Relaxing the standard to allow textually inequivalent
      names diminishes this functionality, and does not supply any
      compensating benefit.

000022       Use of NULL() as initialization

  John Reid's e-mail comment on 000022

    In the first edit, R429a should be on one line.

000023       Termination of the previous record by a WRITE statement

  Craig's NO vote on 000023

    NO:  I agree with Bill Long and Jon Steidel.

  Kurt's NO vote on 000023

    NO:  1. The first question can be read in more than one way, so
      the answer to that question needs to make clearer which way we
      have read it.  (I.e., a _processor_ is not permitted to
      unilaterally terminate the current record under these
      circumstances, but the _program_ is permitted to do so
      explicitly.)

      2. I am not a fan of the wording of the edit.  I would prefer
      something to the effect that the record becomes the last record
      and the data transferred by the write statement becomes the
      last data in the record.  (I.e., I would prefer not to even
      suggest that there might be existing data beyond the current
      point in the record.)

  BillL's NO vote on 000023

    NO:  The answer to the first question, that a new record is not
      started, is correct, but the answer to the second question and
      the corresponding EDIT are not correct.

      Consider the following different, but related, example:

        program write_write
        write (10,"(a,t1,a,a)") "XXXXXXXXX", "ABC", "DEF"
        write (10,"(a,t1,a)",advance='no') "XXXXXXXXX", "ABC"
        write (10,"(a)") "DEF"
        end

      The output from this program is

        ABCDEFXXX
        ABCDEFXXX

      From the description of Position editing (10.6.1) it is clear
      that the output following the tab does not cause the deletion
      of the final XXX characters from the record.  The fact that the
      second output record is created by a non-advancing write
      followed by an advancing write is not operationally different
      from the single advancing write that created the first record.

      The fundamental difference between this example and the question
      considered in the interp is the mechanism by which the current
      location in the record is established prior to the final
      advancing write statement. It would be inconsistent to have one
      case preserve previously existing characters in the record and
      the other case to require the opposite.  To avoid this
      inconsistency, the answer to Question 2 should be Yes. The
      proposed EDIT should be deleted.

000024       Termination of a partial record by a CLOSE, BACKSPACE,
               ENDFILE, or REWIND statement

  Kurt's NO vote on 000024

    NO:  I am unhappy with the edit (but not its intent).  The idea
      of changing the behavior of a WRITE statement that has already
      been executed seems a bit lame.  An additional advancing WRITE
      that transfers no data might be a better descriptive model.

000025       List-directed input: types of variables corresponding to
               repeated values

  Craig's NO vote on 000025

    NO:  I agree with Bill Long and Jon Steidel.

  DickH's NO vote on 000025

    NO:  I don't believe the answer actually answers what I believe
      is the question.  I think the answer to the question is found
      in the first sentence of the answer and should be made clear
      with an example.  I think his question is along the lines of:
      given
        read(*,*) integer_variable, real_variable
      is    2*7  acceptable? or maybe    2*7.0 ?

      I think that is the real question, not how do you determine the
      type of the values.  I agree that the discussion of type
      ambiguity when one of the variables is a character variable is
      interesting and that the supplied edit needs to be made.  But I
      think there should be more discussion of the obvious cases.  I
      would propose changing the first line from
        "No, the variables are not required to be of the same type,
         but the"
      to
        "No, the variables are not required to be of the same type,
         section 10.8, [175:8] states that the effect of the r*c form
         is as if c were repeated r times.  Each effective instance
         of c must meet the form requirements of 10.8.1 corresponding
         to the corresponding input item.

         Note that the" ...

  BillL's NO vote on 000025

    NO:  An input item of

           3*c

      should have the same interpretation as the following sequence

           c c c

      The proposed EDIT would make these two forms different, is
      completely contrary to the common expectation as to how repeat
      factors in input operate, and would cause existing
      implementations to become non-standard.  The current text
      (175:7-8) "The r*c form is equivalent to r successive
      appearances of the constant c, ..."  is correct and does not
      need modification. The definition of constant (R306 23:8) is
      ultimately in terms of graphic characters (21:7). A particular
      sequence of graphic characters (.true., for example) can be
      valid as a value for more than one data type (character and
      logical, for example).

      The flawed part of the answer to the question states "... the
      type of the repeated constant is either a literal constant, or
      a nondelimited character constant, but not both...".  But this
      is not what the standard says. There is no "either" and no "but
      not both" in the standard text, and that text should not be
      there.

      A better answer would be:

        "No, there is no such restriction. The cited Fortran 90
         implementation is non-conforming."

        No EDIT is required.

  Toon's NO vote on 000025

    NO:  Despite the J3 vote in meeting 156, we think that the
      analysis by Bill Long c.s. is correct.

  Rich Maine's e-mail comment on 000025

    On item 25, I distinctly disagreed with Bill Long's
    analysis, but I do think that it points out a flaw in the
    wording that perhaps merits further improvement.  The fields in
    formatted input records are *NOT* constants.  Literal constants
    appear only in source code and, although their syntax is
    similar in many ways to the syntax of formatted I/O fields, it
    is not the same (for example, you can't have kind numbers in
    I/O fields).  We went to a lot of trouble in one of the f90
    interps to get rid of most of the places where I/O fields were
    incorrectly referred to as constants.  Looks like we missed
    one. That omission appears to be what Bill is basing much of
    his answer on.  Probably we ought to fix it and get the word
    "constant" out of this text.  I could actually "buy" either
    answer to this interp, but I don't "buy" an analysis based on
    the inappropriate use of the word "constant".

    On item 25, I do think it was an error.  I can't imagine this
    as an intentional specification - it probably just "fell out"
    of the wording when someone forgot to mention the cases where
    neither "yes" nor "no" make sense.  On the other hand, I don't
    really much care.  Probably the reason that nobody griped
    before is that it only comes up when the user "asks" (with
    inquire) a "stupid" question.  It would be a pretty strange
    program that asked, for example, about pad= for an unformatted
    file and then cared what the answer was.  I can imagine code
    that asks (perhaps because the same INQUIRE statement is used
    for both formatted and unformatted files), but darned if I can
    figure out what constructive use would be made of the answer.

000029       Nested Derived Types and Defined Assignment

  Kurt's NO vote on 000029

    NO:  I agree with the technical intent of this response, but I
      have trouble with the statement "there is no ambiguity or error
      in the standard."  In at least one sense, it may have been an
      error to make the default interpretation of assignment in this
      case intrinsic assignment instead of some kind of implicit
      defined assignment.  It's just that this is not the kind of
      "error" we can fix in a corrigendum.

000081       Definition status of derived-type objects with pointer
               components

  Malcolm's YES comment on 000081

     COMMENT:  The last sentence in the question should say
       "containing" instead of "contains".

       Re Kurt's suggestion that the pointer components should have
       some "defined" association status; they do, it's called
       "undefined pointer association status".  It differs
       significantly from the "undefined definition status" of
       variables in that it is not valid to "assign from" an
       undefined variable, but it is valid to "pointer-assign from"
       an undefined pointer.

       Since we are not allowed to do
         X = Y
       unless Y is defined, and for derived types this consists of
       doing assignment of nonpointers and pointer assignment of
       pointers, we do not want to end up with the silly situation
       where it is ok to do assignment by writing out each component
       by hand but not ok to do it by writing it as a single
       statement.  Thus pointer association status of components ought
       not to have any effect on the definition status of the parent.

  Craig's NO vote on 000081

    NO:  I agree with Dick Hendrickson and Kurt Hirchert.

  DickH's NO vote on 000081

    NO:  I'm really unhappy with the briefness of the answer.
      "No pointer components do not affect the definition status of
       an object. Edits are supplied to clarify this situation."

      Where in the standard does it say that pointer components don't
      affect the definition status?  Why not point the questioner to
      that section?  The edits don't appear to clarify something;
      they appear to change something.  This calls for an actual
      explanation of why things are being changed.  I think
      111:7-8 hints at the answer, but I don't understand the example
      and answer well enough to be sure.

      Maybe it would be clear to me if the answer discussed whether
      or not each assignment statement is standard conforming in
            TYPE t
              REAL,POINTER :: x
            END TYPE
            TYPE(t) var1,var2,var3, var4
            NULLIFY(var1%x)
            var2 = var1
            var3 = var4

  Kurt's NO vote on 000081

    NO:  This is one of two interpretations in this batch where I
      disagree with the proposed technical outcome.  The proposed
      edit moves from giving too much weight to pointer components to
      ignoring them completely.  I believe that for a derived-type
      object to be defined, its pointer components should have a
      defined pointer association status.

  Van's YES comment on 000081

    COMMENT:  I agree with the edits, but the answer seems to be
      either self-contradictory or incomplete.  The question is
        "Should the definition status of an object contain pointer
         components depend on the pointer association status of its
         pointer components and not their definition status?"

      Judging from the edits, the answer should be
        "Neither...."

      Also, shouldn't the "contain" in the question be "containing"?

  John Reid's e-mail comment on 000081

    The sentence in parentheses after the edits should be deleted (it
    is a note to J3).

000085       Public components of private types

  Malcolm's YES comment on 000085

     COMMENT:  I agree with the comment that the title ought to be
       "Public components of inaccessible types".

  Van's YES comment on 000085

    COMMENT:  Neither the question nor the answer appear to have
      anything to do with private types.  SHouldn't the title be
      "... inaccessible types"?

000087       MOD and MODULO intrinsic functions with zero divisor

  Malcolm's YES comment on 000087

    COMMENT:  The protestations that the described semantics of MOD
      are correct would be more convincing if the majority of F77
      compilers actually did this.  With the 6 F77 compilers I have
      easy access to, including a well-known free one and various
      "market leaders", MOD with an integer zero P produces messages
      ranging from a simple "Abort" to "integer divide by zero"; NONE
      (!) of them produce a processor-defined value for MOD with an
      integer zero divisor.  With the half-dozen Fortran 90 compilers
      I have access to, "INTEGER :: X = MOD(1,0)" failed even to
      compile on all but one.  Even if we are talking about
      floating-point MOD at runtime on an IEEE machine, if IEEE traps
      are enabled the program generally dumps core (if traps are not
      enabled, non-conformant output results).  Never mind non-IEEE
      machines.  Prohibiting a zero divisor allows the processor to
      do "clever" things when appropriate on an IEEE machine for
      floating point, while allowing other processors and other
      situations to be handled with an appropriate error message
      (which is what they virtually all do anyway, standard to the
      contrary!)

  DickH's NO vote on 000087

    NO:  This answer is completely wrong.  How can we say the intent
      was "not intended to be standard-conforming"?  Going all the
      way back to FORTRAN 77 the definition for MOD said "undefined
      when the value of the second argument is zero".  F90 replaced
      "undefined" with "processor dependent".  The words are clear,
      there is no "mistake" in the standard.  We may have wished it
      was done differently in the past, but it's been clear for
      almost 40 years.  There's no reason to change it.  Compilers
      are NOT required to compute MOD(A,P) as A-INT(A/P)*P, that's a
      mere suggestion (see the answer to 000012!).  They can evaluate
      it anyway they like and optimize it also.

      This would be a good change to make for F2K.  But it's not an
      error in F95; it's merely a feature we wish were different and
      should be treated like all the other things we are changing to
      make F2k.

  Kurt's YES comment on 000087

    COMMENT:  Does this make Fortran 95 incompatible with Fortran 90
      in a new way?

  Mike's NO vote on 000087

    NO:  none received

  BillL's NO vote on 000087

    NO:  The proposed changes represent a change to the standard that
      is too significant for an interp. Also, the discussion appears
      to be focused on INTEGER arguments, though REAL arguments to
      MOD and MODULO are also supported. Division by zero is
      supported for REAL values on some architectures.  It would seem
      that the current "processor dependent" text would be preferred
      in that case.

  Toon's NO vote on 000087

    NO:  We agree with Dick Hendrickson's and Bill Long (c.s.)'s
      analysis here - in spite of my vote in meeting 156.  There's no
      need to change the F95 Standard in this respect.

000088       INTRINSIC statement and attribute

  Mike's NO vote on 000088

    NO:  none received

  BillL's NO vote on 000088

    NO:  Changing

        "the name shall either appear in an INTRINSIC statement or be
         given the INTRINSIC attribute in a type declaration statement
         in the scoping unit"

      to

        "it shall have been explicitly declared to have the INTRINSIC
         attribute"

      would seem significant enough to warrant an EDIT to the
      standard only if there were mechanisms other than those cited
      in the current text for giving a name the INTRINSIC attribute.
      The answer to the question is correct, but the EDIT seems
      unnecessary.

  John Reid's e-mail comment on 000088

    There is a typo in the last line of the edit.

000090       What do ``Prior Specification'' and ``defined
               previously'' mean?

  Malcolm's YES comment on 000090

    COMMENT:  Much though I appreciate the wish for generous
      semantics and the desire to create more work for  vendors, I
      see no more obvious syntactic item than <entity-decl> to which
      "specification" should refer.   The question itself could go a
      bit further into the spectrum of choices, which I would have
      lined up as
            INTEGER,PARAMETER :: A(xyz1,xyz2) = SIZE(A)
            INTEGER,PARAMETER :: A(xyz1:xyz2,LBOUND(A,1))
            INTEGER,PARAMETER :: A(xyz1:LBOUND(A,1)+10)
      As an implementor, I should certainly view with horror the
      suggestion that I should have to handle enquiries on array
      declarators before I'd finished analyzing them.

  Craig's NO vote on 000090

    NO:  I agree with John Reid, Dick Hendrickson, Bill Long,
               and Jon Steidel.

 DickH's NO vote on 000090

   NO:  The first answer says
     "A prior specification refers to a specification in a previous
      <entity-decl> or in a previous statement.  None of the examples
      are legal."

     This at least needs a reference so we can tell that it means a
     previous <entity-decl>.  I don't see anything in the cited text
     that implies the answer.  In fact, had the phrase "to the left
     of" been included in the answer I would reach a different
     conclusion.

     Surely in
       integer :: P(10) = size(P)
     the "(10)" appears "to the left of" the size function.

     How does the answer apply to
       integer, dimension(10) :: p = size(p)
     or
       integer, dimension(10) :: q, p=size(p)
     or
       dimension p(10)
       integer ::  p = size(p)

     I think consistency and usability require Van's interpretation
     of "to the left of".

     We should at least make John Reid's edits to clarify what the
     (wrong) answer is.

  Mike's NO vote on 000090

    NO:  none received

  Van's NO vote on 000090

    NO:  (1) The utility of a less strict answer to question 1 is
             obvious.
         (2) Several compilers accept the statement in example 1 and
             other subsequent similar ones.  Therefore there appears
             to be no compelling technical reason for the answer to
             be so strict.
         (3) The answer leads to disturbing/amusing anomalies:
               INTEGER, PARAMETER :: P = BIT_SIZE(P)
             is prohibited, but
               INTEGER :: P
               PARAMETER ( P = BIT_SIZE(P) )
             is permitted.

          I have no objection to the answer to question 2.

  BillL's NO vote on 000090

    NO:  The ANSWER text provided is potentially inconsistent with the
      sections on initialization expressions and specification
      expressions.  The edits provided by John Reid resolve those
      issues, and need to be included.

  John Reid's e-mail comment on 000090

    I think an edit is needed. I suggest adding the following at the
    end:

      In the edits, we have taken the opportunity to correct the text
      in the first lines of the referenced paragraphs in 7.1.6.1 and
      7.1.6.2.

      EDITS:

      Page 94, Subclause 7.1.6.1. In the first line of the last
      paragraph of page 94 [94:38], replace 'for a type parameter' by
      'that depends on a type parameter'.

      Page 94, Subclause 7.1.6.1, replace the last sentence of page
      94 [94:40-41] by 'The prior specification may be to the left of
      the inquiry function in the same statement, but shall not be
      within the same <entity-decl>.'

      Page 96, Subclause 7.1.6.2. In the first line of the last
      paragraph of the subclause [96:32], replace 'for a type
      parameter' by 'that depends on a type parameter'.

      Page 96, Subclause 7.1.6.2, replace the second sentence of the
      last paragraph of the subclause [96:34-35] by 'The prior
      specification may be to the left of the inquiry function in the
      same statement, but shall not be within the same
      <entity-decl>.'

000091       Definition of "present" is defective

  Craig's NO vote on 000091

    NO:  I agree with John Reid and Dick Hendrickson.

  DickH's e-mail comment on 00091

    COMMENT:  I agree with John Reid that "in an instance of a
      subprogram" should be retained; it makes it clear that it is a
      property of a specific call (perhaps recursive) to the routine,
      not a general property.

      I also like his attempt at defining absent, but think it's an
      unnecessary change for F95.  Can we do that when we apply the
      edits to F2K?

  Kurt's NO vote on 000091

    NO:  I think the edit is defective.  In the example, I want it to
      be legal to test present(A) in subroutine S11.  I think the
      allowance for host association in the proposed edit is in the
      wrong place to permit this.

  John Reid's e-mail comment on 000091

    I think the edit should define 'absent', used a lot in 13. It
    always easier to understand something expressed as a positive.
    Also, I think the words 'in an instance of a subprogram' should be
    retained.  I suggest:

    [202:43-45] Replace the first sentence of 12.4.1.5 by
      A dummy argument is <<absent>> in an instance of a subprogram if
      it is
        (1) not associated with an actual argument, or
        (2) is associated with an actual argument that is
            (a) a dummy argument that is absent or
            (b) an entity that is host-associated with a dummy
                argument that is absent.
      Otherwise, it is <<present>>.

    The same edit is needed in the glossary:

    In Annex A, page 293, add as the first item:

      <<absent>> (12.4.1.5): A <dummy argument> is <<absent>> in an
        <instance of a subprogram> if it is
        (1) not <associated> with an <actual argument>, or
        (2) is associated with an actual argument that is
            (a) a dummy argument that is <absent> or
            (b) an entity that is host-associated with a dummy
                argument that is <absent>.

    In Annex A, page 299, replace the item for <<present>> by:

      <<present>> (12.4.1.5): A <dummy argument> is <<present>> in an
        <instance of a subprogram> if it is not <absent>.

000092       Values of the PAD= Specifier in the INQUIRE Statement

  Malcolm's NO vote on 000092

     NO:  I disagree that this is an error.  Fortran 90 is
       unambiguous and consistent, and the issue was not revisited
       for Fortran 95.  This would render all existing Fortran 95
       implementations non-conformant 4 years after publication.

  Craig's YES comment on 000092

    COMMENT:  I disagree with those who object because it changes an
      existing standard too much.  My basic philosophy in situations
      like this is that if we find something that is an obvious
      mistake, we should assertively and forthrightly fix the mistake
      at the earliest opportunity.  That opportunity is now.

      We discussed this extensively both in subgroup and in plenary.
      We passed the same fix for Fortran 2000 (F2K), in paper
      01-111r3, even before we started work on Interpretation 92, in
      paper 01-172.  01-111r3 passed unanimously on March 20 and
      01-172 passed unanimously on March 22.  In both cases, there
      was extensive discussion of what should be the proper value of
      the PAD= specifier in an INQUIRE statement if the file or unit
      is not connected or is connected for unformatted I/O.  During
      debate, we came to a consensus that in those cases a value of
      "YES" is misleading.  The votes on both papers were taken with
      everyone having full knowledge of the consequences of approving
      these papers.

      Since this change definitely will be in Fortran 2000, the issue
      is not a matter of whether this change in PAD= will happen but
      when.  If we do not retrofit this change into F95, vendors will
      still be required to make the change in F2K.  Delaying
      implementation until F2K may involve some additional
      complexities.

      Since F2K is a large change to the language, vendors most
      likely will implement the F2K features in a series of compiler
      releases over a period of years.  This process has already
      started in a significant number of F95 compilers.  If this fix
      is delayed until F2K, vendors will need to choose which release
      they make the change in.  How long should they stick with the
      F90 rule and when should they adopt the F2K rule?  Doubless
      different vendors will choose different times, thus creating
      portability problems for application developers.

      Therefore, the simplest and most straightforward approach is to
      make this change in Fortran 95.

  DickH's NO vote on 000092

    NO:  This isn't the time to introduce incompatibilities with F90.

      The standard is perfectly clear about what is going on and what
      the results of inquire with pad= are.  We merely think a bad
      choice was made in the 80's.  The time to fix these things in
      in a new revision of the standard; not as an "interpretation".
      Defer this to F2K when people will expect to find surprises.

  Mike's NO vote on 000092

    NO:  none received

  BillL's NO vote on 000092

    NO:  The proposed change represents a significant improvement and
      should be made in the F2K standard. However, the change
      introduces too great of an incompatibility with the current
      standard to be made through an interp to F95.

000093       Allocatable arrays as actual arguments

  Craig's NO vote on 000093

    NO:  I agree with Dick Hendrickson.

  DickH's YES comment on 000093

    COMMENT:  I prefer a variation of John Reid's edit [80:34]
      Change "; it" to
      ".  It shall not be supplied as an actual argument except to
       certain intrinsic inquiry functions.  It"
       ^^^^^^^

  Kurt's YES comment on 000093

    COMMENT:  The edit needs to be better identified for inclusion in
      a future corrigendum.  It is in item (1) in the list in clause
      6.3.1.2.

  Mike's NO vote on 000093

    NO:  none received

  BillL's NO vote on 000093

    NO:  The program is non-conforming because the argument to the
      SHAPE intrinsic function is not allocated, as is required in
      267:7.  If the dummy argument, X, is neither referenced nor
      defined in the subroutine, it is not clear why the code should
      be illegal.

  John Reid's e-mail comment on 000093

    I do not know what 'as specified' in the edit means. We just need
    to exclude everything other than intrinsic inquiry functions. The
    text in 13 does the further exclusions that are needed, e.g. for
    SHAPE. I suggest:

    [80:34] Change "; it" to
      ".  It shall not be supplied as an actual argument except to
       an intrinsic inquiry function.  It"

    The sentence in parentheses after the edits should be deleted (it
    is a note to J3).
