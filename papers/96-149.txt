Effective Object-Orientation: Discussion Paper

Type Extension
 	- extend types by adding new components
	- base type component layout unchanged in extended type
	- extensible type definitions marked by new keyword CLASS

	Example Syntax:
		CLASS name
			... 0 or more components ...
		END CLASS

		CLASS newname, EXTENDS name
			... 0 or more additional components ...
		END CLASS

	- components in the base class visible in the extended class
	- the type name of the base class visible in the extended class as the aggregate of
	  its members
	- variables of an extensible/extended class declared normally (with the TYPE keyword)

	Example Syntax:
		CLASS POINT
			REAL X,Y,Z
		END CLASS
		CLASS SPACETIME_POINT, EXTENDS POINT
			REAL TIME
		END CLASS
		...
		TYPE(POINT) W
		! W contains only POINT components (W%X, W%Y, W%Z)
		TYPE(SPACETIME_POINT) V
		! V%X is the X coordinate
		! V%POINT is of TYPE(POINT), contains V%X, V%Y, V%Z
		! V%TIME is the TIME coordinate
	Note: W and V are just ordinary variables, there is no additional overhead - they are just
	         like variables of an ordinary derived type.

Polymorphic Variables
	- refer to an object of any type extended from a particular base type (or the type itself)
	- direct access only to components of the base type

	Example Syntax:
		CLASS(POINT) A
		TYPE(POINT) B
		! B is only of TYPE(POINT)
		! A can be of TYPE(POINT) or any type extended from POINT.

		B = A
		! If A happens to be of an extended type (e.g. SPACETIME_POINT) at runtime,
		! this is still ok, with the POINT components being assigned normally.

	- intrinsic function for runtime type enquiry: whether two objects are of exactly the same
	  type (the signature to support this can be generated automatically from the CLASS 		  definitions).  Typically one of the objects will be of a specific TYPE().

	Example Syntax:
		CLASS(POINT) VAR
		TYPE(SPACETIME_POINT) SPT
		... MATCHING_TYPE(VAR,SPT) ... has value .TRUE. iff VAR is a
						    SPACETIME_POINT. 

	- when passed to a TYPE(...) dummy, must either match the dummy's type or be of an
	  extended type, in which case only the TYPE(...) part is effectively passed

	Further Example:
		CLASS(POINT) VAR
		CLASS(SPACETIME_POINT) V2
		INTERFACE
			SUBROUTINE SUB1(A)
				USE POINT_MODULE
				TYPE(POINT) A
			END SUBROUTINE
			SUBROUTINE SUB2(B)
				USE SPACETIME_POINT_MODULE
				TYPE(SPACETIME_POINT) B
			END SUBROUTINE
		END INTERFACE
		...
		CALL SUB1(V2) ! SUB1 expects a TYPE(POINT), so V2%POINT is passed
		CALL SUB2(VAR) ! SUB2 expects a TYPE(SPACETIME_POINT), so it is an
				   ! error if VAR is not a SPACETIME_POINT (or of a type
				   ! extended from SPACETIME_POINT)

	Dummy Arguments
		- assume the type from the actual argument
		- accept the base type or any type extended from it

		Example Syntax:
			SUBROUTINE SUB(A)
				CLASS(POINT) A
				TYPE(SPACETIME_POINT) B
				INTRINSIC MATCHING_TYPE
				IF (MATCHING_TYPE(A,B)) THEN
					PRINT *,"A is a SPACETIME_POINT"
				END IF
			END

	Polymorphic Pointers
		- can point to the base type or any type extended from it
		- ALLOCATE only gives you an object of the base type
		- however, DEALLOCATE operates on any acceptable object
		- allows generic List/Graph/Tree/Stack/etc. code to be written

		Example Syntax:
			CLASS LIST
				CLASS(LIST),POINTER :: NEXT = NULL()
			END CLASS
			...
			INTEGER FUNCTION CARDINAL(L)
				CLASS(LIST) L
				CLASS(LIST),POINTER :: P
				CARDINAL = 1
				P = L%NEXT
				DO WHILE (ASSOCIATED(P))
					P = P%NEXT
					CARDINAL = CARDINAL + 1
				END DO
			END FUNCTION
			...
			CLASS INTLIST, EXTENDS LIST
				INTEGER VALUE
			END CLASS
			CLASS REALLIST, EXTENDS LIST
				REAL VALUE
			END CLASS

	Polymorphic Local Variables
		These can be handled by pointers, but the necessary memory allocation and
		deallocation, although formulaic, is tedious, verbose and error-prone.  Therefore
		allow it to be handled automatically with non-pointer locals.  Note that the CLASS
		notation is effectively marking that these operations are more expensive.

		- begin life undefined
		- assume type on assignment
		- can be passed to a dummy argument when undefined, in which case they
		  become of the dummy's type (but still with undefined components).

		Example Syntax:
			SUBROUTINE SUB
				CLASS(POINT) TMP1,TMP2
				TMP1 = SPACETIME_POINT(1.0,1.0,1.0,0.0)
				!  TMP1 is created as a TYPE(SPACETIME_POINT)
				CALL INITIALISE_HYPERSPACE_POINT(TMP2)
				! TMP2 is created with the type required by INITIALISE_...
			END SUBROUTINE
