Subject: Changes for failed image wording
Date: 2013 June 26

The following changes are intended to make it clear that the failed
image facility provides the processor with a way to indicate failure
that can be tested in a portable program, but does not require a
processor to support failure recovery or specify exactly what the
consequences are following failure.

This paper also reflects a change to make 
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE the lowest priority failure status rather than the
highest priority, and an editorial change from Malcolm.

--------------

[Introduction:iv:p2] After sentence 2 add "The existing system does
not provide a mechanism for a processor to identify what images have
failed during execution of a program. This adversely affects the
resilience of programs executing on large systems."

[Introduction:iv:p3] After the first comma in sentence 1, add "for the
processor to indicate which images have failed during execution and
allow continued execution of the program on the remaining images, "

[5.6 STAT FAILED IMAGE:p11]  This should be replaced by:

"The value of the default integer scalar constant STAT_FAILED_IMAGE is
different from the value of STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE, STAT_LOCKED,
STAT_LOCKED_OTHER_IMAGE, or STAT_UNLOCKED.  If the processor has the
ability to detect that an image of the current team has failed and
does so, the value of STAT_FAILED_IMAGE is assigned to the variable
specified in a STAT=specifier in an execution of an image control
statement, or the STAT argument in an invocation of a collective
procedure.  A failed image is one for which references or definitions
of variables fail when that variable should be accessible, or the
image fails to respond as part of a collective activity. A failed
image remains failed for the remainder of the program execution. If
more than one nonzero status value is valid for the execution of a
statement, the status variable is defined with a value other than
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE. The conditions that cause an image to fail are
processor dependent.

NOTE 5.4 A failed image is usually associated with a hardware failure of
the processor, memory system, or interconnection network.  A failure
that occurs while a coindexed reference or definition, or collective
action, is in progress may leave variables on other images that would be
defined by that action in an undefined state.  Similarly, failure while
using a file may leave that file in an undefined state.  A failure on
one image may cause other images to fail for that reason."


[7.2;p15:22-29] Replace paragraph with:

If the STAT argument is present in an invocation of a collective
subroutine and an error condition occurs, the argument is assigned a
nonzero value and the effect is otherwise the same as that of
executing the SYNC MEMORY statement. If execution involves
synchronization with an image that has stopped, the argument becomes
defined with the value of STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE in the intrinsic module
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV; otherwise, if no image of the current team has
stopped or failed, the argument is assigned a processor-dependent
positive value that is different from the value of STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE
or STAT_FAILED_IMAGE in the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV. If an
image had failed, but no other error condition occurred, the argument
is assigned the value of the constant STAT_FAILED_IMAGE.

[8.5 Edits to clause 8;p27 27-35] replace paragraph wih the following:

If the STAT= specifier appears in a CHANGE TEAM, END TEAM, FORM SUBTEAM, 
LOCK, SYNC ALL, SYNC IMAGES, SYNC MEMORY, or UNLOCK statement and its 
execution is not successful, the specified variable becomes defined with a 
nonzero value and the effect is otherwise the same as that of executing the
SYNC MEMORY statement. If there is a stopped image in the current team, the 
variable becomes defined with the constant STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE in the intrinsic 
module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV (13.8.2); otherwise, if no image of the current team 
has been detected as stopped or failed, the variable becomes defined with a 
processor-dependent positive value that is different from the value of 
STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE or STAT_FAILED_IMAGE in the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV 
(13.8.2). If an image had been detected as failed, the variable becomes 
defined with the the constant STAT_FAILED_IMAGE.

[8.6 Edits to clause 13;p28:22-29] replace paragraph with the following:

If the STAT argument is present in an invocation of a collective
subroutine and an error condition occurs, the argument is assigned a
nonzero value and the effect is otherwise the same as that of
executing the SYNC MEMORY statement. If execution involves
synchronization with an image that has stopped, the argument becomes
defined with the value of STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE in the intrinsic module
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV (13.8.2); otherwise, if no image of the current team
has stopped or failed, the argument is assigned a processor-dependent
positive value that is different from the value of STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE
or STAT_FAILED_IMAGE in the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
(13.8.2). If an image had been detected as failed, but no other error condition
occurred, the argument is assigned the value of the constant
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE.
