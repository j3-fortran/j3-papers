Subject:  Minor defect in definition of "present"

NUMBER: 000091
TITLE: Definition of "present" is defective
KEYWORDS: present, dummy argument
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Subclause 12.4.1.5 begins with a definition of the term "present":

"A dummy argument is present in an instance of a subprogram if it is
associated with an actual argument and the actual argument either is a
dummy argument that is present in the invoking subprogram or is not a
dummy argument of the invoking subprogram."

This seems to be defective in that if the actual argument is a dummy argument
that is accessed by host association, it is not a dummy argument OF the
invoking subprogram, and therefore although it may be "not present" in
the procedure of which it is a dummy argument, it is nonetheless
"present" in an internal procedure of that procedure.

Consider:

  module M
  contains
    subroutine S1 ( A )
      integer, optional :: A
      call S11
    contains
      subroutine S11
        call S12 ( A )
      end subroutine S11
      subroutine S12 ( B )
        integer, optional :: B
        if ( present(B) ) print *, 'B is present'
      end subroutine S12
    end subroutine S1
  end module M

  program P
    use M, only: S1
    call S1
  end program P

Should this print "B is present" as implied by the above analysis?

ANSWER:

No, the program should not print anything.

DISCUSSION:

The lack of consideration of host association in the cited text is
accidental; an edit is supplied to correct this oversight.

EDITS:

[202:43-45] Replace the first sentence of 12.4.1.5 by
"A dummy argument is not <<present>> if it is
 (1) not associated with an actual argument, or
 (2) is associated with an actual argument that is
     (a) a dummy argument that is not present or
     (b) an entity that is host-associated with a dummy argument
         that is not present.
 Otherwise, it is present."
