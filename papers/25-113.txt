Subject: US-02 Make D format edit descriptor obsolescent
Date: 2025-February-05

Proposed edits to implement US-02.

Edits
=====

[295:15+] 13.3.2p1 Edit Descriptors

After the lines for R1307 data-edit-desc, insert a new paragraph p1+

The D data-edit-desc is obsolescent.

[302:23+] 13.7.2.3.3p1+ E and D editing

Insert a new P1+:

The Dw.d edit descriptor is obsolescent.

[598:30+] B.3.1 Obsolescent features - General

Insert a new numbered entry referencing the subclause denoted here
as B.3.yy:

(xx) Dw.d format edit descriptor - see B.3.yy

[600:26+]

Insert new subclause:

B.3.yy Dw.d format edit descriptor

The Dw.d edit descriptor was used for double precision real values
in versions of this standard when there were only two real kinds.
Since Fortran 90, a processor may support more than two real kinds,
and thus a dedicated format edit descriptor for double precision is
no longer useful. Furthermore, as the Dw.d edit descriptor may emit an
E exponent letter instead of D, and has not been enhanced to offer
specification of an exponent width, Dw.d is no longer useful. The
Ew.d and Ew.dEe edit descriptors are usable with all real kinds.
