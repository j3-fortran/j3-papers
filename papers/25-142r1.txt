1 Introduction
==============

At its meeting Feb 19, 2025, J3 decided to approve requirements for
a cpp-like preprocessor for Fortran 202Y (paper 25-114r2).

This is the formal specifications document, revised according to the
discussion arising from 25-114r2.

Terminology: For the purpose of this specification, the "preprocessor"
encompasses all stages of preprocessing of the input text. For
didactic purposes, that might include additional phases of
"preprocessing" that help define the expected priorities of
preprocessing behaviors. (In past discussions, these have included
line continuation processing, comment handling, and tokenization for
the preprocessor.)



2 Lexical specifications
========================


2.1 Lines
---------

li00. The Fortran preprocessor recognizes three distinct types of
      lines: preprocessing directives (and continuation lines
      thereof), Fortran comment lines, and Fortran source fragments.

li11. A line that has a '#' character as the first non-blank character
      of the line is a directive line (as required by C 2023 section
      6.10.1 paragraph 2), except when otherwise specified by the next
      two rules.

li13. In fixed source form, a '#' in column 6 of a non-comment
      line does not introduce a directive line.

li15. A preprocessor directive can be continued with a backslash '\'
      immediately followed by a new-line. The backslash and new-line
      are deleted, the content of the subsequent line is textually
      appended to the current directive, and the subsequent line is
      deleted. This process repeats until the current directive does
      not end with a backslash '\' immediately followed by a new-line.

li17. Preprocessor directive continuation processing described by the
      prior rule is effectively performed before any other processing
      of the text in affected lines.

li19. The maximum length of a preprocessor directive (including
      continuation text) is one million characters.

li21. A source file that ends with a directive line shall neither end
      with a '\', nor a '\' followed immediately by a new-line
      (analogously to C 2023 section 5.1.1.2 bullet 2).

li31. Fortran comment lines are defined as in 25-007 6.3.2.3 and
      6.3.3.2.

li41. Fortran source fragments are those lines that are neither
      preprocessor directive lines (or continuations thereof)
      nor Fortran comment lines.

li43. Text on fixed-form Fortran source fragments is ignored beyond
      column 72.

li45. Fortran source fragments may be continued with a continuation
      ('&' at the end of a free-form line as specified in Fortran 2023
      6.3.2.4, or with a non-blank, non-zero character in column 6 of
      a fixed-form line as specified in Fortran 2023 6.3.3.3).

      Example 1 (free-form):
          call subroutine_foo(1, 2, &
      #ifdef USE_3
                                    3, &
      #else
                                    666, &
      #endif
                                    .true.)

      Example 2 (fixed-form):
            call subroutine_foo(1, 2,
      #ifdef USE_3
           1                       3,
      #else
           1                       666,
      #endif
           2                       .true.)



2.2 Case sensitivity of identifiers
-----------------------------------

cs01. Directive names are case-sensitive and recognized in lower-case.

cs03. Macro names and function-like macro argument names are
      case-sensitive.

cs05. Predefined macro names are case-sensitive.



2.3 Significance of whitespace
------------------------------

ws01. The whitespace characters blank and horizontal tab character may
      appear on directive lines.

ws02. Whitespace may appear before or after the '#' character that
      introduces a directive line.

ws03. Whitespace characters are significant in determining token
      boundaries in preprocessor directive lines.

ws05. Outside of character constants, multiple whitespace characters
      on a directive line are treated as a single space.

ws07. Whitespace characters are significant in determining token
      boundaries for the purposes of recognizing macro names,
      in both fixed-form and free-form Fortran source fragments.

ws09. Whitespace characters are significant in determining token
      boundaries for the purposes of recognizing macro names,
      in both fixed-form and free-form Fortran comment lines.

ws11. In fixed-form input, macro names are not recognized as such when
      spaces are inserted into their invocations.



2.4 Comments
------------

co01. Directive lines may contain C-style '/*' ... '*/' comments.

co05. '/*' ... '*/' comments on directive lines shall extend past a
      new-line only if the line ends in '\' new-line, indicating a
      continuation line.

co07. '/*' ... '*/' comments on directive lines are replaced by a
      single space, as specified in C 2023 section 5.1.1.2 bullet 3.

co08. In a directive line, the '//' token is not interpreted as
      introducing a C-style comment, and neither the '//' token
      nor any subsequent text are removed by the preprocessor.

co09. In a directive line, the '!' character is not interpreted as
      introducing a Fortran-style comment, and neither the '!'
      character nor any subsequent text are removed by the
      preprocessor.

co11. Directive lines (by definition) cannot contain Fortran
      fixed-form 'C' or '*' style comments.



2.5 Token lexicon
-----------------

The preprocessor decomposes the source file into preprocessing tokens
(see C 2023 section 5.1.1.2 Translation phases).

As such, there is a specific lexicon of tokens recognized by the
preprocessor (including unrecognizable tokens).

As in C 2023, these tokens are recognized after any line and comment
handling specified in section 2.1 "Lines" and section 2.4 "Comments"
above.

We use illustrative syntax to describe the directive specifications,
and the translation behavior of the preprocess on Fortran comment
lines and Fortran source fragment lines.

This illustrative syntax makes use of these "tokens".

Further definition of the recognized tokens is deferred to the
upcoming preprocessor syntax paper.


to01. In the definitions of object macros and function-like macros,
      the replacement list may include any arbitrary sequence of
      characters that doesn't include a new-line. Once tokenized,
      this for example may include any tokens allowed in Fortran
      source fragments, those allowed in C integer expressions,
      and any additional tokens recognized by the processor.

to03. Without naming all the tokens explicitly, they appear in the
      illustrative syntax in subsequent sections.


to09. The preprocessor is line-oriented. To define the end of
      a logical line (after continuation handling), the 'EOL' token
      is shown explicitly in the illustrative syntax.

to11. The following tokens also appear in the illustrative syntax
      below.

      |---------------------|---------------------------------------|
      | Token name          |  Characters                           |
      |---------------------|---------------------------------------|
      | ID                  | Regex [A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*          |
      | WHOLE_NUMBER        | Regex [0-9]+                          |
      | CHARACTER_STRING    | Regex "[^"\n]*" where '\n' represents |
      |                     |    new-line.                          |
      | EOL                 | The new-line ending a directive line, |
      |                     |    after continuation processing      |
      |                     |    (see li15).                        |
      |---------------------|---------------------------------------|




3 #-Directives
==============

The following directives are recognized during Fortran preprocessing.
Detailed specifications for each directive appear in the subsections
below.

We use illustrative syntax in the detailed descriptions. Detailed
syntax will appear in a paper to be named later.

Most directives take a sequence of tokens (as defined in section 2.5
"Token lexicon" above). In the detailed descriptions and illustrative
syntax below, we denote these as just "token-list" or
"replacement-list".


di00. The directives listed in di01-di08 are only recognized as such
      if the token immediately following the '#' introducing a
      directive line exactly matches one of the standard directive
      names ('define', 'if', 'pragma', etc.).

di01. The #define object-like macro directive

di02. The #define function-like macro directive

di03. The #undef directive

di04. The #include directive

di05. The #if, #ifdef, #ifndef, #elif, #elifdef,
      #elifndef, #else, #endif conditional directives

di06. The #error and #warning directives

di07. The #line directive

di08. The #pragma directive

di09. The null directive

di10. The processor-dependent directive



3.1 The #define object-like macro directive
-------------------------------------------

See also the rules for expanding object-like macros in
section 4 "Macro identification and expansion" below.

Example syntax:
      #define ID replacement-list EOL



3.1.1 Static semantics specifications
-------------------------------------

do02. The replacement-list is a (possibly empty) sequence of tokens.

do04. The identifier ID must be immediately followed by whitespace
      or EOL.

do06. Whitespace before or after the replacement-list is not
      considered to be part of the replacement-list.



3.1.2 Evaluation semantics specifications
-----------------------------------------

do20. This #define directive defines an object-like macro named by ID
      with a replacement list comprised of the tokens specified in the
      replacement-list.

do22. There is one name space for all macro names.

do24. The #define directive does not scan the replacement-list
      for macros to expand.

do26. An identifier currently defined as an object-like macro shall
      not be redefined by another #define preprocessing directive
      unless the second definition is an object-like macro definition
      and the two replacement lists are identical (as in C 2023).

do28. Two replacement lists are identical if and only if the
      preprocessing tokens in both have the same number, ordering,
      spelling, and white-space separation, where all white-space
      separations are considered identical (as in C 2023).



3.2 The #define function-like macro directive
---------------------------------------------

See also the rules for expanding function-like macros in the
section 4 "Macro identification and expansion" below.

Example syntax:
      #define ID() replacement-list EOL
      #define ID(identifier-list) replacement-list EOL
      #define ID(...) replacement-list EOL
      #define ID(identifier-list, ...) replacement-list EOL



3.2.1 Static semantics specifications
-------------------------------------

df02. The identifier ID must be immediately followed by a
      left parenthesis '(' with no intervening whitespace.

df04. The identifier-list is a comma-separated list of ID tokens.

df06. No identifier may appear more than once in the identifier-list.

df08. The identifier names in the identifier-list define macro
      "parameters" that affect macro expansion of the replacement
      list. (See section 4 "Macro identification and expansion" for
      the semantics of function-like macro expansion.)

df10. The replacement-list may be the empty sequence of tokens.

df12. Whitespace before or after the replacement-list is not
      considered to be part of the replacement-list.

df16. The '...' between the parentheses specifies that the
      function-like macro may be invoked with a variable number of
      arguments. (See section 4 "Macro identification and expansion"
      for the semantics of function-like macros with a variable number
      of arguments.)



3.2.2 Evaluation semantics specifications
-----------------------------------------

df30. This #define directive defines a function-like macro named by ID
      with the specified macro parameters and with a replacement list
      comprised of the tokens specified in the replacement-list.

df32. This #define directive does not scan the replacement-list for
      macros to expand.

df34. An identifier currently defined as a function-like macro shall
      not be redefined by another #define preprocessing directive
      unless the second definition is a function-like macro
      definition, with the same number and spelling of the parameters,
      and the two replacement lists are identical (as in C 2023).



3.3 The #undef directive
------------------------

Example syntax:
      #undef ID EOL



3.3.1 Static semantics specifications
-------------------------------------

ud02. ID shall not be one of the macros defined in section 7
       "Predefined macros" below.

ud04. The specified identifier may or may not have been defined.



3.3.2 Evaluation semantics specifications
-----------------------------------------

ud20. If no definition exists for the identifier ID, this directive
      has no effect.

ud22. The definition for the object-like macro or function-like macro
      named by ID is removed.



3.4 The #include directive
--------------------------

Example syntax:
      #include CHARACTER_STRING EOL
      #include <character-list> EOL
      #include token-list EOL


3.4.1 Static semantics specifications
-------------------------------------

in06. In the second form, the character-list is any sequence of
      processor-dependent characters except EOL and '>'.

in08. In the third form, the token-list does not match the previous
      two forms.


3.4.2 Evaluation semantics specifications
-----------------------------------------

in18. In the third form, the token-list is processed as in Fortran
      source fragments (see section 4 "Macro identification and
      expansion" below). The directive resulting after all
      replacements shall match one of the previous two forms, and
      evaluation proceeds as such.

in20. The preprocessor searches in processor-defined places for the
      file denoted by the CHARACTER_STRING or the character-list.

in22. It is an error if the processor cannot locate the specified
      file.

in24. If the file is located, the processor replaces the #include
      directive line with the contents of that file.

in26. A #include directive may appear in an included file, up to a
      processor-defined nesting limit.

in28. Unlike INCLUDE lines (see Fortran 2023 section 6.4, "Including
      source text"), the #include directive is not prohibited from
      including the same source file at a deeper level of nesting.



3.5 The #if, #ifdef, #ifndef, #elif, #elifdef, #elifndef, #else,
        #endif conditional directives
----------------------------------------------------------------

Example syntax (extra spacing for illustration purposes only):
    General form:
        <if-head>  <if-elif-list>             #endif EOL
        <if-head>  <if-elif-list>  <if-else>  #endif EOL

    Where:
        <if-head> is one of:
            #if token-list EOL  <group>
            #ifdef ID EOL       <group>
            #ifndef ID EOL      <group>

        <if-elif-list> is zero or more of:
            <if-elif>

        <if-elif> is one of:
            #elif     token-list EOL  <group>
            #elifdef  ID EOL          <group>
            #elifndef ID EOL          <group>

        <if-else> is one of:
            #else EOL  <group>

        <group> is zero or more of:
            directive lines
            Fortran comment lines
            Fortran source fragment lines


3.5.1 Static semantics specifications
-------------------------------------

if05. An <if-head> is comprised of a #if, #ifdef, or #ifndef directive
      and signals the start of a "chain" of conditional directives.

if15. A series of #elif, #elifdef, and #elifndef directives, and the
      #else directive (if present) are part of the same chain of
      directives introduced by the nearest preceding <if-head>.

if20. A chain of conditional directives ends with the #endif
      directive.

if25. Within a conditional directive chain, a #if, #ifdef, or #ifndef
      directive introduces a new chain of conditional directives, at a
      new nesting level, within the enclosing conditional directive
      chain.

if30. The conditional directive chains must properly nest, with each
      nested chain appearing entirely within a single <group> of the
      enclosing chain.



3.5.2 Evaluation semantics specifications
-----------------------------------------


ix05. The #ifdef and #ifndef directives are evaluated as if they had
      been written '#if defined(ID)' and '#if !defined(ID)'
      respectively. (For brevity, the descriptions of #ifdef and
      #ifndef directives below are omitted, and assume this
      transformation.)

ix10. The #elifdef and #elifndef directives are evaluated as if they
      had been written '#elif defined(ID)' and '#elif !defined(ID)'
      respectively. (For brevity, the descriptions below assume this
      transformation has been made).

ix12. In the descriptions below, constructs may be "skipped".
      When skipped:

        - Conditional directives within the construct are recognized
          only to maintain proper nesting of conditional directives.
        - No nested directives in the construct are processed.
        - No macro expansion takes place in directive lines, Fortran
          comment lines or Fortran source fragment lines in the
          construct.
        - No skipped lines of any kind in the construct are made
          available to subsequent processing by the processor.

ix14. In the descriptions below, <group> constructs that are not
      skipped participate in further preprocessing and processing.
      When participating:

        - Macros are expanded in Fortran comment lines and source
          lines.
        - Nested directives in the <group> are processed.
        - The resulting Fortran comment lines and Fortran source
          fragment lines are made available for subsequent processing
          by the processor.

ix15. Before evaluating the token-lists in any <if-head> and <if-elif>
      constructs that are not skipped, macros in the token-lists are
      processed as described in section 4 "Macro identification and
      expansion".

ix20. After expansion, the resulting token list in <if-head> and
      <if-elif> constructs that are not skipped must comprise
      a valid integer expression as described in section 5
      "Expressions allowed in #if and #elif directives" static
      semantics. This expression is called the "controlling
      expression" for the directive.

ix25. The values of controlling expressions in <if-head> and <if-elif>
      constructs are evaluated according to the evaluation semantics
      described in section 5 "Expressions allowed in #if and #elif
      directives".

ix30. If the controlling expression in an <if-head> evaluates to a
      nonzero value, then the <group> contained within that <if-head>
      construct participates in further preprocessing, as described
      above. Subsequent <if-elif> and <if-else> constructs in the same
      chain are skipped.

ix45. If the controlling expression in an <if-head> construct
      evaluates to a zero value, then the <group> contained within
      that <if-head> construct is skipped. Preprocessing continues
      with any <if-elif> constructs in the same chain, as described
      below.

ix50. When the controlling expression in an <if-head> construct
      evaluates to zero, the controlling expressions in each <if-elif>
      construct in the same chain are evaluated in turn, until one
      evaluates to a non-zero value. Those <group>s whose controlling
      expression evaluates to zero are skipped.

ix55. When the controlling expression in an <if-elif> construct
      evaluates to a nonzero value, the <group> contained within that
      <if-elif> construct continues to participate in preprocessing.
      Subsequent <if-elif> constructs and any remaining <if-else>
      constructs in the same chain are skipped.

ix60. When all controlling expressions in the <if-head> construct and
      <if-elif> constructs evaluate to a zero value and an <if-else>
      construct is present in the same chain, the <group> contained in
      the <if-else> construct continues to participate in
      preprocessing.

ix65. When all controlling expressions in the <if-head> construct and
      all <if-elif> constructs evaluate to a zero value and no
      <if-else> construct is present in the same chain, then all
      <group>s in these constructs are skipped.



3.6 The #error and #warning directives
--------------------------------------

Example syntax:
        #error token-list EOL
        #warning token-list EOL

The #error and #warning directives are used to announce user-defined
error conditions in the input.


3.6.1 Static semantics specifications
-------------------------------------


3.6.2 Evaluation semantics specifications
-----------------------------------------

ew02. The token-list is not expanded.

ew04. The processor produces a diagnostic message that includes
      the token-list.

ew06. The processor shall reject a submitted program if the processor
      encounters a #error directive during preprocessing.

ew10. Additional behavior is processor-dependent.



3.7 The #line directive
-----------------------

Example syntax:
        #line WHOLE_NUMBER EOL
        #line WHOLE_NUMBER CHARACTER_STRING EOL


3.7.1 Static semantics specifications
-------------------------------------

li02. The WHOLE_NUMBER shall not be zero.

li04. The WHOLE_NUMBER shall not exceed 2147483647.


3.7.2 Evaluation semantics specifications
-----------------------------------------

li20. In both forms, the #line directive causes the processor
      to behave as if the following sequence of lines begins with a
      presumed line number specified by the WHOLE_NUMBER.

li24. In the second form, the #line directive causes the processor
      to change the presumed file name of the source file to be the
      contents of the CHARACTER_STRING.



3.8 The #pragma directive
-------------------------

Example syntax:
        #pragma token-list EOL


3.8.1 Static semantics specifications
-------------------------------------

pr02. The token-list may not be empty.

pr10. The token-list shall not begin with the identifier 'STDF',
      either before or after macro expansion.


3.8.2 Evaluation semantics specifications
-----------------------------------------

pr20. The semantics of the token-list are processor-dependent.
      In particular, it is processor-dependent whether macro
      expansion is performed on the token-list.

pr22. The #pragma directive causes the processor to behave in a
      processor-defined manner.

pr24. Any #pragma that is not recognized by the processor is ignored.



3.9 The null directive
----------------------

Example syntax:
        # EOL


3.9.1 Static semantics specifications
-------------------------------------

nu02. The only tokens allowed on a null directive are the '#' and
      the end-of-line indicator EOL.


3.9.2 Evaluation semantics specifications
-----------------------------------------

nu10. The null directive has no effect.



3.10 The processor-dependent directive
--------------------------------------

Example syntax:
        # token-list EOL


3.10.1 Static semantics specifications
--------------------------------------

nd02. The token-list in a processor-dependent directive may not begin
      with any of the directive names appearing in the syntax above
      ('define', 'undef', 'include', etc.).


3.10.2 Evaluation semantics specifications
------------------------------------------

nd20. The result of evaluating a processor-dependent directive is
      processor-dependent.




4 Macro identification and expansion
====================================

NOTE: This section is currently incomplete. A self-contained
specification for macro identification and expansion will appear in a
forthcoming paper.


4.1 Comparison to macro identification and expansion in CPP
-----------------------------------------------------------

We intend for macro identification and expansion to operate almost
exactly as specified in C 2023 section 6.10.5, however it will differ
in minor ways to accommodate Fortran syntax. The following exceptions
have consensus amongst the authors:

me10. When determining argument boundaries in the invocation of a
      function-like macro, FPP ignores commas surrounded by matching
      sets of '[  ]' or '(/  /)' brackets, in addition to matching
      sets of '(  )' parentheses (as specified in C 2023 section
      6.10.5-11).

Additional details are still under discussion and will be outlined in
a future paper.


4.2 The identifiers __VA_ARGS__ and __VA_OPT__
----------------------------------------------

As specified in C 2023 section 6.10.5.1, see also section 4.1
above.


4.9 The '#' and '##' operators
------------------------------

As specified in C 2023 section 6.10.5.{2,3}, see also section 4.1
above.




5 Expressions allowed in #if and #elif directives
=================================================


ex05. When evaluating a #if or #elif directive, first every instance
      of the 'defined ID' or 'defined(ID)' operator is evaluated and
      replaced with the resulting WHOLE_NUMBER. A 'defined' expression
      evaluates to 1 if the identifier is currently defined as a macro
      name (that is, if it is predefined or if it has been the subject
      of a #define preprocessing directive without an intervening
      #undef directive with the same subject identifier), 0 if it is
      not.

ex10. When evaluating a #if or #elif directive and after 'defined'
      processing described in ex05, the token-list is then subjected
      to macro expansion and replacement (see section 4 "Macro
      identification and expansion"). This results in a token-list of
      the expression to be evaluated.

ex12. Since expression evaluation occurs *after* macro expansion,
      there will be no object-like macro or function-like macro
      invocations left to expand. All remaining IDs are replaced with
      the WHOLE_NUMBER 0.

ex15. The resulting list of tokens shall be a valid expression
      comprised of WHOLE_NUMBERs and operators as described
      below.

ex17. Preprocessing computes the integer value of conditional
      expressions using the greatest integer range available to the
      processor to determine the truth or falsity of the controlling
      expression.

ex20. The processor shall reject a program if evaluation of the
      expression generates a computational error (such as divide by
      zero).

ex25. When the expression evaluates to zero, the controlling
      expression will be considered "false". If the expression
      evaluates to any non-zero value, the controlling expression will
      be considered "true".


5.1 Operators allowed in controlling expressions
------------------------------------------------

op01. To maintain compatibility with the use of C preprocessing
      directives in many existing Fortran programs, the operators
      allowed in controlling expressions in #if and #elif expressions
      are a subset of those defined in C 2023 section 6.5
      "Expressions" and section 6.6 "Constant expressions".

op03. A "precedence level" is assigned to each operator that
      determines how the operators combine with sub-expressions
      containing other operators at different precedence levels.

op05. An "associativity" is assigned to each operator that determines
      how operators at the same precedence level are combined. "left"
      means the operator binds to the left, "right" means the operator
      binds to the right.

op07. The following table describes the semantics of the allowed
      operators in conditional expressions. The table is grouped by
      precedence level, from lowest precedence to highest.

      We label subexpressions "e1", "e2", and "e3" to aid in
      describing the evaluation semantics. Unless otherwise specified,
      all operators evaluate with the same semantics as their Fortran
      counterparts.

op12. The logical OR operator guarantees left-to-right evaluation; if
      the first operand evaluates to non-zero, the second operand is
      not evaluated and the resulting value is 1. Otherwise, the
      second operand is evaluated, and if that evaluation yields 0 the
      resulting value is 0, otherwise the resulting value is 1.

op13. The logical AND operator guarantees left-to-right evaluation; if
      the first operand evaluates to 0, the second operand is not
      evaluated and the resulting value is 0. Otherwise, the second
      operand is evaluated, and if that evaluation yields 0 the
      resulting value is 0, otherwise the resulting value is 1.

op14. The conditional expression 'e1 ? e2 : e3' guarantees left-to-right
      evaluation; if the first operand e1 evaluates to non-zero,
      then the third operand e3 is not evaluated and the resulting value
      is the value of evaluating the second operand e2. Otherwise,
      the second operand e2 is not evaluated and the resulting value
      is the value of evaluating the third operand e3.



7 Predefined macros
===================

pm00. Macro names beginning with a leading underscore followed by an
      uppercase letter or a second underscore are reserved to the
      processor. Reserved names shall not be the subject of a #define
      or #undef preprocessing directive within a program unit. [Note:
      Any macro name matching the regular expression
      '/^_[A-Z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*$/' is considered reserved.]

pm01. Any macro name predefined by the processor shall begin with a
      leading underscore followed by an uppercase letter or a second
      underscore.

pm02. The processor shall not predefine the macro '__cplusplus',
      nor any macro whose name starts with '__STDC'.

pm03. Unless listed in the following subclauses, the processor shall
      not predefine any macro whose name starts with '__STDF' or
      '__stdf'.

pm10. The values of the predefined macros listed in the following
      subclauses (except for '__FILE__' and '__LINE__') remain
      constant throughout the program unit.

pm12. The identifier 'defined' shall not be the subject of a #define
      or a #undef preprocessing directive.

pm15. The presumed source file name and line number can be changed by
      the #line directive.

The following macro names shall be defined by the processor:


7.1 __LINE__
------------

pm20. '__LINE__' shall be predefined to a WHOLE_NUMBER representing
      the presumed line number (within the current source file)
      of the current line.


7.2 __FILE__
------------

pm30. '__FILE__' shall be predefined to a CHARACTER_STRING
      representing the presumed name of the current source file


7.3 __DATE__
------------

pm40. '__DATE__' shall be predefined to a CHARACTER_STRING
      representing the date of translation of the preprocessing
      program unit

pm41. '__DATE__' shall be a character literal constant of the form
      "Mmm dd yyyy", where the names of the months are the same as
      those specified in C 2023 for the asctime function, and the
      first character of "dd" is a space character if the value is
      less than 10.

pm42. If the date of translation is not available, a
      processor-dependent valid date shall be supplied.


7.4 __TIME__
------------

pm50. '__TIME__' shall be predefined to a CHARACTER_STRING
      representing the time of translation of the preprocessing
      program unit.

pm51. '__TIME__' shall be a character literal constant of the form
      "hh:mm:ss", where "hh" is the hour of the day, "mm" is the
      minutes of the hour, and "ss" is the seconds of the minute.

pm52. If the time of translation is not available, a
      processor-dependent valid time shall be supplied.


7.5 __STDF__
------------

'__STDF__' is an analog to '__STDC__' in C and '__cplusplus' in C++.
Its primary role is to provide preprocessor-visible and
vendor-independent identification of the underlying target language
(i.e., "the processor is Fortran"), which enables one to write
multi-language header files with conditional compilation based on
language.

pm61. '__STDF__' shall be predefined to the WHOLE_NUMBER 1




8 INCLUDE line processing
=========================

ic01. After macro expansion takes place on a given Fortran source
      fragment, it may contain a Fortran 'INCLUDE' line. 'INCLUDE'
      line replacement occurs during preprocessing and is handled
      analogously to '#include' directives (as specified in section 3.4
      "The #include directive").

ic03. The source text included via an 'INCLUDE' line is subject to
      preprocessing. After the INCLUDE line is replaced with the
      source text of the included file, preprocessing continues at
      the first line of the replacement text.

ic07. An 'INCLUDE' line can be generated by macro expansion (unlike
      '#include' directives).

ic10. Included text may contain any source text, including additional
      'INCLUDE' lines.

ic11. An 'INCLUDE' line is permitted to directly or indirectly result
      in the inclusion of the same source text.

ic12. The maximum depth of nesting of any nested INCLUDE lines
      is processor-dependent (analogously to in26).




9 Translation limits
====================

To enhance portability of source translated by the Fortran preprocessor,
the standard shall specify minimum translation limits for conforming
processors, governing various aspects of preprocessing source text.
Program units exceeding the specified limits might not be acceptable to
all processors.

Specific minimum values for the limits will be the subject of a future
paper, but are expected to include at least the number of:

- Nesting levels of conditional inclusion
- Characters in a macro name
- Macro identifiers simultaneously defined in one program unit
- Characters in a string literal
- Parameters in one macro definition
- Arguments in one macro invocation
- Nesting levels for #include files




Appendix A: Divergences from C
==============================

In many ways, the FPP specified by this document adheres to the
existing practice established by the C preprocessor over the past
several decades. However FPP semantics also deliberately diverge from
the analogous behavior of the C preprocessor as specified in C 2023.
This non-normative section enumerates such deliberate differences,
as a reference for readers to assist in comparisons.

General differences include:

dfc10. FPP does not recognize '//'-style comments on directive lines.

dfc20. FPP omits the #embed directive added in C 2023.

dfc30. FPP omits (and forbids) many predefined macros whose names
       begin with '__STDC'.

dfc40. FPP expands macro invocations inside Fortran comments on
       Fortran source fragment lines and in Fortran comment lines.

dfc60. The token-list in the FPP #pragma directive may not be empty.

Differences in the conditional expression grammar for #if and #elif
directives include:

dfc80. FPP omits the comma operator.

dfc82. FPP omits character literal constants.

dfc84. FPP omits the 'true' and 'false' boolean literals added in
       C 2023.

dfc86. FPP omits the '__has_include' expression added in C 2023.

dfc88. FPP omits the '__has_c_attribute' expression added in C 2023.

dfc90. FPP omits the '__has_embed' expression added in C 2023.

Differences in macro identification and expansion are currently
documented explicitly in section 4.1.
