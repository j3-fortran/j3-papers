Subject:    BIND(C) for internal procedures
References: J3/06-143, Resubmit of J3/06-160

Note: I am not certain to what J3/06-160 was discussed already at
meeting 176, however, I consider it integration material and am
resubmitting it again for consideration by Interop.

Discussion:
__________

Recently we allowed internal procedures to be passed as actual
arguments or to be the targets of procedure pointers. Integration
demands that this be extended to work with C Interop, that is, a
<proc-language-binding-spec> should be allowed for internal
procedures, and also such procedures should be allowed as actual
arguments to C_FUNLOC.

We should not allow binding labels for internal procedures since
the host environment of the internal procedure (required in order
to execute it) is not established until runtime (and thus not known
to the linker). There are two options for achieving this:
1) Require that BIND(C,NAME="") be specified, i.e., no binding label
be requested explicitly, or
2) Do not allow a NAME= specifier and explain that there is no
binding label for internal procedures.
I give the edits here for both options. I vote for option 1 myself,
since I would like to have the "no NAME= specifier" constraint apply
only to INTERFACE blocks, and not to real procedures. This is similar
to how we require NAME="" to be specified for PRIVATE module procedures,
instead of saying they have no binding label.

Edits:
__________

Note that no edits are needed for C_FUNLOC: Once we allow internal
procedures to be interoperable, they can be actual arguments to
C_FUNLOC.

Option 1:

[279:30] Replace constraint C1237 (R1225) with
C1237 (R1225) If a <proc-language-binding-spec> is specified for an
internal procedure, the NAME= specifier shall appear and it shall
specify that the procedure has no binding label (15.4.1).

Option 2:

[279:30] Delete constraint C1237 (R1225)

[279:27] In the constraint C1236 (R1225) replace "of an interface
body" with "of an internal procedure or of an interface body"

[403:36] Replace:
"the procedure is not a dummy procedure or procedure pointer" with
"the procedure is not a dummy procedure, an internal procedure, or
a procedure pointer"
