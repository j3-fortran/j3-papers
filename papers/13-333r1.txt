Discussion
----------

A ballot comment proposes a new intrinsic, THIS_TEAM ( ). The
following is extracted from N1989.

---
{Tobias 1}: N1983 permits at some places the use of a team variable,
which refers to the ancestor team. In particular in image selectors:
"[team-variable :: cosubscript-list]".

The PDTS requires that the team-variable was assigned a value by a
FORM SUBTEAM statement. However, that makes it rather complicated to
access the initial team (which encompasses all images). [Or the
current subteam, in case that the caller has already done some
partition before calling a procedure (in a library), which creates
further subteams.] Hence, I think it would be useful to have an
intrinsic procedure, which sets the value of the current team to a
team-variable.  assuming For instance, "subroutine
this_team(team-variable)". One could add an optional "distance"
argument but as the caller has to be aware (for practical use) of the
image indexes, it is probably not needed.

One usage case would be a partition in a climate model into air, land
and sea (cf. Annex A.1) where one exchanges every few iterations
information for the boundaries between different subteams. This could
be done in the "air" subteam via "boundary[parent_team ::
sea_neighbor] = values; event post(data_is_there[parent_team ::
sea_neighbor])".  Without the new subroutine, one had either leave the
subteam, exchange the boundaries, and re-enter. (Implies two global
synchronizations for end change team/change team for each exchange.)
Or one had to form an artificial subteam, which encompasses all of the
images of the (current, initial) team. The effect of the latter would
be similar to the proposed "this_team()" except that it is uglier and
requires three pointless synchronization (form subteam, change team,
end change team) - but at least not during the iteration.
---

{Ed}: An additional use case involves the need to access the parent
team variable in an image selector in a subprogram where the name
originally given to the parent team is not known.  A local name for
the same team can be constructed and used.

THIS_TEAM would be a more efficient alternative to constructing a name
for the initial team.

If accepted, this feature would require a new subclause 7.4.14+,
modification to C501 to allow a new context for defining a variable of
TEAM_TYPE, and modifications to [10:13] to allow a variable defined by
THIS_TEAM to be used in a CHANGE TEAM construct.

Response: (TBD) This is a new feature that will require a committee
vote.


Edits to N1983:
--------------

[22:40] {Tobias 1} Add section

7.4.15 THIS_TEAM ( TEAM_VAR [,DISTANCE] )

Description: Populate TEAM_VAR with team value

Class:  Subroutine

Arguments:

TEAM_VAR   shall be scalar and of type TEAM_TYPE defined in the
           ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module.  It is an INTENT(OUT)
           argument.  The corresponding actual argument shall not be
           the team variable of the current team, nor of any of its
           ancestors.

DISTANCE (optional) shall be scalar nonnegative integer.  It is an
           INTENT(IN) argument.

If DISTANCE is not present, TEAM_VAR is defined with the value of a
team variable representing the current team. If DISTANCE is present
with a value less than or equal to the team distance between the
current team and the initial team, TEAM_VAR is defined with the value
of a team variable representing the ancestor team at that
distance. Otherwise TEAM_VAR is defined with the value of a team
variable representing the initial team.


Examples:

   USE,INTRINSIC :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
   TYPE(TEAM_TYPE) :: WORLD_TEAM, TEAM2

   ! Declare a variable representing the initial team
   CALL THIS_TEAM(WORLD_TEAM)
   END

   SUBROUTINE TT (A)
   USE,INTRINSIC :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
   TYPE(TEAM_TYPE) :: PARENT_TEAM
   REAL A[*]

   CALL THIS_TEAM(PARENT_TEAM, 1)

   ! Reference image 1 in parent's team
   A [PARENT_TEAM :: 1] = 4.2

   ! Reference image 1 in my team
   A [1] = 9.0

   RETURN
   END



[9:22-25] {Ed: modification to C501 to allow new context} Replace C501
with:

"C501 A team variable shall not appear in a variable definition
      context except as the team-variable in a FORM TEAM statement, as
      an allocate-object in an ALLOCATE statement without a
      SOURCE=alloc-opt, as an actual argument to a THIS_TEAM call, or
      as an actual argument in a reference to a procedure with an
      explicit interface where the corresponding dummy argument has
      INTENT(INOUT)."

[10:13] {Ed: modifications to allow a variable defined by THIS_TEAM to
          be used in a CHANGE TEAM construct} Change sentence at
          [10:13] to read: "The value of the team-variable shall have
          been formed by executing a FORM TEAM statement or a call to
          THIS_TEAM()."

[10:30-32] {Add THIS_TEAM as valid way to set a <team-variable>}
     Change sentence at lines 30-32 to read: "If <team-variable>
     appears, its value shall be the same as that of a team variable
     that was assigned a value by a FORM TEAM statement for the
     current team or an ancestor of the current team, or a call to
     THIS_TEAM, and the cosubscripts are interpreted as if the current
     team were the team specified by <team-variable>."

[30:13+] {Add THIS_TEAM to intrinsic procedures} Insert a line
following description of TEAM_DEPTH() to say

"THIS_TEAM( TEAM_VAR [, DISTANCE] )  S    Populate TEAM_VAR team value"
