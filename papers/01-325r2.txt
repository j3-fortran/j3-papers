Section and page/line numbers are from 01-007R2

1) The restriction in [362:1-3] is too severe.  An interface for a
generic procedure requires an explicit interface for each of the
specific procedures that can be referenced through the generic
name. It is important to allow the specific procedures to be written
in C. Generic interfaces to MPI routines are significant examples.
The current wording in [362:1-3] does not allow BIND(C) for a
procedure which would otherwise require an explicit interface,
including the requirement of the explicit interface to be part of a
generic interface. Similarly, the use of the VALUE attribute on dummy
arguments is not allowed. We believe this was not intended.

Text already exists that prohibit allocatable, pointer, or optional
dummy arguments in combination with BIND(C) [65:17-18], and the
combination of the ELEMENTAL prefix with BIND(C) [259:7-8].
Additional constraints are supplied in the section specifying
subprogram definition to replace the text [363:1-3].

[258:25+] C1239.1 (R1224) A <proc-language-binding-spec> shall not be
specified if the function result is array valued, a
pointer, or allocatable.

[258:43+] C1241.1 (R1224) A <proc-language-binding-spec> shall not be
specified if any dummy argument is an assumed shape array,
polymorphic, or of a derived type that has type parameters.

[261:4+] C1249.1 (R1231) A  <proc-language-binding-spec> shall not be
specified if any dummy argument is an assumed shape array,
polymorphic, of a derived type that has type parameters,
or asterisk.

2) In Note 15.19, the print statement in [362:31] outputs the whole
DIGIT_ARR, including element 10. The most likely assumption about how
the (missing) COPY routine works would result in DIGIT_ARR(10) having
the value of the C null character.  This character should not be
included as part of the characters printed.

Edit:

[362:31] Replace "DIGIT_ARR" with "DIGIT_ARR(1:9)"
