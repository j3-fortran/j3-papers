1   Edits
394:6-7 [At [63:2], we see that an enumeration is a type alias, and
an enumerator is a named constant.  The list at [394:4-7] has named
constants, type aliases and enumerations, but not enumerators.  For
consistency, either enumerators need to be in the list, or
enumerations don't need to be.  Choose the latter for simplicity.
Editor: Delete "enumerations,".]

394:23, 27  [It's unlikely that one name is used to identify
another.  Editor: Delete "the name of" twice.]

395:5       [It's unlikely that one name is used to identify
another.  Editor: Delete "the name of".]

396:bottom  [Editor: Delete Note 16.7.  It's said better at
[334:31-34].

397:2,5,8   ["A ... has the scope of a derived-type definition."
Which derived-type definition?  Editor: "of a" => "of its" thrice.]

397:5       [Editor: Delete the first "derived".]

397:23  [I don't think that scoping units make references.
            Editor: "making" => "in which the"; insert "occurs"
            after the first "procedure".]

397:25+ [We never say that the entities discussed in this subclause
are construct entities -- we just define their scopes.  We make a
list of local entities at the beginning of 16.2, so it seems
reasonable to make a list of construct entities here.  This also
says they're variables.]

    "Variables that appear as DO variables of implied-DOs in DATA
    statements or array constructors, as dummy arguments in
    statement function statements, or as index-names in FORALL
    statements are statement entities.  Variables that appear as
    index-names in FORALL constructs or associate-names in SELECT
    TYPE or ASSOCIATE constructs are construct entities."

397:33[Editor: "index-name" => "index-name".]

398:11-12   [Implies that a FORALL construct has only one index-
name.  Editor:  "the index-name" => "any of its index-names"; "a
nested ... index-name" => "an index-name of a FORALL statement or
FORALL construct shall not be the same as an index-name of a
containing FORALL construct".]

Do NOT do this edit.  Reason:  Not needed.
399:12  [It isn't clear that entities not named in IMPORT
statements are not accessible by host association.  Editor: Insert
", and only to those entities" after "body".]

Do NOT make this edit.  Reason: The procedure name declared by the
interface body is a global name.
399:18  [An interface body is a local entity.  Editor: ",
procedure-declaration-stmt, or interface-body" => "or procedure-
declaration-stmt".]

Do NOT make this edit.  Reasons: We like the list as it is.  An
interface body does not have a name and this passage deals with
named objects.
399:20-400:2    [Local entities are already listed at [394:3-10].
We don't need to list them again.  Editor:  "A name ... nongeneric
name" => "Any entity of the host that has the same nongeneric name
as a local entity".  If we don't remove the list, at least make it
consistent with [394:3-10] by adding "an interface-body" somewhere.
Then, put the list in the same order as at [394:3-10] so it's
easier to verify we're not committing the error Dick Weaver
observed:  "Say it twice, say it wrong at least once."]

Do NOT make this edit.  Reason: We like the note as it is.
400:8+1-3   [The essence of Note 16.10 is on the previous page,
and, with the edit for [399:12], almost verbatim.  Editor: Delete
Note 16.10.]

Do NOT make this edit.  Reason: The existing text makes it clear
when an EXTERNAL statement or a TYPE statement with the EXTERNAL
attribute is required in the host scoping unit.
400:9       [If an external or dummy procedure has an explicit
interface, it thereby has the EXTERNAL attribute, so "with an
implicit interface" is redundant.  Editor: Delete it.]

400:13,16   [Which scoping unit is "that" scoping unit?  It could
be the inner one, a host scoping unit, or a module.  Editor:  "that
scoping unit" => "the scoping unit from which it is accessed"
twice.]

2   Is this a spec change, a stealth interp, or just clean-up?
The following edits, if implemented, would specify that the
appearance of a name as the dummy argument of a statement function
does not constitute an implicit declaration of a variable in the
scoping unit that contains it.  Is this a spec change, a stealth
interp, or just clean-up?

Do NOT do any of the following edits.  JoR believes that the
existing text in 02-007r2 is fine just the way it is and no changes
are needed.

397:30-32   [Now that we have defined "statement entity" and
"construct entity" we can simplify the part about it not being an
implicit declaration of a variable in the scoping unit that
contains its statement or construct (and also specify it for
statement function dummy arguments at the same time).  Editor:
Delete.]

397:36-38   [Editor: Delete "The appearance ... construct."]

397:41+ Same ¶  The appearance of a name as the name of a
statement or construct entity is not an implicit declaration of a
variable of that name whose scope is the scoping unit that contains
its statement or construct.  A statement or construct entity is not
accessible outside of its statement or construct.

3   Not sure what to do
Do nothing with any of the issues in this section.
 [394:4] refers to "Named variables that are not statement or
 construct entities."  I can't find where statement and construct
 entities are defined to be variables.  So "named variables that
 are not statement or construct entities" appears to be just "named
 variables".  That's probably wrong, so we should perhaps say
 somewhere that statement and construct entities are variables.

[394:19-395:6] doesn't make sense. [394:19-20] claims to be about
the names of local entities.  Then the next three items introduced
by that sentence are about procedure names within their
subprograms.  A name for an external procedure isn't a local name
within its subprogram, but the parenthetic remark says that one
usage of the procedure name is allowed only for module or internal
procedures, implying that the other case, an external procedure, is
a local entity.

If a procedure is recursively referenced from within itself, does
the procedure name identify that reference?

The parts about common blocks appear to be adequately covered by
16.2.1.

The "except" part of the intro to these items doesn't make sense:
The appearance of a procedure name within that procedure isn't "in
another scoping unit."

If items (1) – (3) actually do make sense, we need to say something
about referring to the procedure name to get the interface for a
procedure pointer or deferred type-bound procedure declared within
the subprogram.  These items appear to prohibit such usages.
