  This paper presents a collection of miscellaneous fixes to the current draft of Fortran 2000.

Edits.
  Edits are with respect to the 00-007r2.
          [401:5+]  Add to the glossary:
effective item (9.5.2):  A scalar object that results when a data transfer statement's list items are expanded
according to the rules in 9.5.2 for handling array and derived-type list items.

          [402:10+] Add to the glossary:
                                generic interface (12.3.2.1):   an interface specified by a generic interface block.
generic interface block (12.3.2.1):  an interface block with a generic specification.

          [405:22+] Add to the glossary:
pure procedure (12.6):   a procedure which is a pure intrinsic function or subroutine (13.1, 13.12), or is defined
by a pure subprogram, or a statement function that references only pure functions.  A pure procedure has
additional constraints specified in 12.6.  

          [274:37]  Make "pure procedure" bold.

  Addressing an issue from 00-261:
            [183:8-12]  Delete "A derived-type . . . representation.".

  Addressing an issue from 00-240r1:
          [343:10]  Replace "Unambiguous" with "Determining unambiguous".

                                     [367:19+] Insert "  IEEE_IS_NEGATIVE Determine if value is negative".

                         [361:38]  Replace with   "USE, INTRINSIC :: IEEE_ARITHMETIC;
                                  USE, INTRINSIC :: IEEE_FEATURES" on one line in bold.

            [242:6]     Insert "INTRINSIC, VALUE, BIND" after "EXTERNAL".

            [194:8]     Insert "DC, RC" after "SP,".

            [194:9-10]  Replace "BN, . . . and P" with "the blank interpretation mode, the sign mode, the decimal edit mode,
            the rounding mode, and the scale factor".

          [11:35+]  Insert "or wait-stmt".
