    INTRODUCTION

       o   Intention of this tutorial
              +   Aim to show that some form of Object Oriented
                  Programming is possible with minimal language
                  change

              +   Reasons for minimal changes to the language:
                     - less painful to implementors
                     - less confusing to users
                     - more chance of OOF being accepted by
                       both implementors and users

       o   Scope of this tutorial 
              +   Introduce and explain "unfamiliar" terminology

              +   Explain the semantics of this terminology

              +   Provide examples (if possible) of how these
                  semantics may be achieved in Fortran

       Notes:

          /oof initially only expects to introduce the basic or "core"
          functionality of Object Orientation, but in a way that may be
          readily extended.

          Any syntactic sugar or "new" constructs are for illustration
          only.

          This tutorial in not a rationale on why Object Oriented
          Programming should be supported in Fortran, that should
          come in the tutorial at the November meeting.

    OBJECT ORIENTED TERMINOLOGY

       o   Encapsulation
              In OOP encapsulation is just information hiding, with
              access to the representation being restricted.

              Manipulation of an object is performed by using the 
              implemented operations or procedures.

              Common in Abstract Data Types, and the mechanism already 
              exists in Fortran with derived-types with PRIVATE components.

       o   Object
              An object in OOP is just a data object, usually some
              form of structure of instance of derived-type.

              May also be thought of as an instance (or value) of an
              abstract data-type.

       o   Class
              A class is set of "things" that are related in behavior
              and/or form.

              For example the Fortran numeric types have similar
              behavior in that the arithmetic operations are defined
              for them.  This could possibly be the class of Number.

       o   Methods or Operations
              In OOP a method is just some sort of procedure that is
              associated (or tagged) to an object or class.

              In OOF a method is just a Fortran procedure, it will 
              usually be defined in a module, but it will be associated
              with a derived-type.

       o   Message Passing
              In OOP a message is passed to an object to:
                 +   enquire about the status of the object
                 +   to manipulate the object in some way.

              Message passing is how OOP refers to procedure calling.
              In all Object Oriented Programming Languages message
              passing is "implemented by" procedure calling.

              For example, the OOP statement:

                 SEND John THE MESSAGE present(oof_tutorial)

              may cause the John object to reflect that a change in
              underwear is required.  The OOP statement:

                 SEND John THE MESSAGE change_underwear

              may cause this change.

              In OOF these messages can be passed to John using the
              normal subroutine or function call:

                 PRESENT(JOHN, OOF_TUTORIAL)
                 CHANGE_UNDERWEAR(JOHN)

       o   Specialization
              Specialization is how the IS_A relationship is referred
              to in OOP.  The IS_A relationship is common and occurs
              when something is more restricted or "specialized" than
              something else e.g.

                 Fortran is_a Programming Language

              Alternatively specialization can be thought of extending
              the behavior and/or the representation of a class or
              object.
              
       o   Inheritance
              Inheritance is typically used to implement specialization,
              or to extend a type or class.

              Typically when B "inherits" from A, the components and 
              procedures that are defined for A are obtained, for free, 
              by B.  With inheritance, A is said to be the "parent" and 
              B is referred to as the "child".

              In OOF inheritance will be referred to as "B extends A".

              Semantically similar to defining a sub-component, of type
              A, in B.  
              
              For example given the following derived-type:

                 TYPE POINT
                    REAL :: X,Y
                 END TYPE POINT

                 then "COLORED_POINT extends POINT" is similar to:

                 TYPE COLORED_POINT
                    TYPE(POINT) :: parent
                    INTEGER :: COLOR
                 END TYPE COLORED_POINT
                 
              However inclusion of the parent component requires access
              to the components of COLORED_POINT using up-to 2 levels
              of component selection.  Only one level of component
              selection is probably more desirable.

              /oof would like to see the following "sort" of derived
              type definition:

                 TYPE COLORED_POINT
                    EXTENDS(POINT) :: PARENT
                    INTEGER :: COLOR
                 END TYPE COLORED_POINT

                 TYPE(COLORED_POINT) :: CP

              Access to the components of COLORED_POINT via CP%X, CP%Y, 
              and CP%COLOR.  Access to the PARENT sub-component as a 
              whole should also be allowed. 
              
              An inheritance chain is when we have the situation
              type B extends type A and type C extends type B; the
              content of the chain is A, B, C.

       o   Polymorphism
              Polymorphism is a form of sub-type/super-type relationship. 
              
              Allows use of an instance of sub-type where an instance of
              super-type is required.

              For example:

                  INTEGER(KIND=1) is usually a sub-type of default
                  integer.

                  INTEGER(KIND=1) can be used in places where a default
                  integer may be used.

              Polymorphism implies a constrained relaxation of the type
              rules, constrained that is so that it operates only on 
              objects of derived-type and where there is some extra
              syntax.

              A procedure is said to be polymorphic when, given that
              B extends A and C extends B, the procedure is:
                 +  generic, and
                 +  the type of its first actual argument is one
                 +   of A, B, or C.

       o   Overloading
              An operator or procedure is "overloaded" if there is more 
              than one operation with the same name, that is distinguished
              by the types of the arguments.

              By default the / operator is overloaded to one "divide" 
              operation that is defined for REALs and a different 
              operation that is defined for INTEGERs.

              This is identical to the Fortran "generic" facility.

       o   Late or Run-time Resolution
              Effectively occurs at the call of a generic procedure
              when given an actual argument whose type is one of an
              inheritance chain.

              Resolution, i.e. selection of the specific procedure
              cannot take place at compile-time as the actual procedure
              selected depends on the actual argument.  Resolution
              must then take place at run-time; hence the name "late
              resolution".

              Some syntactic sugar should be introduced to actually
              indicate that late-resolution may take place.

    EXAMPLES

    ! Ex 1 - overloading, but not polymorphism
    module bp
       type point
          private
          real :: x, y
       end type point

       interface move
          module procedure move
       end interface
    contains
       type(point) function move(p, d, angle)
          type(point), intent(in) :: p
          real, intent(in) :: d, angle
          move%x = ....
          move%y = ....
       end function move
    end module bp

    module cp
       use bp
       type colored_point
          private
          extends(point) :: cpt
          integer :: color
       end type colored_point

       interface move
          module procedure cmove
       end interface move
    contains

       subroutine print_colored_point(p)
          type(colored_point) :: p

          print *, p%x, p%y, p%color
       end subroutine print

       type(colored_point) function cmove(p, d, angle)
          type(colored_point) :: p
          real :: d, angle
          print_colored_point(p)
          cmove%cpt = move(p%cpt, d, angle)
          cmove%color = p%color
       end function cmove
    end module cp

    o  This is not polymorphic as the generic move can be resolved 
       through the first argument.

    // Ex 1a C++
    // file : bp.h
    class point
    {
       public:
          void move(float d, float angle);
       private:
          float x, y;
    };

    void point::move(float d, float angle)
    {
       this->x = ....;
       this->y = ....;
    }
    // eof

    // file : cp.h
    class colored_point : private point
    {
       public:
          void move(float d, float angle, int color);
       private:
          int color;
    };

    void colored_point::move(float d, float angle, int color)
    {
       (point *)this->move(d, angle);
       this->color = color;
    }

    ! Ex 2 - polymorphic example, requiring resolution of the
    !        move procedure to run-time.
    module m1
       private
       public point, move

       type point
          real :: x, y
       end type point

       interface move
          module procedure move
       end interface

       subroutine print(self)

       public colored_point, move

       end type colored_point

       end type point_ptr

       type(point_ptr) :: collection(120)

       call read_em_in(collection)     ! read selection of points

                                       ! determine if collection(i) is
                                       ! type(point) or type(colored_point)

    CONCLUSION

       With this tutorial we hope we have:
          +   introduced and simplified the main OO terminology
          
          +   introduced the basic OO semantics 

          +   shown that supporting Object Oriented Programming 
              can be "relatively" painless.

       Remember:
          +   nothing is concrete
          +   /oof is open to suggestion over additional requirements
              and semantics, and preference over syntax
          +   /oof would like your help.

    FUTURE PLANS
       Nov '96  - Rationale Tutorial
       May '97  - Semantic specs
       Nov '97  - X3J3 consensus on syntax
       May '98  - Edits with no more controversy.

    POSSIBLE STRAW VOTES
       Do people:
          +   agree with the model or notion of inheritance,
              i.e. B extends A ?

          +   agree with the mechanism of associating procedures
              with types ?
