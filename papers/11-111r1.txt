1. Introduction

Unresolved Technical Issue TR1 of N1838 refers to the fact that CLASS(*)
and TYPE(*) entities are both unlimited polymorphic but the conditions
on their use differ.


2. Discussion

There is zero use for TYPE(*),ALLOCATABLE: the only possible actual
argument (other than another TYPE(*),ALLOCATABLE dummy argument) is a
reference to the intrinsic function NULL.

There is no good use for TYPE(*),POINTER: the only actual arguments that
are compatible with this are TARGET objects via automatic pointer
targetting.  Such actual arguments are already adequately catered for via
TYPE(*),TARGET.

Note that if we allow such useless ALLOCATABLE/POINTER TYPE(*) objects, we
will need to disallow them from ALLOCATE/NULLIFY/DEALLOCATE and to restrict
them in argument association.  This paper does not recommend that approach.


3. Edits to N1838

[3:13] Change "CODIMENSION or VALUE"
       to "ALLOCATABLE, CODIMENSION, POINTER, or VALUE".

[3:18+] Delete UTI TR1.
