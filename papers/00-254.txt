The comments are attached below in the same order as the table above.

The summary of results is as follows:

    P = passed                   1  3  4  5 12 29 66
    C = passed as amended
    F = further consideration    P  P  F  C  P  F  F

The interps marked "P" can be considered by WG5 at John Reid's
convenience.

Interp 000005 is marked "C" because I believe that John Reid's
proposed fix {in e-mail SC22WG5.1881 dated 11-Jul-2000} of Henry's
complaint plus adding Henry's 1-argument examples satisfies the NO
votes on 000005.  I have attached the new 000005 to this mail so
000005 is ready for WG5.

The interps marked "F" will be reconsidered at or before J3 meeting
#154 by the /interp committee who will decide if the status becomes
"withdraw for more work", "passed as amended", or "passed as
printed".

         000004    Value returned by MAXVAL/MINVAL

           Malcolm's NO comment on 000004:

             I agree with Henry's comments on this one.  At the very
             least the answer should indicate that a return value of
             -INF/+INF is only acceptable if that value is treated in
             a standard-conforming way by other Fortran facilities
             (e.g. i/o, EXPONENT, SCALE, ...).

             However, since to do this would essentially be to treat
             INF as not infinity but a specific big number (quite
             against the IEEE intentions), a better response is not
             to allow an INF return value until the standard has been
             altered to cope with such values - e.g. by specifying
             i/o formats, return values from EXPONENT, FRACTION,
             SCALE, etc.

           Kurt's YES comment on 000004:

             The key property is that the value returned by a
             reduction operation on a zero-size array be an identity
             for the underlying binary operator.  -HUGE would not be
             an identity for MAX if there are non-model values less
             than -HUGE.

             If my memory isn't playing tricks on me, there are two
             different ways IEEE can be asked to handle infinities:

             1. Both infinity and zero can be signed, and -infinity
                tests less than or equal to everything but NaNs, so
                it is an appropriate value to return from MAXVAL.

             2. Neither infinity nor zero is signed, and infinity is
                not ordered relative to finite values (because it
                could, in effect, be either -infinity or +infinity).
                In this case, infinity would _not_ be an appropriate
                value to return from MAXVAL or MINVAL.

             I don't think I've ever seen a machine running in the
             latter mode, so maybe we don't need to mention it.

           Jon's {et al} YES comment on 000004:

             Perhaps a better response for question 2 would be:

             A program can determine the implementation
             representation of the largest magnitude by evaluating
             the MAXVAL and MINVAL functions with a zero-sized array
             argument. These results can be used as comparison values
             in the program.

               integer,dimension(1:-1)  :: int_zero_sized_array
               integer                  :: int_max_eval,int_min_eval
               real,dimension(1:-1)     :: real_zero_sized_array
               real                     :: real_max_eval,real_min_eval
               real(kind(1.d0)),dimension(1:-1) :: dp_zero_sized_array
               real(kind(1.d0))         :: dp_max_eval,dp_min_eval

               int_max_eval  = maxval (int_zero_sized_array)
               int_min_eval  = minval (int_zero_sized_array)
               real_max_eval = maxval (real_zero_sized_array)
               real_min_eval = minval (real_zero_sized_array)
               dp_max_eval   = maxval (dp_zero_sized_array)
               dp_min_eval   = minval (dp_zero_sized_array)

           Henry's {et al} NO comment on 000004:

             After considering this response and the e-mail discussion
             that surrounded it (particularly, Malcolm's e-mail
             SC22WG5.1766), we felt that it will do a disservice to
             state simply that "IEEE -inf. . .  may be returned on a
             machine that supports the IEEE standard."  We believe
             most users are likely to read the response to this
             interpretation and expect any Fortran processor
             implemented on hardware that supports IEEE inf and -inf
             to return inf and -inf as the results of MINVAL and
             MAXVAL, respectively, when applied to zero-sized arrays.
             We realize that the words "may be" were intended to avoid
             just such an issue arising, but we feel that further
             qualification is required.

             We agree that MAXVAL and MINVAL, when applied to a
             zero-sized array, could return values that are outside of
             the model.  However, it's our belief that if a processor
             returns such a value, it must be a genuine real value of
             the processor; the processor would have to ensure that
             it handles the value in a manner that is consistent with
             the rules of the standard.  We don't believe any
             processor does that today with IEEE inf and -inf.

         000005    Value returned by SELECTED_REAL_KIND

           Malcolm's YES comment on 000005:

             The edit currently reads:

               Page 266, Clause 13.14.95, lines 11-14 (266: 26-29).
               Replace 'the result is -1 ... is supported.' by 'the
               result is -1 if the processor does not support a real
               data type with a precision greater than or equal to P
               but does support a real data type with an exponent
               range greater than or equal to R, -2 if the processor
               does not support a real data type with an exponent
               range greater than or equal to R but does support a
               real data type with a precision greater than or equal
               to P, -3 if the processor supports no real data type
               with either of these properties, and -4 if the
               processor supports real data types for each separately
               but not together.'

             It would be made less ambiguous (qua Henry's comments) by
             inserting after "-4 if" the words "both P and R are
             present and".

           Kurt's YES comment on 000005:

             If I remember correctly, this same issue was brought up
             during the original adoption of SELECTED_REAL_KIND, and
             at that time the subgroup making the proposal claimed
             that there was no need for an additional value to cover
             this case.  (I think they argued that this situation was
             sufficiently unusual that it was not necessary to
             provide for it specially, and that if it occurred, the
             processor could reasonably return either -1 or -2 to
             indicate that it could provide a type that fulfilled one
             of the requirements but could not provide one that met
             both.)

             If we (or a vendor extension) were to provide a third
             property to be used in selecting a REAL kind, the
             "obvious" extension to SELECTED_REAL_KIND would have
             been for -4 to indicate that the new X factor could not
             be satisfied, -5 that the precision and X factor could
             not be satisfied, -6 that the exponent range and X
             factor could not be satisfied, and -7 that all three
             could not be satisfied.  This new meaning for -4 is
             incompatible with that "obvious" extension.

             All this makes me uncomfortable about this
             interpretation, but not sufficiently to justify a no
             vote.

           Jeanne's NO comment on 000005:

             The suggested replacement text is overly specific, but
             still fails to cover cases where one of the optional
             arguments is omitted.  Also adding a new return value
             (-4) is not upwardly compatible with existing
             processors.  It would be simpler to add the phrase, "or
             both are supported but not together" before the period
             at [266:29].

           Jon's {et al} YES comment on 000005:

             We agree with John Reid's comments.

           Matthijs' {et al} YES comment on 000005:

             The proposed edits correctly deal with the cases in
             which both the P and R arguments of the
             SELECTED_REAL_KIND intrinsic are specified.
             Unfortunately, the case in which only one of the two
             arguments is specified is not covered anymore. We
             propose to extend the edit as follows:

             EDITS:
             Page 266, Clause 13.14.95, lines 11-14 (266: 26-29).
             Replace 'the result is -1 ... is supported.' by 'the
             result is as follows:

             Case(i): If both P and R are present, the result is -1
             if the processor does not support a real data type with
             a precision greater than or equal to P but does support
             a real data type with an exponent range greater than
             or equal to R, -2 if the processor does not support a
             real data type with an exponent range greater than or
             equal to R but does support a real data type with a
             precision greater than or equal to P, -3 if the
             processor supports no real data type with either of
             these properties, and -4 if the processor supports real
             data types for each separately but not together.

             Case(ii): If only P is present, the result is -1 if the
             processor does not support a real data type with a
             precision greater than or equal to P.

             Case(iii): If only R is present, the result is -2 if the
             processor does not support a real data type with an
             exponent range greater than or equal to R.'

           Henry's {et al} NO comment on 000005:

             The edits proposed in the response to interpretation
             000005 correctly deal with the cases in which both the P
             and R arguments of the SELECTED_REAL_KIND intrinsic are
             specified.  However, they inadvertently ignore the case
             in which only one of the two arguments is specified.

             So, using the example precision and range values from
             the question, it's not clear from the revised text what
             should be the result of a reference of either of the
             following forms:

               SELECTED_REAL_KIND(P=32)
               SELECTED_REAL_KIND(R=308)

             The existing wording in the standard makes it clear that
             the result of the first reference should be -1, and the
             result of the second should be -2.

           John Reid's comment on 000005 in mail dated 11-JUL-2000:

             Henry Zongaro points out that the proposed rewording
             does not properly allow for the case with only a single
             argument. Since I proposed this text, I thought I would
             prepare a fix.  I think any reader will understand the
             intention, but we might as well correct it. Actually,
             the first part of the sentence (266:23-25) can be viewed
             as broken when one argument is missing.

             A simple way to correct both these is to add at line 23:
             If P or R is absent, the result value is as would have
             been obtained with the argument present with the value
             0.'

         000029    Association of a pointer actual argument with a\
                     dummy argument

           Craig's YES comment on 000029:

             I agree with Kurt Hirchert's comments on this interp,
             but I do not believe that the difficulties he mentions
             should stop approval.

             Proposed new title:  User-defined assignment for
             derived-type components.

             Whether we should use intrinsic assignment always in a
             DATA statement is an issue that should be addressed in a
             separate interp.  The DATA statement case has its own
             set of technical issues and is substantially different
             from the case of an executable assignment statement.

           Malcolm's No comment on 000029:

             I concur with Kurt.  The title should be something like
             "Defined assignment and nested derived types."

             The edits are hopelessly broken.  Back to the drawing
             board.

           Kurt's NO comment on 000029:

             1. This title bears no resemblance to the actual subject
                of the interpretation.  It should be changed.

             2. I am concerned that this interpretation is
                incomplete.  Intrinsic assignment is used for two
                purposes:

                a. It is the meaning given to an assignment statement
                   in the absence of an applicable defined assignment.

                b. It is used for the DATA statement and
                   initialization in a type statement, even if there
                   is an applicable defined assignment.

             I believe that in case (a), we want this modification to
             intrinsic assignment, but that in case (b) we really
             want to retain the F90 behavior, so user procedures
             don't have to be called for static initialization.

           Jeanne's NO comment on 000029:

             The title of M16 and 97-197 is "Derived-Type Assignment
             Fix".  I agree with Kurt that user precedures should not
             be called for static initialization.  - Needs more work.

           Jon's {et al} NO comment on 000029:

             We agree with comments from Kurt, Jeanne, Henry, and
             Malcolm's ballots; user procedures should not be called
             for static initialization.

           Matthijs' {et al} YES comment on 000029:

             We comment that allowing user procedures to be called
             for static initialization is an extension of the
             functionality of Fortran 95, and will introduce changes
             in Fortran processors. The committee might want to
             rethink, whether that is the purpose of the edits.

           Henry's {et al} NO comment on 000029:

             As others have noted, the title doesn't capture the
             essence of the request.

             In 2.2.3, 12.4.3 and in the glossary there appear
             definitions of the word "reference" as it applies to
             subroutines.  They indicate that a reference to a
             subroutine occurs as a result of a CALL statement or a
             defined assignment statement.  This change introduces a
             third place in which a reference to a subroutine can
             occur - namely, in a defined assignment that results
             from a derived-type intrinsic assignment statement.

             We also concur with Kurt's comments on this response.
             The standard uses the term "intrinsic assignment" to
             describe how type conversion is handled for explicit
             initialization, default initialization and structure
             constructors; defined assignment of components has no
             place there.

             We'd like to recommend that a new term be used to
             describe assignment of an expression of a derived type
             to an object of the same type, when intrinsic assignment
             might be used for some components and defined assignment
             for others.  Use of the word "intrinsic" to cover this
             case seems to be confusing.

         000066    Errors in processing data transfer statements

           Kurt's Yes comment on 000066:

             I agree with the basic thrust of this interpretation,
             but I still am concerned about the case of an error
             whose exact location cannot be determined.  For example,
             if a CRC or parity check fails, we know something is
             wrong with the record, but we do not know exactly what.
             Is the processor required to buffer such input so the
             CRC or parity check can be performed _before_ any data
             is transferred?

           Jon's {et al} NO comment on 000066:

             We agree with Henry's comments. The standard is
             intentionally vague here and that no edits should be
             applied.

           Henry's {et al} NO comment on 000066:

             We agree with Kurt that there might still be cases in
             which a processor cannot detect an error that occurs

TITLE: Value returned by SELECTED_REAL_KIND
KEYWORDS: SELECTED_REAL_KIND
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

The SELECTED_REAL_KIND intrinsic function does not appear to cover
one specific case for real data types.  Consider the following
precisions and ranges for a particular model:

    KIND TYPE    PRECISION       RANGE
       4            6             37
       8           15            307
      16           31            291

A test case for a system with this model is:

     PRINT *, 'selrealkind(31,291) = ', SELECTED_REAL_KIND(P=31,R=291)
     PRINT *, 'selrealkind(31,292) = ', SELECTED_REAL_KIND(P=31,R=292)
     PRINT *, 'selrealkind(32,291) = ', SELECTED_REAL_KIND(P=32,R=291)
     PRINT *, 'selrealkind(32,292) = ', SELECTED_REAL_KIND(P=32,R=292)
     END

The Result Value section of the description of SELECTED_REAL_KIND
clearly describes the result value when the values of P and R are
within the ranges specified for the given implementation of the real
data type model.  It further describes the values to be returned by
SELECTED_REAL_KIND when a value of P or R is not within the range of
model numbers specified by the implementation. From the text in the
Result Value section, the following may be determined:

* The reference to SELECTED_REAL_KIND(P=31,R=291) (first PRINT line)
  should return the (kind type parameter) value 16.

* The third and fourth SELECTED_REAL_KIND references should return -1
  since the PRECISION argument is outside the set of allowed
  precision values.

However, the value returned by the second reference to
SELECTED_REAL_KIND is unknown since it does not appear to be covered
by the wording of the Result Value paragraph of section 13.14.95.

1. What should the processor return for the value of the
   SELECTED_REAL_KIND intrinsic function when it does not have a
   single data type that satisfies both the P and R values?

2. In particular, given the precision and range values shown above,
   what should the processor return for the last three invocations of
   the SELECTED_REAL_KIND intrinsic function?

ANSWER:
The intention is that the value -1 be returned if the range can be
supported but the precision cannot,  the value -2 be returned if the
precision can be supported but the range cannot, and the value -3 be
returned if neither the precision nor the range can be supported.
Provision needs to be made for the case where each can be supported,
but not in combination. With the edit below, the returned values for
the four invocations will be 16, -4, -1, -1.

In addition, using the model above, these test cases:

     PRINT *, 'selrealkind(32) = ',    SELECTED_REAL_KIND(P=32)
     PRINT *, 'selrealkind(r=308) = ', SELECTED_REAL_KIND(R=308)

the returned values for the two invocations will be -1, -2.

EDITS:
Page 266, Clause 13.14.95, line 8 (266: 23). After <Result value.>,
add  'If P or R is absent, the result value is as would have been
obtained with the argument present with the value 0.'

Page 266, Clause 13.14.95, lines 11-14 (266: 26-29). Replace 'the
result is -1 ... is supported.' by 'the result is -1 if the processor
does not support a real data type with a precision greater than or
equal to P but does support a real data type with an exponent range
greater than or equal to R, -2 if the processor does not support a
real data type with an exponent range greater than or equal to R but
does support a real data type with a precision greater than or equal
to P, -3 if the processor supports no real data type with either of
these properties, and -4 if the processor supports real data types
for each separately but not together.'
