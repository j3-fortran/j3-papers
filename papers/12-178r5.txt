Discussion:
-----------

This paper proposes syntax, semantics, and edits for feature
3. Collectives in N1930:

A collective subroutine is an intrinsic subroutine that is executed by
a set of images. It performs a computation based on values on the
images of the set. Collective subroutines offer the possibility of
substantially more efficient execution of reduction operations than
would be possible by non-expert programmers. Corresponding routines
are widely used in MPI programs.

C1: A call to a collective subroutine is not an image control
    statement. However, such a call shall appear only in a context
    that allows an image control statement.  Even though calls to
    collective subroutines involve internal synchronization required
    by the usual rules for reference and definition of subroutine
    arguments, they do not facilitate ordering of segments.
    
C2: If a collective subroutine is invoked on one image, it shall be
    invoked by the same statement on all images of the current team.

C3: A collective subroutine based on a user-written procedure that
    applies the required operation to local variables shall be
    provided. In addition, because they are often needed, there should
    be specific collective subroutines for SUM, MAX, and MIN for
    intrinsic types for which the corresponding operations are
    defined.  Forms that provide the result to just one image or to
    all the images involved should be provided. Beyond this, there
    should be a collective subroutine that broadcasts a value on one
    image to a set of images. Coindexed source and result arguments
    are not permitted.

The syntax, semantics, and edits assume the Teams proposal in N1930.


Syntax and Semantics
--------------------

A collective subroutine is one that is invoked on each image of the
current team to perform a calculation on those images and that assigns
the value of the result on all of them or one of them.  If it is
invoked by one image, it shall be invoked by the same statement on all
images of the current team in execution segments that are not ordered
with respect to each other. From the beginning of execution as the
current team, the sequence of calls to collective subroutines shall be
the same on all images of the current team. A call to a collective
subroutine shall appear only in a context that allows an image control
statement.

Each actual argument to a collective subroutine shall have the same
shape, cobounds, and type parameters as the corresponding actual
argument on every other image of the current team. The SOURCE and RESULT
arguments shall not be coindexed.

On any two images calling a collective subroutine, the ultimate
arguments for a coarray dummy argument that is an actual argument to
the collective subroutine shall be corresponding coarrays as described
in 2.4.7 of ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010.

Five collective subroutines are provided:

CO_BROADCAST (SOURCE, SOURCE_IMAGE)  - a collective broadcast

CO_MAX (SOURCE [,RESULT, RESULT_IMAGE])   - maximum value

CO_MIN (SOURCE [,RESULT, RESULT_IMAGE])   - minimum value

CO_REDUCE (SOURCE, OPERATOR [,RESULT, RESULT_IMAGE]) - 
       reduction by a user-specified function

CO_SUM (SOURCE [,RESULT, RESULT_IMAGE])   - SUM reduction

 
CO_BROADCAST copies the value of SOURCE on image SOURCE_IMAGE to the
corresponding SOURCE in the calls on all of the other images in the
current team. SOURCE_IMAGE shall have the same value on all images.

The SOURCE and RESULT arguments may be scalars or arrays. If the
SOURCE argument is an array, the reduction or broadcast is done
separately for each element of the array, broadside across the current
team of images.

The SOURCE and RESULT arguments of CO_MAX, CO_MIN, CO_REDUCE, or
CO_SUM may be coarrays, but that is not required.

If the RESULT argument is present it shall be present on all images
and the computed value is assigned to RESULT; otherwise the computed
value is assigned to SOURCE. If the RESULT_IMAGE argument is present
it shall be present on all images with the same value and the computed
value is assigned only on image number RESULT_IMAGE; otherwise the
computed value is assigned on all images of the current team.


Edits to J3/12-170:
--------------------

[5:5-6] In 3.1 replace the placeholder text with 
"<<collective subroutine>> 
intrinsic subroutine that is invoked on the current team of
images to perform a calculation on those images and assign the
computed value on one or all of them (7.2)"

[13:3-5] In 7.1 replace the first two sentences with "Detailed
specifications of the generic intrinsic subroutines ATOMIC_ADD,
ATOMIC_AND, ATOMIC_CAS, ATOMIC_OR, ATOMIC XOR, CO_BROADCAST, CO_MAX,
CO_MIN, CO_REDUCE, and CO_SUM are provided in 7.3."

[13:10] In 7.2 replace the placeholder text with "A collective
subroutine is one that is invoked on each image of the current team to
perform a calculation on those images and that assigns the computed
value on one or all of them. If it is invoked by one image, it shall
be invoked by the same statement on all images of the current team in
execution segments that are not ordered with respect to each
other. From the beginning of execution as the current team, the
sequence of calls to collective subroutines shall be the same on all
images of the current team. A call to a collective subroutine shall
appear only in a context that allows an image control statement.

If an argument to a collective subroutine is a whole coarray the
corresponding ultimate arguments on all images of the current team
shall be corresponding coarrays as described in 2.4.7 of ISO/IEC
1539-1:2010.

[15:8+] At the end of 7.3 add new subclauses:

"7.3.6  CO_BROADCAST (SOURCE, SOURCE_IMAGE)

Description. Copy a variable to all images of the current team.

Class. Collective subroutine.

Arguments.

SOURCE shall be a coarray. It is an INTENT(INOUT) argument. SOURCE
becomes defined, as if by intrinsic assignment, on all images of the
current team with the value of SOURCE on image SOURCE_IMAGE.

SOURCE_IMAGE shall be of type integer. It is an INTENT(IN)
argument. It shall be an image index and have the same value on all
images of the current team.

Example. If SOURCE is the array [1, 5, 3] on image one, after
execution of CALL CO_BROADCAST(SOURCE,1) the value of SOURCE on all
images of the current team is [1, 5, 3].


7.3.7 CO_MAX (SOURCE [, RESULT, RESULT_IMAGE])

Description. Compute elemental maximum value on the current team of
images.

Class. Collective subroutine.

Arguments.

SOURCE shall be of type integer, real, or character. It is an
INTENT(INOUT) argument. If it is a scalar, the computed value is equal
to the maximum value of SOURCE on all images of the current team. If
it is an array it shall have the same shape and type parameters on all
images of the current team and each element of the computed value is
equal to the maximum value of all the corresponding elements of SOURCE
on the images of the current team.

RESULT (optional) shall be of the same type, type parameters, and
shape as SOURCE. It is an INTENT(OUT) argument. If RESULT is present
it shall be present on all images of the current team. 

RESULT_IMAGE (optional) shall be of type integer. It is an INTENT(IN)
argument. If it is present, it shall be present on all images of the
current team, have the same value on all images of the current team,
and that value shall be an image index.

If RESULT and RESULT_IMAGE are not present, the computed value is
assigned to SOURCE on all the images of the current team. If RESULT is
not present and RESULT_IMAGE is present, the computed value is
assigned to SOURCE on image RESULT_IMAGE and SOURCE on all other
images of the current team becomes undefined.  If RESULT is present
and RESULT_IMAGE is not present, the computed value is assigned to
RESULT on all images of the current team. If RESULT and RESULT_IMAGE
are present, the computed value is assigned to RESULT on image
RESULT_IMAGE and RESULT on all other images of the current team
becomes undefined.  If RESULT is present, SOURCE is not modified.


Example. If the number of images in the current team is two and SOURCE
is the array [1, 5, 3] on one image and [4, 1, 6] on the other image,
the value of RESULT after executing the statement CALL CO_MAX(SOURCE,
RESULT) is [4, 5, 6] on both images.


7.3.8 CO_MIN (SOURCE [, RESULT, RESULT_IMAGE])

Description. Compute elemental minimum value on the current team of
images.

Class. Collective subroutine.

Arguments.

SOURCE shall be of type integer, real, or character. It is an
INTENT(INOUT) argument. If it is a scalar, the computed value is equal
to the minimum value of SOURCE on all images of the current team. If
it is an array it shall have the same shape and type parameters on all
images of the current team and each element of the computed value is
equal to the minimum value of all the corresponding elements of SOURCE
on the images of the current team.

RESULT (optional) shall be of the same type, type parameters, and
shape as SOURCE. It is an INTENT(OUT) argument. If RESULT is present
it shall be present on all images of the current team. 

RESULT_IMAGE (optional) shall be of type integer. It is an INTENT(IN)
argument. If it is present, it shall be present on all images of the
current team, have the same value on all images of the current team,
and that value shall be an image index.

If RESULT and RESULT_IMAGE are not present, the computed value is
assigned to SOURCE on all the images of the current team. If RESULT is
not present and RESULT_IMAGE is present, the computed value is
assigned to SOURCE on image RESULT_IMAGE and SOURCE on all other
images of the current team becomes undefined.  If RESULT is present
and RESULT_IMAGE is not present, the computed value is assigned to
RESULT on all images of the current team. If RESULT and RESULT_IMAGE
are present, the computed value is assigned to RESULT on image
RESULT_IMAGE and RESULT on all other images of the current team
becomes undefined.  If RESULT is present, SOURCE is not modified.

Example. If the number of images in the current team is two and SOURCE
is the array [1, 5, 3] on one image and [4, 1, 6] on the other image,
the value of RESULT after executing the statement CALL CO_MIN(SOURCE,
RESULT) is [1, 1, 3] on both images.


7.3.9 CO_REDUCE (SOURCE, OPERATOR [, RESULT, RESULT_IMAGE])

Description. General reduction of elements on the current team of
images. 

Class. Collective subroutine.

Arguments.

SOURCE is an INTENT(INOUT) argument. It shall not be polymorphic.  If
SOURCE is a scalar, the computed value is the reduction operation of
applying OPERATOR to the values of SOURCE on all images of the current
team. If SOURCE is an array it shall have the same shape and type
parameters on all images of the current team and each element of the
computed value is equal to the value of the reduction operation of
applying OPERATOR to all the corresponding elements of SOURCE on all
the images of the current team.

OPERATOR shall be a pure elemental function with two arguments of the
same type and type parameters as SOURCE. Its result shall have the
same type and type parameters as SOURCE. The arguments and result
shall not be polymorphic. OPERATOR shall implement a mathematically
commutative operation.  If the operation implemented by OPERATOR is
not associative, the computed value of the reduction is processor
dependent.

RESULT (optional) shall be of the same type, type parameters, and
shape as SOURCE. It is an INTENT(OUT) argument. If RESULT is present
it shall be present on all images of the current team. 

RESULT_IMAGE (optional) shall be of type integer. It is an INTENT(IN)
argument. If it is present, it shall be present on all images of the
current team, have the same value on all images of the current team,
and that value shall be an image index.


If RESULT and RESULT_IMAGE are not present, the computed value is
assigned to SOURCE on all the images of the current team. If RESULT is
not present and RESULT_IMAGE is present, the computed value is
assigned to SOURCE on image RESULT_IMAGE and SOURCE on all other
images of the current team becomes undefined.  If RESULT is present
and RESULT_IMAGE is not present, the computed value is assigned to
RESULT on all images of the current team. If RESULT and RESULT_IMAGE
are present, the computed value is assigned to RESULT on image
RESULT_IMAGE and RESULT on all other images of the current team
becomes undefined.  If RESULT is present, SOURCE is not modified.  The
assignment is as if by intrinsic assignment.

The computed value of a reduction operation over a set of values is
the result of an iterative process. Each iteration involves the
execution of \cf{r = OPERATOR(x,y)} for \cf{x} and \cf{y} in the set,
the removal of \cf{x} and \cf{y} from the set, and the addition of
\cf{r} to the set. The process continues until the set has only one
element which is the value of the reduction.

Example. If the number of images in the current team is two and SOURCE
is the array [1, 5, 3] on one image and [4, 1, 6] on the other image,
and MyADD is a function that returns the sum of its two integer
arguments, the value of RESULT after executing the statement CALL
CO_REDUCE(SOURCE, MyADD, RESULT) is [5, 6, 9] on both images.


7.3.10 CO_SUM (SOURCE [, RESULT, RESULT_IMAGE])

Description. Sum elements on the current team of images.

Class. Collective subroutine.

Arguments.

SOURCE shall be of numeric type. It is an INTENT(INOUT) argument.  If
it is a scalar, the computed value is equal to a processor-dependent
and image-dependent approximation to the sum of the values of SOURCE
on all images of the current team. If it is an array it shall have the
same shape on all images of the current team and each element of the
computed value is equal to a processor-dependent and image-dependent
approximation to the sum of all the corresponding elements of SOURCE
on the images of the current team. 

RESULT (optional) shall be of the same type, type parameters, and
shape as SOURCE. It is an INTENT(OUT) argument. If RESULT is present
it shall be present on all images of the current team. 

RESULT_IMAGE (optional) shall be of type integer. It is an INTENT(IN)
argument. If it is present, it shall be present on all images of the
current team, have the same value on all images of the current team,
and that value shall be an image index.

If RESULT and RESULT_IMAGE are not present, the computed value is
assigned to SOURCE on all the images of the current team. If RESULT is
not present and RESULT_IMAGE is present, the computed value is
assigned to SOURCE on image RESULT_IMAGE and SOURCE on all other
images of the current team becomes undefined.  If RESULT is present
and RESULT_IMAGE is not present, the computed value is assigned to
RESULT on all images of the current team. If RESULT and RESULT_IMAGE
are present, the computed value is assigned to RESULT on image
RESULT_IMAGE and RESULT on all other images of the current team
becomes undefined.  If RESULT is present, SOURCE is not modified.

Example. If the number of images in the current team is two and SOURCE
is the array [1, 5, 3] on one image and [4, 1, 6] on the other image,
the value of RESULT after executing the statement CALL CO_SUM(SOURCE,
RESULT) is [5, 6, 9] on both images."


[17:10+] In 8.3 add a new edit to clause 13

"{Move the three paragraphs of subclause 7.2 in this Technical
Specification to follow paragraph 3 and Note 13.1 in Subclause 13.1 of
ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010.}


[17:10++] In 8.3 add a new edit to clause 13

"{In 13.5 Standard generic intrinsic procedures, para 2} 

After the line "A indicates ... atomic subroutine" insert a new line:

C indicates that the procedure is a collective subroutine"


[17:17+] In 8.3 add these entries at the end of the list of 
modifications to Table 13.1 in 13.5 of the base standard}

"CO_BROADCAST (SOURCE, SOURCE_IMAGE) C Copy a variable to

[17:18] In 8.3, second set of edit instructions, replace "7.3.5" with
"7.3.10".

[17:19+] After 8.3, add a new subclause:

"8.4 Edits to annex A

{At the end of A.2 Processor dependencies, replace the final full stop
with a semicolon and add new items as follows}

     \bullet the computed value of the CO_SUM intrinsic function;

     \bullet the computed value of the CO_REDUCE intrinsic function."


[19:4-5] Replace the placeholder text in Annex A with

"A.1 Clause 7 notes

A.1.1 Collective subroutine examples

The following example computes a dot product of two scalar coarrays
using the co_sum intrinsic to store the result in a noncoarray scalar
variable:

  real, save :: x[*],y[*],xy[*]
  real x_dot_y
!Initialize x and y
  x = this_image() 
  call random_number(y)
  xy = x*y
  call co_sum(xy,x_dot_y)

The function below demonstrates passing a noncoarray dummy argument to
the co_max intrinsic.  The function uses co_max to find the maximum
value of the dummy argument across all images.  Then the function
flags all images that hold values matching the maximum.  The function
then returns the maximum image index for an image that holds the
maximum value:

  function find_max(j) result(j_max_location)
    integer, intent(in) :: j
    integer j_max,j_max_location
    call co_max(j,j_max)
! Flag images that hold the maximum j
    j_max_location = merge(this_image(),0,j==j_max)
! Return highest image index associated with a maximal j 
    call co_max(j_max_location) 
  end function find_max
