NUMBER: F03/0100
TITLE: Error in field width for special cases of signed INFINITY output
KEYWORDS: formatted output, signed infinity
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress


QUESTION:

Is there an error in the description for the output of a IEEE infinity
with a sign and a field width of 3 or 8?

228:36-37 describes the output for an IEEE infinity and special cases
field widths of 3 and 8.  But, the special casing doesn't consider the
possibility of a plus or minus sign in the field.  A signed infinity
should be special cased for field widths of 9 and 4.


ANSWER:

Yes, there is an error in the special cases.  Edits are provided to
correctly describe the required field widths for signed infinities.

EDITS:

[228:36-37]  In the paragraph beginning "For an internal value that is an
IEEE infinity." in 10.6.1.2.1 change "If <w> is less than 3" to
"If no sign is produced and <w> is less than 3".

Add after that sentence:
"If a sign is produced and <w> is less than 4, the field is filled with
asterisks; otherwise, if <w> is less than 9, the sign followed by 'Inf'
is produced. "
