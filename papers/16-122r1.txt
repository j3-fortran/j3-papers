1. Introduction
===============

9.10.2.22 is silent concerning the status of the variable in a POS=
specifier in an INQUIRE statement if there is a pending data transfer
for the specified unit.  The simplest solution is to make the INQUIRE a
wait operation if POS= appears.

2. Edits
========

[xvi Introduction, under Input/output] Insert a sentence: "If there are
pending data transfer operations for the unit specified in an INQUIRE
statement and a POS= specifier appears, the value assigned is computed
as if all the pending data transfers had already completed."

[244:7 9.10.2.22p1] Insert a sentence before the one that begins "If
there is no connection...":  "If there are pending data transfer
operations for the specified unit, the value assigned is computed as if
all the pending data transfers had already completed."

{Compare to 9.10.2.17.}
