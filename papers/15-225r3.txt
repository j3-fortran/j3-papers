1. Edits
========

[17:26 1.3.136.1 "executable statement"]
 Change "<specification-part>"
 to     "<block-specification-part>".

[169:25 8.1.2.2p2 "Execution of a block"]
 Replace the bullet
     "o the last executable construct in the sequence is executed,"
 with
     "o execution of the last executable construct in the block
        completes without branching to a statement within the block,".
 {Consider, for example:
   IF (whatever) THEN
        PRINT *,'hello block stmt 1'
   100  I = I - 1
        PRINT *,'Hello I',I
        IF (I>0) GOTO 100
   END IF

  The last executable construct in the block is "IF (I>0) GOTO 100",
  but executing this does not terminate the block unless I<=0.}

[169:27-29 8.1.2.2p2 "Execution of a block"]
 Append "or" at [169:27]
 to     "a RETURN statement within the block is executed,".
 Replace the next two bullets [169:28-29] with
  "o  an EXIT or CYCLE statement that belongs to a construct
      that contains the block is executed.".
 {EXIT and CYCLE statements do not belong to blocks;  they belong to
  constructs}

[171:1 8.1.3.3p1 "Other attributes of associate names"]
 Change "The cobounds"
 to     "If the selector is a coarray, the cobounds".

[172:1 8.1.4 "BLOCK construct"]
 Change "C807 (R807) "The block-specification-part of a BLOCK construct
         shall"
 to     "C807 (R807) "A block-specification-part shall"

 C807 will now read

  "C807 (R807) A <block-specification-part> shall not contain a COMMON,
  EQUIVALENCE, INTENT, NAMELIST, OPTIONAL, statement function, or VALUE
  statement." (Note that statement function is in obsolete font.)

[177:12 8.1.6.4.4p1 "CYCLE statement"]
 Change "CYCLE statement from that belongs"
 to     "CYCLE statement that belongs"
{typo}

[178:6 8.1.6.5 "Additional semantics for DO CONCURRENT constructs"]
 In C829 change "a nonpure"
 to             "an impure".
{that's the term we use elsewhere}

[178:43 8.1.6.5p5 "Additional semantics for DO CONCURRENT constructs"]
 Change "the ordering between records"
 to     "the ordering of records".

[180:0+2 8.1.6.6 "Examples of DO constructs"]
 In NOTE 8.14] change "The following example represents"
 to                   "The following example illustrates".

[181:19-20 8.1.7.4p2 "Execution of an IF construct"]
 In     "is not executed and execution continues"
 delete "and execution continues".

[187:18 8.2.1p1 "Branch concepts"]
 Set "a computed GO TO statement" in obsolescent font.

[195:28 8.5.8p2 "LOCK and UNLOCK statements"]
 Change "to become defined after"
 to     "to become locked after".

[195:35 8.5.8p5 "LOCK and UNLOCK statements"]
 Change "During the execution of the program,"
 to     "During execution of the program,".

[197:26 8.5.9p5 "STAT= and ERRMSG= specifiers in image control statements"]
 Change "assigned, as if by intrinsic assignment, an explanatory message"
 to     "assigned an explanatory message as if by intrinsic assignment".
 {compare to 9.11.6}

[484:12 16.4p1"Statement and construct entities"]
 Before "Two construct entities" insert a sentence"
  "A variable that has LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT locality in a DO CONCURRENT
   construct is a construct entity.".
