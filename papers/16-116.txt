In 7.1.4 Evaluation of operations, "<forall-assignment-stmt>" should
be in the obsolescent font. Forall is obsolescent in F2015.

In the syntax rule for "<primary>", R701, we switched, between F95 and
F2003 from "variable" to "designator". This change seems to have ben
made in other, related places, except in the first sentence of 7.1.9.2
Type, type parameters, and shape of a primary, where we repeat the
list of options from R701, except for using "variable" in the place of
"designator". This seems inconsistent.

[143:5] In 7.1.4 Evaluation of operands, para 2, convert
"<forall-assignment-stmt>" to the smaller obsolescent font.

[152:24,28] In 7.1.9.2 Type, type parameters, and shape of a primary,
para 1, change "variable" to "designator" thrice (once in the first
sentence, and twice in the sentence beginning "If it is a
variable...").
