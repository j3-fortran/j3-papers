            Minutes of INCITS/J3 Committee Meeting #172

0.  List of papers passed at meeting #172

    No papers were passed at meeting #172 per se, or voted on.
    However, repository items were agreed upon as part of the
    concurrent WG5 meeting, and some papers were revised in response
    to straw votes taken by WG5.  This is a list which attempts to
    match repository items to the most recent paper which reflects
    the respository item as voted at Delft WG5, if there was
    a change at this meeting.

1.  Monday, May 9, 2005

1.1 Opening business - D. Nagle

    The meeting was called to order at 9:00 AM, Monday, May 9, 2005,
    at NEN, the Dutch Standardisation Institute, Vlinderweg 6, by the
    chair, Dan Nagle.

1.1.1 Remarks from the chair - D. Nagle

    This meeting will be conducted as a simultaneous J3-WG5 meeting,
    with chairs Dan Nagle (when in J3 mode) and John Reid (when in
    WG5 mode).

1.1.2 Adoption of agenda - D. Nagle

**  motion: adopt the agenda (moved by Hendrickson/seconded by
            Snyder): passed by unanimous consent {uc}

    The final agenda is in Appendix A

1.1.3 Approval of Meeting 171 minutes - D. Nagle

**  motion: approve meeting #171 minutes paper J3/05-166 (Snyder/
            James): uc

1.1.4 INCITS/OMC report - D. Nagle

    The annual report is due before the end of this month.  Dan Nagle
    will need to report this quickly.  D. Nagle expects to be able
    to include the Delft meeting.

    D. Nagle/V. Snyder are getting the usual support from INCITS.

1.1.5 ISO/WG5 report - V. Snyder, IR

    Nothing more to report.  A J3-UStag meeting will be held
    later in the week.

1.1.6 J11 Liaison report  - C. Rasmussen

    Craig Rasmussen has not yet shown the revised paper to J11.

1.1.7 H2 Liaison report - D. Nagle

    H2 is currently working on fitting XML into SQL.  Since XML is
    not structured and SQL is very structured, this is non-trivial.

1.1.8 IEEE 754 report (if any) - M. Ingrassia

    No report

1.1.9 Treasurer's report

    M. North did not attend and thus did not deliver a treasurer's
    report in person.  However, no J3 funds were collected or
    disbursed at this meeting.  A WG5 meeting fee will be collected.

1.1.10 Beginning membership report - D. Nagle

    Stan Whitlock being absent, Dan Nagle supplied the membership
    report.  He noted that presence/absence at an overseas meeting
    does not normally affect membership status.

    Total membership at the beginning of this meeting is 11, with
    9 members present or represented.

    Members present:

      D. Nagle (Chair)

    Check with Aleks for paper numbers

1.1.14 Comments from members

    D. Nagle reported that George Mason University would like to
    host the February joint J3/WG5 meeting.  Bill Long noted that would
    be more expensive than Las Vegas, but acceptable as a one-time 
    change of venue.  D. Nagle would like to organize a trip to the
    air and space museum at Dulles airport (this is not the small
    museum downtown which is one of the most-visited museums in the
    world). 

    Schedule calls for completion of edits by next May, with final
    choice of features by February, 2006.

    US (J3), Russia, and UK submitted lists of recommendations for
    Repository items.  These are summarized and given code numbers in
    N1626, the WG5 Repository of Requirements.

    Usual J3 subgroups will look at repository items and recommend to
    WG5 plenary whether to adopt item as a requirement or
    recommendation for Fortran 2008.  For bigger items, subgroups will
    prepare a presentation.

    J3 working subgroups are augmented by those WG5 members in
    attendance.  All subgroup members have a vote/voice in subgroup.

    J3 repository J3/05-009 was merged into N1626.  By general
    agreement, J3 revision J3/05-009r1 was to be considered by
    subgroup as superseding N1626 in case of overlap.

    RU-05:  inclined to parcel to other subgroups
            Remanded back to subgroup for further consideration.

2. Tuesday, May 10, 2005  9:00 am

2.1 F200x Plenary (00-010)                        Subgroup Heads

    John Reid said that the goal for today was to have presentations
    for all the big features proposed.

2.2 Tutorials (if needed)

    Bill Long gave presentation (3 slides) on contiguous arrays J3-043

    recessed for lunch

2.2 Tutorials (if needed) (1 PM)

    Van Snyder gave presentation on parametrized modules.

    Bill Long gave presentation on TYPELESS.

      Straw vote:
        Prefer proposal as written
          (TYPELESS objects are 32 or 64 bits)   4
        Prefer arbitrary length bit strings     10
        Don't care                               4

      Subsequent votes on J3-047 are taken to refer to "variable-size
      bit strings". 

      Change name from TYPELESS to BITS - unanimous consent

    This concluded presentations on the "big ticket" items.

    Straw vote on co-arrays (UK-001), bits (J3-047), parametrized
    modules (J3-014):

      do none of them                      3

    Plenary to reconvene Friday AM and resume with this item.

5.0 Friday, May 13, 2005  9:00 am

    It's "logical Thursday".  Resume Subgroup meetings for the
    rest of the morning, then hear subgroup reports at 2 PM.

  JOR report

    RU-03 subgroup recommends adding only
            BLOCK DATA
            ENTRY
            DOUBLE PRECISION (just these literal words, not for
                              example D0 literals)
          to the obsolescent list (in particular, not .GT.-style
          comparators) , and
          Statement Functions to the deleted list
    RU-05 subgroup defined a short list of HPF functions which it
           recommends adding as intrinsics
          The intrinsics are array functions with well-defined values
           and do not presuppose working in a parallel environment.
          See paper J3/05-185.

  In WG5 mode revisited some unsettled issues previously, and
  reconfirmed by straw vote (not recorded here) that J3-047 refers to
  arbitrary-length objects not fixed-size.

5.0 [4.5] Subgroup reports  2:00 PM

    Papers will be added to repository to reflect the agreed-upon
    definitions of features.

    J3/05-183r1 John Reid will write for the postmeeting.

  INTERP report

    Rob James said there would be no Interps reported out of INTERP
    subgroup at this meeting.  However, progress was made in
    discussing papers from the premeeting, and they will be
    re-distributed for the next J3 meeting. 

  JOR report

    N1636 technical corrigendum  looks right, the editorial changes
    are sufficiently small.  David Muxworthy said there are 2 minor
    editorial glitches to check. 

  EDIT report

    Malcolm Cohen reported that edit subgroup processed N1621 and a
    revised version will appear at some point in the future, but not
    at this meeting.  Since WG5 has not delegated maintenance of EM
    TR to J3, that will need to wait for the next WG5 meeting.

    Since time was available a decision was made to discuss the 3's
    (items in repository with dificulty level of 3 on the Reid scale)
    in plenary without subgroup recommendation.  Those discussed and
    voted as WG5 are 

      J3-008
      J3-020
      J3-027
      J3-010
      J3-023
        WG5 straw voted extending with *'s for all dimensions as
        proposed by M. Cohen and this became the version WG5 voted
        priority on;  V. Snyder will do J3-189 for the respository.
      J3-034
      J3-001
      J3-024
      J3-025
