NUMBER: F03/0071
TITLE: Subroutine/function ambiguity in generics
KEYWORDS: subroutine, generic, implicit
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

 Q1. Is the following generic allowed?

     interface q
       subroutine qr(f)
         implicit real(f)
         external f
       end subroutine
       subroutine qc(f)
         implicit complex(f)
         external f
       end subroutine
     end interface q

     The uncertainly arises because it is not established
     whether F is a subroutine or a function. If either F
     were a subroutine, then it would be clear that the
     generic was disallowed. One might be able to use this
     to deduce that both Fs must be functions. This seems
     like an obscure deduction to demand of the compiler.

 Q2. Consider the following "obviously" allowed generic

     module m
       interface q
         subroutine qr(f)
           real, external :: f
         end subroutine
         subroutine qc(f)
           complex, external :: f
         end subroutine
       end interface q
     end module m

     Is the following main program valid?

     program main
       use m
       external ff
       call q(ff)
     end

     Again, the problem is that it is unclear whether or not
     ff is a function or subroutine. If it is a subroutine,
     then the call is ambiguous. One might thus deduce that
     ff must be a function, and therefore of type real,
     but this seems like an obscure deduction to demand of
     the compiler.

ANSWER:

1. The program fragment is not conforming.  A generic interface is
   required to be nonambiguous.  This is a similar situation to the
   declaration of an external procedure in a module, where a procedure
   that is a function is required to have its type and type parameters
   explicitly declared.  An edit is provided to require this for
   specific procedures in a generic interface.

2. The main program is conforming.  As remarked, at the call site the
   procedure is known to be either a subroutine or a function.  Since
   the generic does not allow a subroutine as an argument, it must
   therefore be a function.  Implicit typing means that ff is real so
   qr is called.  (The generic cannot have a specific that
   accepts a subroutine as an argument, as that would violate the
   requirements in 16.2.3.)

EDITS:

[261:3] In 12.3.2.1 Interface block,
  immediately after "A generic interface is always explicit.",
  append new sentence to paragraph
    "If a specific procedure in a generic interface has a function dummy
     argument, that argument shall have its type and type parameters
     explicitly declared in the specific interface."
{I.e. if you just say EXTERNAL dummy, you must mean a subroutine.}
