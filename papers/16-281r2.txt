~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[209:6] and [210:3] 11.6.5 SYNC MEMORY statement
  replace "defined, referenced" by "nonatomically defined, nonatomically
  referenced", twice.

Discussion:
This is a technical change that removes functionality used for
user-defined synchronization schemes.

[210:6+]: 11.6.5 SYNC MEMORY statement p. 2
Add sentence
  "If P is the same image as Q, atomic definitions or references to
   X before the SYNC MEMORY precede atomic definitions or references to
   Y after the SYNC MEMORY statement."

{this appears to be necessary to continue ensuring that such defs and
 refs are not moved across the SYNC MEMORY by the optimizer}.

Discussion:

This edit is no longer relevant if the edits at [209:6] and [210:3]
are not done.
