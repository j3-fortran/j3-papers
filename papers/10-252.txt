This paper documents the changes made to the Draft Interoperability
TR, 10-1652.pdf, to make 10-251.pdf.  References are to 10-165r2.


Changes from passed Meeting 193 Papers:

10-203r2 done.

10-204r3 done.

10-205r4 done

10-215   done (First Edit only)

10-216   done

10-217r1 done.

10-219r1 done

10-220r2 done

10-229r1 : The second edit at [12:17] is a mistake and was not
entered. It contradicts the edit at [12:14-17], which explicitly
changed CFI_is_contiguous to NOT return an error indicator.

10-232r4 :

1) The last line of the description of dim [ ]:

    "The number of elements in an object of type CFI_cdesc_t shall be
    equal to the rank of the object."

makes no sense. An object of type CFI_cdesc_t always has rank
one. Replaced with:

    "The number of elements in the array shall be equal to the rank of
    the object."

2) Put text for CFI_CDESC_T before CFI_MAX_RANK {alphabetical}

3) Changed 'DESC' to 'CDESC' throughout.

4) Changed "is" to "-" after CFI_CDESC_T to match the form of the
other macro descriptions.

5) Moved Note to after the Note for version.


Additional Changes:


Throughout Clause 5: The \cf font specification for
ISO_Fortran_binding.h and other code symbols in inline text was
repaired so that the whole word is in code font rather than just the
first letter.

[12:6] "desriptor" -> "descriptor" {spelling typo}
