Questions and comments that are more than editorial.

[117:10] Should we allow the leftmost thing to also be
a pointer expression?

[117:13] What is purpose of this? Does it disallow
array[7] and require array(:)[7]?

[118:note 6.7] Do co-arrays affect this description? I
think they should be included.

[118:13] Does this disallow CPF(args)%RE = 0
whereas CPF(args) = 0
is allowed (where CPF is a pointer function
that returns a pointer to a complex thing)?

[119:4] Same question as above

[119:16] Should that be "section subscript or subscript list"
Array(1:10) isn't a whole array. See R619 on 120

[122:18-20] This probably should say "variable definition
context" rather than only list two things.
They surely can't be the IOMSG thing, nor
an internal write unit, etc.

[124:C627, C629] Do we also need MOLD= here? In general,
shouldn't almost all instances of "SOURCE=" be
replaced by "SOURCE= or MOLD=" or "source-expr"?

[125:note 6.20, last line] This isn't a "reason". We
allow A[Q] = 0, and that's not necessarily
executed on image Q

[130:1] Add something like "but the same thing will happen
on all images." Or, was the intent to actually
make it be processor dependent? See also [72:1]
for finalizers.

[131:1] It doesn't say it here, but I bet the deallocations
can occur in a processor dependent order. I think
clause 4 says that. Then we need words to say the
images do it in the same order.

[131:11] It's not just these three. The termination of any
executable construct can cause automatic
deallocation, see 130:2-5

[131:19] There was a recent conflict on comp.lang.fortran
about what "associated with the whole of an
object" means. Suppose I do
ALLOCATE(A(10))
and then do (Ps are all array pointers
P0 => A
P1 => A(:)
P2 => A(1:10)
P3 => A(10:1:-1)
P4 => A(1:N) !assume N=10
P5 => A(M:N) !assume N:M = 1:10
p6(1:2,1:5) => A !rank remap
which pointers can I use in a DEALLOCATE?
or, if I do
ALLOCATE (A(1))
P_SCALAR => A
can I do
DEALLOCATE (P_SCALAR)?
