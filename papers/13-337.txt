Discussion
----------

From m201 discussion: Eliminate the "subteam" terminology and use TEAM
instead. FORM TEAM and teamID, for example. The current subteam
terminology is based on a perspective of the collected set of images.
But from the perspective of any executing image (which is how the
program is written) the members of its collection of the parent team
are the members of its TEAM.  This change would clean up the wording.

Modifications include a global replace of "subteam" by "team" and
cleaning up surrounding text.
