0. Prelude

This paper is identical to 15-150r2, except for the location of the
edits, and typos, which have been updated to refer to 15-007r1.
Some explanation has also been wittered.

1. Introduction
===============

The intent of the restrictions listed in (8.1.6.5) is to allow a
processor to parallelize the code inside a DO CONCURRENT construct
without causing any race condition. However, there are issues as
illustrated in the following cases:

Case 1:

  REAL X
  X = 1.0
  DO CONCURRENT(...)
    IF (condition) THEN
      X = something
      ...                ! code using X
    END IF
    ...                  ! code that doesn't use X
  END DO

In case 1, a processor cannot localise X, because if "condition"
is true exactly once, the assignment affects the "outer" X. OTOH,
if condition is true more than once, a processor cannot execute in
parallel without localising X.


Case 2:

  REAL X
  X = 1.0
  DO CONCURRENT(...)
    CALL sub(X)
    ...                  ! code referencing X
  END DO

In case 2, a processor is not able to detect
1. if X is defined (or becomes undefined) in sub, and
2. how many iterations that defines or undefines X as the condition
could be in sub.

Both Case 1 and 2 are standard conforming.

It is understood that users can use a BLOCK construct to localize
variables, but a processor still needs to be able to handle all the
standard conforming code when the BLOCK construct is not used.

In order to still be able to parallelize code such as in Case 1 and
2, a processor needs to always localize x and copy-in the initial
value and also copy-out the value at every possible point X could
be defined or become undefined.

The performance impact described at the above is not the intent
of the standard, a proposal is made to eliminate the indetermination.


2. Proposal
===========

Since a processor is not able to determine if a variable can be referenced
by all iterations without causing a race condition, it would be critical to
provide a mechanism to allow users to explicitly specify their intent of
how a variable is expected to be used.

A new syntax as follows is introduced to achieve that: change loop-control
to have "concurrent-locality" after "concurrent-header", thus only
affecting the DO CONCURRENT statement.

  R8nn concurrent-locality is [ locality-spec ]...

  R7xx locality-spec is LOCAL ( variable-name-list )
                     or LOCAL_INIT ( variable-name-list )
                     or SHARED ( variable-name-list )
                     or DEFAULT ( NONE )

New rules:
1. Variables appearing in the variable-name-list of a LOCAL_INIT specifier
   shall be previously defined.
2. When parallelization is enabled, a local copy of a variable that appears
   in the variable-name-list of the LOCAL specifier is created for each
   iteration. Such a local copy is initially undefined.
3. When parallelization is enabled, a local copy of a variable that appears
   in the variable-name-list of the LOCAL_INIT specifier is created for
   each iteration.  Such a local copy is initialized to the value of the
   corresponding variable specified by the LOCAL_INIT specifier.
4. Variables that appear in the variable-name-list of the SHARED specifier
   are common to all iterations; a shared variable shall not be defined or
   become undefined in more than one iteration.  A shared variable that is
   defined or becomes undefined in one iteration shall not be referenced in
   any other iteration.  In the case of arrays, these requirements apply to
   each element individually. In the case of derived types, these
   requirements apply to the ultimate components.
5. If DEFAULT (NONE) appears, all variables referenced or defined within
   the loop, other than the loop iteration variables, shall have their
   locality explicitly declared.
6. A variable can only appear in at most one of the LOCAL, LOCAL_INIT, or
   SHARED specifiers.
9. A LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT variable with the ALLOCATABLE attribute will be
   automatically deallocated at the end of each iteration if it is
   allocated.
10. An assumed-size array shall not appear in LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT.
11. A DO CONCURRENT index cannot appear in a locality-spec for that
    loop.  It seems to be ok to let it appear in a locality-spec for
    an outer DO CONCURRENT when there are nested DO CONCURRENT constructs
    though.

Removed (was new) rules:
7. The name of an array whose subscripts involve index-names of
   a DO CONCURRENT construct shall not appear in the
   variable-name-list of the LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT specifier.
Because: there is no such restriction in the current text.  This would be
         quite difficult to state accurately, and is broken (not just
         useless) if stated inaccurately.  Of course it's possible that
         no-one actually implements the current text, which can localise
         the whole array in some cases...
8. It is recommended that a scalar variable or an array whose subscripts do
   not involve index-names of a DO CONCURRENT construct that does not
   appear in any locality-spec not be defined or become undefined in any
   iteration.
Because: There is some controversy over this recommendation, and it is
         difficult to state accurately.  We *could* just do scalars...

Note: There are some difficulties with interpreting such things as
      references to A(MOD(I,2)+1) in a DO CONCURRENT, it clearly depends
      on the index I but also seems likely that multiple iterations will
      want their own copies and therefore they should be localisable.
      If we can work this out, we could reconsider reinstating these
      rules (with appropriate modifications).

Note: There are also issues with finalization.  A LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT
      variable is a new entity in each iteration, and therefore needs
      to be finalized at the end of each iteration.


3. Examples
===========

IMPLICIT NONE
INTEGER :: N = 10
REAL :: X, Y, Z, R
X = 1.0
Y = 2.0
Z = 3.0
R = 4.0
DO CONCURRENT (INTEGER :: I = 1 : N) LOCAL (X, R) LOCAL_INIT (Y) SHARED (Z)
  X = I + 1.0       !! X HAS VALUE OF I + 1.0
  R = Y             !! R HAS VALUE OF 2.0
  IF (I == 1) THEN
    Z = 4.0
  END IF
END DO
PRINT*, X           !! 1.0
PRINT*, Y           !! 2.0
PRINT*, Z           !! 4.0
PRINT*, R           !! 4.0
END

4. Edits to 15-007r1
====================

[79:2+] 4.5.6.3 When finalization occurs, p4+, insert new paragraph
  "A nonpointer nonallocatable variable with LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT locality
  in a DO CONCURRENT construct is finalized when execution of each
  iteration completes.".
{Specify that these are finalised, just as if they were BLOCK construct
 entities within the DO CONCURRENT construct.}

[176:23] 8.1.6.2 Form of the DO construct, R817 loop-control,
         After "<concurrent-header>"
         Insert "<concurrent-locality>"

[176:29+] Same subclause, after R823 concurrent-step, insert new BNF
  "R823a <concurrent-locality> <<is>> [ <locality-spec> ]...

   R823b <locality-spec> <<is>> LOCAL ( <variable-name-list> )
                         <<or>> LOCAL_INIT ( <variable-name-list> )
                         <<or>> SHARED ( <variable-name-list> )
                         <<or>> DEFAULT ( NONE )

[177:2+] Same subclause, before R824 end-do, insert constraints
  "C8xx A <variable-name> in a <locality-spec> shall be the name of a
        variable in the scoping unit that is not an assumed-size array and
        is not the same as an <index-name> in the <concurrent-header> of
        the same DO CONCURRENT statement.

   C8xx The name of a variable shall not appear in more than one
        <variable-name-list>, or more than once in a <variable-name-list>,
        in a <locality-spec>.

   C8xx A variable that is referenced by the <scalar-mask-expr> of a
        <concurrent-header> or by any <concurrent-limit> or
        <concurrent-step> in that <concurrent-header> shall not appear in a
        LOCAL <locality-spec> in the same DO CONCURRENT statement.

   C8xx If the <locality-spec> DEFAULT ( NONE ) appears in a DO CONCURRENT
        statement, a variable that appears in the <block> of the construct
        and is not an <index-name> of that construct shall have its
        locality explicitly specified.".
{Add new syntax and constraints.
 A variable used in the mask expression cannot be LOCAL as it would then
 be undefined when the mask is evaluated, but being LOCAL_INIT is ok.}

[179:27] 8.1.6.5 Restrictions on DO CONCURRENT constructs, heading,
         rename to "Additional semantics for DO CONCURRENT constructs".

[179:36] Same subclause, before p1, replace opening sentence with new
         paragraphs and opening as follows:
  "The locality of a variable that appears in a DO CONCURRENT construct is
   LOCAL, LOCAL_INIT, SHARED, or unspecified.

   A variable that has LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT locality is a construct entity
   with the same attributes as the variable with the same name outside the
   construct, and the outside variable is inaccessible by that name within
   the construct.  At the beginning of execution of each iteration,
   - if a variable with LOCAL locality is allocatable it is unallocated, if
     it is a pointer it has undefined pointer association status, and
     otherwise it is undefined except for any subobjects that are
     default-initialized;
   - a variable with LOCAL_INIT locality has the allocation, pointer
     association, and definition status of the outside variable with that
     name; the outside variable shall not be an undefined pointer or a
     nonallocatable nonpointer variable that is undefined.
   When execution of that iteration completes, an allocatable variable with
   LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT locality will be automatically deallocated.

   If a variable has SHARED locality, appearances of the variable within
   the DO CONCURRENT construct refer to the variable in the scoping unit.
   If it is defined or becomes undefined during any iteration, it shall not
   be referenced, defined, or become undefined during any other iteration.
   If it is allocated or deallocated during an iteration it shall not have
   its allocation or association status, dynamic type, array bounds, shape,
   or a deferred type parameter value inquired about in any other
   iteration.

   If a variable has unspecified locality,"
[179:37] "A variable that is referenced in an iteration shall"
         -> "if it is referenced in an iteration it shall",
[179:38] ". A variable that is" -> "\item if it is".
[179:39] "iteration becomes" -> "iteration it becomes",
         "terminates." -> "terminates;".
[179:40] "A pointer that" -> "if it is a pointer and",
[179:41] "nullification, shall" -> "nullification, it shall",
[180:1] ". A pointer that has its pointer association"
         -> "\item if it is a pointer whose pointer association is",
[180:2] "iteration has" -> "iteration, it has",
[180:3] "If an allocatable object" -> "if it is allocatable and",
[180:4] ". An allocatable object that"
         ->"; \item if it is allocatable and",
[180:6] "shall either" -> "it shall either".

This makes the 179:37-180:7 text read:
 "If a variable has unspecified locality,
  - if it is referenced in an iteration it shall either be previously
    defined during that iteration, or shall not be defined or become
    undefined during any other iteration;
  - if it is defined or becomes undefined by more than one iteration it
    becomes undefined when the loop terminates;
  - if it is a pointer and is used in an iteration other than as the
    pointer in pointer assignment, allocation, or nullification, it shall
    either be previously pointer associated during that iteration or shall
    not have its pointer association changed during any iteration;
  - if it is a pointer and has its pointer association changed in more than
    one iteration, it has an association status of undefined when the
    construct terminates;
  - if it is allocatable and is allocated in more than one iteration, it
    shall have an allocation status of unallocated at the end of every
    iteration;
  - if it is allocatable and is referenced, defined, deallocated, or has
    its allocation status, dynamic type, or a deferred type parameter value
    inquired about, in any iteration, it shall either be previously
    allocated in that iteration or shall not be allocated or deallocated in
    any other iteration.".

[180:8-10] De-itemise lines 8-9 and prepend to line 10 (removing from p1),
           so that p2 now contains both the requirements on concurrent
           i/o.
{Organisational improvement.}

[181:0+lots] Between NOTES 8.15 and 8.16, which are just before
             8.1.7 IF construct and statement,
             insert new NOTE
"NOTE 8.15a
 The following code demonstrates the use of the LOCAL clause so that the
 X inside the DO CONCURRENT construct is a temporary variable, and won't
 affect the X outside the construct.

        X = 1.0
        DO CONCURRENT (I=1:10) LOCAL(X)
          IF (A(I)>0) THEN
            X = SQRT(A(I))
            A(I) = A(I) - X**2
          END IF
          B(I) = B(I) - A(I)
        END DO
        PRINT *,X ! Always prints 1.0.
".
{Add the simplest example.}
