2    Opening Business
2.1  Meeting Objectives & Chair's Report
     1.  Process remaining interpretations
     2.  Provide X3H5 input on the draft Fortran 90 binding
     3.  Prepare requirements for WG5
2.2  Adoption of the Final Agenda
     Discussion Leader: Jerry Wagener
     Motion: (Lauson/Whitlock) Adopt the agenda as modified.
     Action: Passed by unanimous consent.
2.3  X3/OMC (SPARC) Report
     Discussion Leader: Jerry Wagener
     References: 93-012, 93-109, 93-110, 93-128
     Note:   The liaison for the BSI and the BCS should be
             Miles Ellis.
     Wagener: [Reviewed 93-128 from the annual report to the
             OMC presentation.  Jerry had recommended that
             the ISO processing be done first and that ANSI
             adopt the resulting ISO document and the OMC
             agreed.  One member suggested that the
             interpretations be contained in an annex and
             that all 006 items should contain an edit which
             in the case of an interpretation would enter
             the interpretation into that annex.]
     Weaver: We should propose a format for the ISO document
             to WG5 at the July meeting.
     Martin: John Reid has already sent the 006 to Geneva in
             order to get their reading on the format.
     Hirchert: I have a fax from John Reid containing his
             response from ISO.  I will have it copied and
             put on the table.
     Rolison: Would it be possible to have an updated copy
             of the standard containing all of the edits
             passed thus far.
     Wagener: I have already asked /Edit to look into this
             to see if a document could be produced for the
             July meetings.
     Weaver: The ISO document should contain change pages to
             the standard.
2.4  ISO Report
     Discussion Leader:  Jeanne Martin
     There will be papers on the table regarding defect
             processing and the SC22 procedures for handling
             defect reports.
     The N865 ballot closed on March 12.  Two items failed
             the country vote.  If we want them published
             with this batch, we should be prepare to
             convince WG5 to do so at the July meeting.
     The Informal WG5 Ballot on ISO Varying String Issues
             closes on May 17.
     The ad hoc committee on character handling met and a
             report of that meeting will be included in a
             future WG5 distribution.
     The Guidelines for Writing Bindings to Fortran 90
             document being prepared by the UK will be
             included in the next WG5 distribution.
2.5  Membership/Attendance Report
     Discussion Leader: Maureen Hoffert
     There are currently 30 members, 24 of whom are present
             or represented.
     Four additional members will be in jeopardy of losing
             their membership if they don't attend this
             meeting.
2.6  Approval of Meeting 124 Minutes
     Discussion Leader: Rich Kelble
     Reference: 93-125
     Motion: (Kelble/Whitlock) Approve the minutes of
             meeting 124 as modified by 93-125.
     Action: Passed by unanimous consent.
2.7  Review of the Action Items from Meeting 124
     Reference: Minutes if meeting 124
     1. Andrew Tait:  Make rules about the use of page and
        line numbers in 006.  At meeting 124, a straw vote
        on whether they should appear was (21-0-3), so the
        rules should include the form and location of page
        and line numbers in 006.

        Status:  Pending -- Andrew has ruled that the use of
        page and line numbers is acceptable.  However, no
        rules have been established on the form and location
        of page and line numbers.

     2. Andrew Tait:  Determine a method of identifying new
        items in 006 #0000 for subsequent ballots.

        Status:  Closed -- The edits will be batched into a
        new item on a meeting by meeting basis.

     3. Jerry Wagener discuss with Walt Brainerd:  When we
        get the 006 items back from the WG5 ballot, the
        edits contained in the items which passed should be
        put in document order to help ensure that there are
        no collisions between them.

        Status:  Closed -- Both Jerry and Richard Maine did
        this individually and /edit will be reviewing this
        during their subgroup time.

     4. Jerry Wagener discuss with Andrew Tait:  A subgroup
        field should be added to the 006 items.

        Status:  Pending -- Jerry had recommended to Andrew
        that this not be done, but no ruling has been made.

     5. Andrew Tait:  Provide a ruling on the format of
        titles in the 006 items.

        Status:  Closed -- The initial letter in the first
        word in each title will be capitalized.
2.8  Comments from the Membership
     Wagener: HPFF has requested Ken Kennedy to write us a
             letter asking for user defined elementals.
             Their next meeting is scheduled for January or
             February next year.
     Weaver: The chair of the POSIX Fortran 90 binding  is
             currently recommending that the POSIX Fortran
             90 binding project be canceled.
     Whitlock: [Stan started a discussion regarding the
             appropriateness of some of the recent entries
             in f90-interp.  This discussion lead to the
             suggestion that we invite the users who seem to
             have something to say and who local to our
             meeting locations to our meetings.  For our
             November meeting this would imply 3 speakers.]
     straw:  Are three speakers too many for one meeting?
             (6-10-6)
     several members: It was recommended that the users be
             invited but that the session be held in the
             evening.
     Ellis:  The BSI has published the Fortran standard.
     Maine:  I gave a talk on Fortran 90 at the SHARE
             meeting.
     Philips: What document processing utility will be used
             for the next standard?
     answer: Frame with SGML compatibility.
3    Committee Action Items
3.1  Discussion of Implementation Subgroup
     Discussion Leader: Maureen Hoffert
     References: 92-241, 93-063
     Hoffert: Membership in this subgroup will be open to
             all.  It is an implementation not implementors
             subgroup.  It will consider implementation
             issues as they relate to: (1) future additions
             to Fortran 90, (2) integration of Fortran 90
             and Fortran 77 extensions, and (3) proposal of
             new features to Fortran 90.
     Motion: (Shepherd/Lahey) Adopt 93-241.
     Hendrickson: How will this group find time to operate?
     Shepherd: If a number of people wish to participate in
             both this group and one of the other subgroups,
             the meetings could be held in the evenings or
             over lunch.
     straw:  Are you in favor of this motion? (12-5-8)
     Move to table: (Leonard/Ellis)
     Action: Tabled till Thursday by a vote of (18-1)
3.2  Interpretations
     Discussion Leader: Jerry Wagener
     Wagener: There are 19 interpretations left over from
             the last meeting, 8 to reconsider from our
             ballot, 5 to reconsider from the WG5 ballot,
             and 93-116,118,121,123.
     straw:  We should not automatically pick up
             interpretations requests from f90-interp?  (17-
             0-2)  [Note that this is reaffirming 93-013.]
3.3  Object Oriented Presentation
     Presenter: Ralph E. Johnson
     Reference: 93-141
3.4  X3H5 Fortran 90 Binding Discussion
     Discussion Leader: Rich Bleikamp
     Presenter: Bruce Leasure
     References: X3H5/93-SDA revision 1, Parallel Extensions
             for Fortran (April 2).
     Scribe: David Phillimore.
     Leasure: X3H5 took 4 parts of parallel model and
             produced 3 forms of block structured constructs
             with implicit synchronization.

             a) Parallel construct. (fork/join and data
             allocation)
             b) Grouping construct. (synchronized work)
             c) Worksharing construct. (shared work among
             members of team)

             (then explanation of example code.)

             Shorthand forms exist.
             Explicit synchronization can be done by
             (a) critical sections
             (b) synchronization statements (overloaded on
             type of lock)

             X3H5 will be useful because something similar,
             (different spellings) already on most (all?)
             shared memory machines.

             3rd party vendors would benefit from standard,
             would probably be first to use it. APR & Kuck:
             ship both X3H5-like and HPFF processors. Data
             distribution of HPFF goes with control flow
             parallelism of X3H5. Small amount of overlap.

             Modules and Common: Start of a parallel
             construct often requires some private data (own
             variables?). In complex program, e.g., parallel
             libraries need own variable with respect to
             point of parallel execution.  May want a single
             copy sometimes. Need attribute for programmer
             to describe that a process should get its own
             storage area for Common/Module data, i.e.,
             relocatable Common. Somewhat similar to Task
             Common on Cray.

             Binding: is being rewritten from thick F77-
             flavor binding to thin F90 binding. Comments
             from Parallel subgroup on mark. 1st shot at
             thin binding may be ready be X3J3 Belgium
             meeting. November is target for completion.
             Directive binding is like F77 Appendix (not
             part of standard, but advice)
     Bleikamp: Please elaborate on X3H5 v HPFF.
     Leasure: (references to earlier remarks). HPFF (colon
             notation plus forall) to express parallelism
             doesn't meet all cases (e.g., some SPEC
             benchmarks). where larger granularity required.
             Data parallel and Control flow parallelism are
             compatible.
     Leonard: Please elaborate on X3H5 v Posix Threads.
     Leasure: Another implementation of
             fork/join/synchronization. A C binding exists.
             Good implementation layer - have ported X3H5
             like system on top of Posix threads, existence
             was convenient. It provides shareable data &
             uniform address space. Probably too low level
             for most programmers.
     Leonard: Are there conflicts?
     Leasure: No. Would encourage customers to provide Posix
             threads, - makes port easier.
     Hoffert: ISO recommends F90 bindings via modules.
     Leasure: X3H5 binding activated by USE X3H5. Would like
             to create new statements though.
     Hoffert: Is there much overhead on a serial machine?
     Leasure: No, can be done. May allocate extra storage.
     Weaver: F90 intrinsics RANDOM, RANDOM SEED have side
             effects, what happens in parallel. Would like
             repeatable programs.
     Leasure: RANDOM just one example. SUM is same - may sum
             elements in different (local) order. Parallel
             DO does not specify the order of iterations.
             Roundoff error may affect result.

             Implementations often have two modes - one with
             sequence iterator which runs slower, but
             guarantees order. Similarly for random number
             generators.
     Leonard: May want same seed in each processor. Is that
             possible? Can user control whether a side-
             effect is shared or private?
     Leasure: No, can't do. Parallel/Shared/Private is
             attribute of data at parallel sequence point.
             Need primitive which is 'independent in
             parallel code'.
     Hoffert: HPFF has pure functions - free of side-
             effects. Useful?
     Leasure: X3H5 doesn't worry about side-effects. There
             are basic rules, e.g., two process can't modify
             same thing at same time which programmers have
             to follow. Side effects not special.
     Wagener: Advantage of Group construct is
             synchronization may be avoided by NOWAIT. But
             last processor still has to finish. Is this
             sufficient (and only) reason for the construct?
     Leasure: Yes, only advantage is to reduce overhead.
             Assumption is that synchronization is
             expensive.
     Whitlock: Does synchronization occur only at end of
             Worksharing construct?
     Leasure: Three places. End of Parallel construct, end
             of Worksharing construct, end of Group
             construct.
     Weaver: Is each statement in a Worksharing construct
             independent?
     Leasure: No, they are independent groups of statements,
             e.g., distinct Parallel Dos can't use arbitrary
             globals.
     Weaver: Does Parallel Section still exist?
     Leasure: Yes, like Parallel case. Just not in example.
     Mattoon/Leasure: Discussion of details in example...
     Levine: It seems Group could be done, with Parallel
             loops and nested parallel sections.
     Leasure: Will discuss afterwards.
     Bleikamp: 3 Straw votes.
         straw:     Should X3H5 avoid all examples which
                    could be done more simply in Fortran 90?
                    (5-12-8)
         straw:     Are you in favor of parallel scoping
                    along the lines that X3H5 has
                    introduced?  (9-7-9)
         straw:     Are you in favor of different
                    instantiations of modules and common?

3.5  Interpretations Processing -- May 12
     Wagener: Are there any objections to continuing the
             practice started at the last meeting of using a
             majority vote to move an interpretation to the
             letter ballot?  Hearing none, the practice will
             stand.

                    status of 3a (Fortran 95 requirement),
                    3b (Fortran 2000 requirement), or are
                    you undecided? (9-13-1)
         Leonard:   The C++ committee has been working for 2
                    years on this issue --- it is not yet
                    finished.  We can't do better.  If
                    attempted, we will be unable to complete
                    in 1995 and waste effort.  Better to do
                    it in 2000.
         Shepherd:  Not in favor of this generality.  Would
                    like exception handling restricted to
                    call site, as it will help optimization.
         Ellis:     Prefer recommending to WG5 that it be
                    considered for Fortran 95 and if it
                    can't be done defer it to 2000.
         Hirchert:  There is no way it can be done right by
                    1995.  It would be silly for X3J3 to
                    recommend it to WG5 and then reported
                    later that it can't do it.
         Action:    Passed by a vote of (20-2).
     Item 13
         Motion:    (Whitlock/Philips) Move 93-004r.013 to
                    status 3a (forward to WG5 as a
                    requirement for Fortran 95).
         Lahey:     Came up in OOF.  OOF will be able to
                    initialize entities.  Make sure there is
                    no conflict downstream.
         Leonard:   Favors problem being fixed that it
                    attempts to fix, but prefers a
                    constructor/destructor method.  Mistake
                    to do both.  Add to object oriented
                    requirement.  Otherwise may be a
                    conflict.
         Bierman:   Users can take optional action when
                    instantiating an object.  Can implement
                    just part of object oriented.  Don't
                    propose a specific solution.
         Ellis:     It will certainly be brought up by
                    several WG5 members.
         Bierman:   Having a compiler always initializing a
                    pointer is expensive.
         straw:     Do you wish to forward 93-004r.013 to
                    WG5 (status 3), change it to status
                    archival (status 6), or are you
                    undecided? (7-8-10)
         Action:    Withdrawn.
     Item 14
         straw:     Do you wish to move 93-004r.014 to
                    status 3 (forward to WG5), change it to
                    status 6 (archival), or are you
                    undecided? (9-3-8)
         Action:    None -- it keeps the current status.
     Item 15
         Bierman:   Very convenient.  ANSI C put it into
                    language.  Should be a separate
                    standard.
         Lahey:     Implemented but not used.
         Bierman:   C version heavily used for Fortran.
         Martin:    HPF would like this.  Allows directives
                    for different processes
         Leonard:   HPF would be satisfied by a separate
                    standard.
         Shepherd:  Important to have.  Urgent, because
                    otherwise there will be more and more
                    use of CPP, which is not addressed to
                    Fortran.
         Kelble:    WG5 could do it as a separate standard.
         Motion:    (Whitlock/Philips) Move 93-004r.015 to
                    status 3b (forward to WG5 as a
                    requirement for Fortran 2000).
         Action:    Failed by a vote of (12-11).
         Motion:    (Whitlock/Philips) Move 93-004r.015 to
                    status 3a (forward to WG5 as a
                    requirement for Fortran 95).
         Action:    Passed by a vote of (18-6).
     Item 16
         Motion:    (Whitlock/Philips) Move 93-004r.016 to
                    status 3b (forward to WG5 as a
                    requirement for Fortran 2000).
         Bierman:   Is it not in POSIX and done well?
         Lahey:     I would like to see it in 95
         Leonard:   Don't want to add something that would
                    conflict with POSIX.  Requirement should
                    state that interoperability with POSIX
                    is necessary.
         Mattoon:   Will refer it to POSIX.
         Action:    Failed by a vote of (11-12).
         Shepherd:  Fix AIX reference.
         Motion:    (Whitlock/Philips) Move 93-004r.015 to
                    status 3a (forward to WG5 as a
                    requirement for Fortran 95).
         Action:    Passed by a vote of (21-1).
     Item 17
         Motion:    (Whitlock/Philips) Move 93-004r.017 to
                    status 3b (forward to WG5 as a
                    requirement for Fortran 2000).
         Katz:      Number one on DOD list
         Shepherd:  Contradictory justification.  Move
                    status to 2 to  refine.
         Warnock:   One of the two things needed in Fortran
                    90.
         Action:    Passed by a vote of (22-2).
     Item 18

                    requirement for Fortran 95).
         Action:    Failed by a vote of (14-8).
         Motion:    (Whitlock/Philips) Move 93-004r.018 to

             will be available on the FTP server hopefully
             within the next few weeks.
3.12 JOR Subgroup Report -- session 2
     Discussion Leader: Stan Whitlock
     Scribe: Ivor Philips
     Whitlock asked that the following papers proposed for
             inclusion in the JOR be briefly introduced by
             the proposer.
     X3J3/93-167 Nested Where
             Desired by HPF. Useful since their parallelism
             only from arrays, not from loops.
     X3J3/93-168 "User Defined Intrinsic Functions"
             Title in quotes because it may be modified.
             Most user functions can be the ordinary
             external functions. However, some functions
             must be known to the compiler such as a
             function the compiler calls to get the number
             of processors to define an array dimension.
     X3J3/93-169 Pure User Functions and Subroutines.
             Useful in FORALL since it is specified by the
             user that the function or subroutine has no
             side-effects. This addresses the same issues
             (but in a different way) as paper 163 - User
             defined elementals.
     X3J3/93-170 Packaging implementor specific intrinsics
             in MODULEs
             Provides a way to control name space pollution
             while still making available intrinsics from
             vendors or other standard bodies. Would provide
             an answer to interpretation 122
     X3J3/93-171 Directives
             No explanation needed.
     X3J3/93-120 Object Oriented Fortran OOF
             Kurt has provided an email group for those
             interested in OOF. This topic was discussed in
             more detail in the OOF report.
     X3J3/93-164 Variant Derived Types (non-tag version)
             Suggest keyword be spelled UNION since many
             vendors already have identical or similar UNION
             construct. Non-tag version would have less
             overhead. In many useful situations, tag may
             not be known at compile time. In fact, the tag
             may not be a part of the data, but merely
             implied by which routine processes the data.
             While some believe that OOF and classes with
             inheritance could solve this problem, it is not
             clear that this entirely replaces UNION
             functionality.

             Can you union more than two objects--example
             shows only two? Only one equivalence is shown
             because there is currently no nesting of
             derived types. But you can get same effect by
             creating a derived type for the data you wish
             equivalenced.

             I/O for these variant derived types could be
             "messy." Perhaps I/O for those fields would be
             prohibited.

             Some feeling is that this is reintroducing the
             idea of equivalence that people want to get
             away from.

             Garbage collection may be impossible with this
             proposal if pointers are being equivalenced.
             But garbage collection is difficult in Fortran
             in general.

4.2  Future Meetings
     See section 7 of these minutes.
4.3  Agenda of Meeting 126
     Discussion: An initial discussion of the agenda was
             held.  All further suggestions should be sent
             to Maureen.
4.4  Treasurer's Report
     The treasurer's report will be available at the next
             meeting.
4.5  Action Items Review
     1. Andrew Tait:  Make rules about the use of page and
        line numbers in 006.  At meeting 124, a straw vote
        on whether they should appear was (21-0-3), so the
        rules should include the form and location of page
        and line numbers in 006.

        Status:  Pending -- Andrew has ruled that the use of
        page and line numbers is acceptable.  However, no
        rules have been established on the form and location
        of page and line numbers.

     2. Jerry Wagener discuss with Andrew Tait:  A subgroup
        field should be added to the 006 items.

        Status:  Pending -- Jerry had recommended to Andrew
        that this not be done, but no ruling has been made.

     3. Andrew Tait::  Make a ruling on the format of
        standard citations in the 006.  Currently, some are
        enclosed in quotation marks and some are indented.

        Status:  New
4.6  Comments from Members
     Wagener: We need a volunteer to take the position of
             secretary.  If you are interested, please
             contact me.
     Wagener: I would like to give my thanks to Kurt for
             hosting this meeting.
