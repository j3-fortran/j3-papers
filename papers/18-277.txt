Subject: Put with notify
Date: 2018-October-17



I Introduction

A capability called "put with notify" is popular in the SHMEM
community as a very efficient, narrowly focused, synchronization
technique for data transfers between images. The basic idea is to
combine a "put" (definition of a variable on a different image) with a
notification mechanism that allows the receiving image to know that
the data has arrived.  While long requested for coarrays in Fortran,
there was previously no simple syntax to allow for two things (the put
and the notify) on the left side of an assignment.  

Fortran 2018 introduced specifiers as part of an image selector. The 
addition of a notify-specifier to an image selector, and a NOTIFY WAIT
statement could solve this problem. For example,

    x[10, NOTIFY=nx] = y

where nx is a coarray declared of type(NOTIFY_TYPE).  The NOTIFY_TYPE
is defined in the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV and has properties
similar to type EVENT_TYPE.

The effective notify operation is to the nx variable on the same image
as specified by the image selector.  On image 10,

    NOTIFY WAIT (nx)
    [here it is safe to reference x and get the new value]


II Use-cases
 
It is common for an image, i, to wait until another image, j, has 
updated a coarray on image i before image i continues execution. This
can currently be implemented using locks.  For example,

!   On some image other than 10
    x[10] = y
    POST EVENT (nx [10])

!  On image 10
    EVENT WAIT (nx)
    z = x

It could be implmented more efficiently using a put with notify 
mechanism:

!  On some image other than 10
   x[10, NOTIFY=nx] = y

! On image 10
   WAIT NOTIFY (nx)
   z = x

The put with notify version differs from the EVENT version in that the
notify can be incorporated into the same data packet as the value of y. 
Also the synchronization is only on this particular transfer, and not
all outstanding memory operations on this image.  The put with 
notify operation does not constitute segment ordering, and the NOTIFY 
WAIT statement is not an image control statement.  The notify variable
semantics are like those of atomic operations with regard to segment
ordering.

If x is an array "waiting" for data to be transferred to separate
elements from one or more imaages, the NOTIFY WAIT could have an
optional UNTIL_COUNT= clause similar to EVENT WAIT.

! On images other than image 10
  x(i)[10, NOTIFY=nx] = y

! On image 10
  NOTIFY WAIT (nx, UNTIL_COUNT=size(x))
  z(:) = x(:)


III Requirements

A new type NOTIFY_TYPE, similar to EVENT_TYPE would be defined in the
intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.  Like an EVENT_TYPE, it would have 
an integer count component which is atomically incremented. Variables
of type NOTIFY_TYPE would be coarrays.

A NOTIFY= specifier would be added to an image selector.  This form of
image selector is allowed only as part of the designator for the
variable of an assignment statement.  The effective notify operation
is to the nx variable on the same image as specified by the image
selector. A notify operation atomically increments the notify variable
count on the specified image by one. A notify operation does not
constitute segment ordering.

A NOTIFY WAIT statement with syntax similar to an EVENT WAIT statement
would be added with an optional UNTIL_COUNT= specifier. Successful
execution of a NOTIFY WAIT statement decrements the count of the 
notify variable by one, or by the specified UNTIL_COUNT= count, if 
specified.  An NOTIFY WAIT statement would have optional STAT= and 
ERRMSG= specifiers with the semantics of those on and EVENT WAIT 
statement. A NOTIFY WAIT statement is not an image control statement.
