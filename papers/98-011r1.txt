Subject:     Editor's list of unresolved issues.

This paper is a list of issues that the editor considers to be
unresolved.  Items may be deleted from this list when they are
resolved, but the item numbers will not be re-used.  Items in this
list may have associated J3 internal notes in the document, though
currently many do not.  When there is a corresponding J3 note,
the J3 note shall reference the item number.

Thr first version of this document included the text of the J3
notes.  Following suggestions from the floor, this version has
been shortened by deleting all the text detailing the issues.
That text remains in the J3 note, which is referenced herein.

For those cases where there is not yet a corresponding J3 note
in the document, or where the note does not include all of the
relevant material, the detailed text remains here for now, with
the intent that this text will later be moved into a J3 note
(unless the issue is resolved first).

1. Time dependent attributes
   Needs J3 note in 9.4.1.10.
   Raised in 98-110.  About 97-262.

  In 9.4.1.10, I really don't like the change from "Any variable that"
  to "When a variable".  The "when" phraseology implies that the
  attribute is time-dependent, which is not a concept that we have at
  all.  I can buy that it is time-dependent whether a a variable is a
  pending I/O storage affector.  But I don't buy any attributes
  (including ASYNCHRONOUS) being time-dependent.  They are at most
  scoping unit dependent.  Though I don't like this, I did leave it
  alone, as it was a J3-voted change to my previous wording.  (I'm ok
  with the other changes).  See below for more on this.

2. More on time dependent attributes.
   Needs a J3 note in 5.1.2.12.
   Raised in 98-110 item 1.  About 97-262.

  I find the wording in the first para of 5.1.2.12 a bit confusing.
  It mixes static and time-dependent concepts, and I think parts of it
  are redundant.  If you are keying off the fact that the variable is
  only an affector while a data transfer statement that references its
  storage units is pending, then it is redundant to also have the
  condition that a data transfer statement be pending - if the
  variable is currently an effector, then one must be.  I think the
  biggest thing here is to more clearly delineate static from
  time-dependent conditions.  My proposed wording is:

      "The base object of variable shall have the
       <<ASYNCHRONOUS attribute>> in a scoping unit if
        (1) the variable appears in an executable statement or
            specification expression in that scoping unit and
            ["in an expression or executable statement"?  your choice]
        (2) any statement of the scoping unit is executed while
            the variable is a pending I/O storage sequence
            effector (9.4.1.10)"

  The biggest point of this wording is that the pending I/O storage
  sequence effector stuff is mentioned in a time context (with
  "while"), but the static characteristics are outside of any
  time-dependent conditional phrases.

  Since there have been a few revisions in this wording already, I
  have *NOT* made this change just on my own, but I commend it to J3's
  (and JOR's) attention for the next revision.

3. I/O error handling.
   Needs J3 note in 9.4.4.
   Raised in 98-110 item 3.  About 97-262.

  I don't really think you want to say in 9.4.4(3) that "execution of
  the current data transfer statement is terminated."  Setting the
  value of the IOSTAT variable is specifically identified by the last
  item in this list as part of the execution of a data transfer
  statement.  I don't think you want that skipped.  (Hmm, now that I
  think of such things, why isn't there a subsequent item for possible
  transfer of control to statements identified by end=, err=, or eor=
  specifiers?  That also seems like part of the execution of the
  statement to me).  You probably just want to say that steps 4-8 are
  skipped.  Hmm.  Still thinking of such things, it seems like the
  description of error handling is all messed up here.  We only
  consider errors in one place (the old item 6, new 7)?  What if an
  error occurs in the next step (position file after data transfer)?
  We ignore that?  Or what if one occurs much earlier - say in
  identifying the unit?  We still do file positioning and data
  transfer even when we don't have a unit?  (I suppose you could
  conceptually say that we still do all these things, but that they
  all fail because of the error condition).  I'm going to leave this
  for the J3 or JOR to work on because there can well be real semantic
  content to some of these questions (example - questions of whether
  variables in the i/o list become undefined if we have skipped the
  step of transferring the data as opposed to having an error in it).

4. Pending I/O storage sequence affector.
   Unnumbered J3 note in 9.4.1.10 of 98-007r3.
   Raised in 98-110 item 4.  About 97-262.

5. Direct and ultimate components.
   Unnumbered J3 note in 4.5.0 of 98-007r3.
   Raised in 98-110 item 6.  About N1282.

6. Allocatable components and subobjects.
   Unnumbered J3 note in 6.1.2 of 98-007r3.
   Raised in 98-110 item 7.  About N1282.

7. Automatic deallocation
   Unnumbered J3 note in 6.3.1.2.
   Raised in 98-110 item 8.  About N1282.

8. Output of allocatable components.
   Needs J3 note in 9.4.2.
   Raisef in 98-110 item 9.  About N1282.

  [149:6]  It isn't clear to me that there is any real problem with
  allocatable components in output list items.  This isn't like
  the case of pointers where the pointer inherently looses its semantics
  when written to a file.  For formatted input I can see that there
  would be ambiguities, but I see no problem in formatted output or
  in unformatted i/o.  This is clearly more than an editorial matter.
  There is also obviously nothing wrong with disallowing it.
  I just commend it to J3's attention as a possible extension as
  part of the f2k integration.

9. Initialization of objects with allocatable components.
   Needs J3 note.
   Raised in 98-110 item 10.  About N1282

  As a possible f2k integration enhancement, I suggest
  we consider allowing initialization of an object of a derived type
  that has a component that is an allocatable array?  At least allow
  it to be initialized to null()?  This one may have subtleties that I
  don't yet appreciate.  It seems odd that we can initialize something
  with a pointer component, but not something with an allocatable
  component.  Ok, so its redundant because it is implicit anyway.  Why
  not allow it to be explicit?  Are there reasons other than the
  apparent redundancy for disallowing it?  The restriction as currently
  stated disallow things that are not redundant, like initialization
  of objects of derived type that happen to have an allocatable
  component.  This is clearly not an editorial issue.  I commend it
  to J3's attention as a possible enhancement to add during
  integration.

  Related issues include allowing ALLOCATABLE components in
  parameters.

10. Pointer and allocatable parameters.
    Needs J3 note.
    Raised in 98-110 item 11.  About N1282.

  This isn't directly related to the TR, but came up while I was
  studying the DTR (and wondering why we couldn't allow PARAMETERS
  with the allocatable attribute as mentioned above).
  I suggest we consider allowing pointers with the parameter
  attribute.  Yes, the only possible value is NULL(), but that happens
  to be useful.  For example, you might want to pass it as an actual
  arg for an intent(in) dummy pointer.  Note that we do allow
  parameters with pointer components (note 5.8 even has an explicit
  example in case anyone has any question), so lets allow the simpler
  case also.  I might argue that this is appropriate as an integration
  issue for intent for pointer dummy args.  A pointer parameter is
  much like an intent(in) argument.

11. Execution of a process
    Needs a J3 note in 15.2.
    Raised in 98-110 item 12.  About N1281.

  I don't like the usage of the terminology "execution of a process"
  in the paragraphs after the new note 15.1.  It seems vague (what
  process?)  and we don't have any technical definition for what "a
  process" means anyway.  But I didn't do anything about it.  In the
  same area, I also question the terminology "a process further to
  those required or permitted by the standard."  Among other things,
  it sounds almost circular - doesn't it essentially say that if the
  standard prohibits something, then that something shall not happen?
  Maybe the interval folk could look at this.  Sounds very simillar
  to some of the questions they raised about when optimization is
  legal, and how to specify such things.

12. IEEE_SUPPORT_HALTING
    Needs J3 note in 15.9.25.
    Raised in 98-110 item 13.  About N1281.

  Shouldn't 15.9.25 be more specific in that it should inquire whether
  halting can be controlled by IEEE_SET_HALTING_MODE, rather than just
  whether there is some unspecified means of controlling it (like
  a vendor-specific intrinsic, some of which *DO* currently exist,
  so this is not just academic)?  Also, shouldn't IEEE_SET_HALTING_MODE
  have some reference to whether this capability is supported or not?
  What happens if you call IEEE_SET_HALTING_MODE when setting the halting
  mode isn't defined?  Perhaps the INTRINSIC doesn't exist in such a
  case; perhaps it does nothing; perhaps it sets some exception?  I don't
  see any mention of this obvious error condition.  Well, I guess it
  does say under IEEE_SET_HALTING_MODE that "the processor must/shall
  either already be treating this exception this way or be capable of
  changing the mode so that it does."  I suppose that means it is just
  illegal code to call it if you don't know that the processor can do
  it.  But how do you know that?  Presumably from IEEE_SUPPORT_HALTING,
  but I don't see the connection made explicit.  Probably simillar
  questions for what happens when you call other "unsupported" things.
  I haven't taken the time to make a full list.

13. Initial definition status of INTENT(OUT) dummies
    Needs J3 note in 14.7.5(6).
    Raised in 98-110 item 14.

  While perusing other things, I noticed that 14.7.5(6) is wrong
  for INTENT(OUT) arguments.  I didn't take the time to fix it
  or to check for simillar problems elsewhere.

14. Restrictions on dummy pointers and allocatables not present.
    Needs J3 note in 12.4.1.6.
    Raised in 98-110 item 15.

  Section 12.4.1.6 seems to miss several restrictions on pointer
  optional dummy arguments that are not present.  For example, they
  should not be allocated, deallocated, pointer dereferenced (which
  might not always constitute a reference), pointer assigned, or
  nullified.  There might also be simillar omissions for
  allocatable optional dummies.

15. Explain constraint on proc pointers.
    First unnumbered J3 note in 5.2
    Raised in 98-144.  About 98-121r1.

  (Not all of this explanation yet in the J3 note)
  The 2nd constraint after R523 needs explanation.
  Its also not clear that it is right.  Suggestion that
  accessibility should not be prohibitted.

16. Procedure declaration stmt
    Second and 3rd unnumbered J3 notes in 5.2.
    Raised in 98-144.  About 98-121r1.

  (Following extra material still needs to be added to the J3 note).
  Hmm.  For that matter, I don't see anything outside of the note 5.20
  that explains what "procedure ()" means at all.  Nor do I see anything
  that explicitly says that "procedure (real)" means an implicit
  interface real function, or that "procedure (some_interface)"
  means a procedure with that interface.  We just have the syntax,
  but we are missing words to say what the syntax means.  Some of
  the cases are fairly obvious, but others are not.  Even for the
  obvious cases, we should say the words instead of hoping that it
  is equally obvious to everyone.  The only words I see have to do
  with whether the entity is a procedure pointer, dummy procedure,
  or external procedure.  But I don't see any words about the interface
  being given to the specified names.

17. Parent type component.
    First unnumbered J3 note in 4.5.3.
    Raised in 98-168.  About 98-145r2.

18. Component name conflicts.
    Second unnumbered J3 note in 4.5.3.
    Raised in 98-168.  About 98-145r2.

19. Component or subobject.
    Unnumbered J3 note in 4.5.6.
    Raised in 98-168.  About 98-145r2.

20. Constraints on polymorphic pointer assignment
    Unnumbered J3 note in 7.5.2
    Raised in 98-168.  About 98-145r2.

  (Following extra material still needs to be added to the J3 note).
  Also, I'm surprised that there are no compile-time constraints at all
  on type when target is polymorphic.  We don't even demand compile-time
  checking that the target and pointer have the same base type.

  As a general problem in several places I'm concerned about the
  integration of pdts with inheritance.  Looks to me like we didn't
  catch nearly all of the areas.  I think that to integrate them
  properly, we are going to have to talk about "type and type
  parameters" together, rather than writing one set of requirements
  about types and then a separate set of requirements about the type
  parameters.

  It has been suggested elsewhere that we come up with terms to
  describe "type and type parameters" or "type and kind type
  parameters".  It might simplify wording some of these things.
  Perhaps we might just suitably modify the definitions of declared
  type and dynamic type.  We may need to modify them a little anyway.
  I don't think we ever quite explicitly said that the declared
  type of a non-polymorphic object type means (though its fairly
  obvious).

21. Scope of component names.
    Unnumbered J3 note in 14.1.2.5
    Raised in 98-168.  About 98-153.

  (Following extra material still needs to be added to the J3 note).
  On studying 14.0, 14.1.2, 14.1.2.5, and 14.1.3, it seems to me that
  components and type parameters are better described as having a
  scope of the derived type definition instead of saying that they
  have "the same scope as the derived type".  I'd then interpret parts
  of section 14.1.2.5 as describing (quite adequately, I think) the
  limited contexts in which these names can be used outside of the
  derived type definition (that is, outside of their scope).

  In fact, I think we are forced to do type parameters this way
  because we need to have them included in the list (14.6.1.3) of
  things that block host association of host entities of the same
  name.  The edits of paper 98-153 added type parameters to that list,
  but that only makes sense if type parameters have a scope of the
  derived type definition.  So I've redescribed the scope of type
  parameters in that manner.  If I've messed this up, let me know.


22. IEEE_SUPPORT intrinsics.
    Needs J3 note in 15.?
    Raised at meeting 146.  About N1281.

  The IEEE_SUPPORT_* intrinsics in c15 appear to be impossible
  to use portably.  As I interpret them, it is illegal to
  even write the call in the source code unless the data type
  returns true from IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE, which you don't
  know until runtime.  It doesn't look to me like protecting
  these calls with a conditional would make them legal - they
  might fail compilation.

  For the IEEE_SUPPORT_* calls, I'd think it obvious to allow
  them for all real kinds.  There is an obvious value for them
  to return (.false.).  Simillar issues with the other IEEE
  intrinsics, though for many of them, the value to return
  isn't obvious.  Perhaps they should still be legal to write,
  but not to invoke (so that they can be protected by
  conditionals).
