I Introduction

At meeting 219, during the roll call of features, the rank-1
integer as array descriptor feature was supported.  I asked a question
of whether a distinct type for the array descriptor would be
a more advantageous approach.  The answer was that it
should be considered, but had not yet been.  This paper
attempts to further the discussions started in 19-150.



II Basic Idea

A new derived type is added to iso_fortran_env that performs the functions
of the rank-1 integer array descriptor.  This can reduce the new syntax
required to provide useful array bounds and subscript description.

While the meaning and use of a rank-1 integer are well established,
a new type may be given any desirable behavior.

This paper proposes the following: 

1. A new derived type is added to iso_fortran_env, called
   "array_spec_type".

2. An object of array_spec_type is initialized by value constructor.
   An object of array_spec_type is set by value constructor.

3. An object of array_spec_type has two visible data components;
   these are lb and ub, each of which are rank-1 integer arrays.
    [Note: These are intentionally not declared to be protected
           to allow example <n> below]
   An object of array_spec_type has two type-bound procedures;
   these are ordinal() and element() and are non-overrideable.


4. Type-bound procedures ordinal() and element() are supplied to
   convert from subscripts to storage ordinal and from 
   storage ordinal to subscripts.

5. An object of array_spec_type can be used within a DIMENSION statement.

6. The array_spec_type can be extended.

7 An object of array_spec_type can be a component of another type,
   can be declared as an array, can be a dummy argument (including being
   used for generic resolution).

8 An object of array_spec_type cannot be in COMMON or EQUIVALENCE.

9 When an allocatable object is used as the mold for an object of
  array_spec_type, the allocatable shall be allocated.

  When a pointer object is used as the mold for an object of
  array_spec_type, the pointer shall be associated.


III Examples of array_spec_type objects in declarations

Given that all the declaration examples share these lines:

! ensure this is the "real" array_spec_type

use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only: array_spec_type

type(any-type), dimension(42) :: foo

! Declaration example 1:
! declare an array_spec_type object and associate it with an array

type( array_spec_type) :: asto = array_spec_type( foo )

! Declaration example 2:
! allocate goo the same bounds as foo

type(any-other-type), dimension( asto) :: goo ! same bounds as foo

! Declaration example 3:
! add a halo of ghost elements

type(any-other-type), dimension( asto% lb - 1: asto% ub + 1) :: poo


IV Examples of array_spec_type objects in executables

Executable example 1:
! translate subscripts from one rank to another

type(any-type), dimension( 10,10), target :: a

type(same-as-a), dimension( :, :, :), pointer :: pa

type(array_spec_type) :: asta = array_spec_type(a)

! astpa is declared, but is initially undefined 
type(array_spec_type)  astpa

! Before pa is assigned, its dimension information is undefined.
!  Setting astpa here will also be undefined

astpa = array_spec_type(pa)

pa(1:5,1:5,1:4) => a

! After pa is assigned, setting astpa will give
!   astpa%lb=[ 1, 1, 1 ]
!   astpa%ub=[ 5, 5, 4 ]
astpa = array_spec_type(pa)


Executable example 2:
! Find the ordinal of an element in one array, and access that
!  same relative element in another, potentially different-shaped
!  array.

type(same-any-type), dimension( n, m)     :: a

type(same-any-type), dimension( i, j, k) :: b

type(array_spec_type) :: asta = array_spec_type(a)
type(array_spec_type) :: astb = array_spec_type(b)

integer o
type(same-any-type) ofinterest


! find the ordinal of an element in array a

o = asta% ordinal( minloc(a))

! and access the same element in array b

ofinterest = b( astb%element(o) )



Executable example 3:
! Use the array_spec_type in allocation
subroutine testme (scratch)
use, intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only: array_spec_type

type(any-type), dimension(42) :: foo

type( array_spec_type) :: asto = array_spec_type( foo )

type( ...), dimension(..), allocatable :: scratch

! allocate scratch to have the same bounds as foo

allocate( scratch( asto))  !! Yes, same results as mold=foo

Executable example 4:
! SWAP from 19-152r1, using ast

#define SWAP_USING_AST(A,B) \
    ASSOCIATE(x=>A,y=>B); \ ! associations to avoid naming issues
        BLOCK; \
            REAL, DIMENSION(array_spec_type(x)) :: temp; \
            temp = x; \
            x = y; \
            y = temp; \
        END BLOCK; \
    END ASSOCIATE
