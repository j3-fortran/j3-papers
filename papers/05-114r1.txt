Here is a draft response for F03/0035, with thanks to Malcolm Cohen
for his help.

NUMBER:  F03/0035
TITLE:  IEEE_NEXT_AFTER()
KEYWORDS: IEEE-754, nextafter()
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation 
STATUS: For consideration

QUESTION:

What is NEXT_AFTER(+0.0,-0.0)?  NEXT_AFTER(-0.0,+0.0)?

What is NEXT_AFTER(X,Y) if X and/or Y is NaN?

C99 and IEEE-754R (the revision of IEEE-754 now in progress)
define NEXT_AFTER(X,Y) as Y (not X) when X == Y.

NEXT_AFTER(X,Y) when both X and Y are NaN shall be a NaN, and
should be one of NaN arguments.

NEXT_AFTER(X,Y) when one of X and Y is a NaN shall be a NaN, and
should the NaN argument.

ANSWER:

The first paragraph of 14.8 states "Complete conformance with the 
is not required, but ... the functions copysign, scalb, logb, 
nextafter, rem, and unordered shall be provided by the functions 
IEEE_COPY_SIGN, IEEE_SCALB, IEEE_LOGB, IEEE_NEXT_AFTER, IEEE_REM, 
and IEEE_UNORDERED."

For NEXT_AFTER(X,Y) with X == Y == 0, the result is X, see 14.10.13, 
Case (i). This is the recommendation of the IEEE International 
Standard. The current draft revision of that Standard uses the 
definition copysign(x,y) in this case. We will reconsider the Fortran 
definition of NEXT_AFTER if a revised IEEE Standard is adopted
with this change present.

The case of NEXT_AFTER(X,Y) when one or both of X and Y is a NaN
is as defined by the IEEE International Standard, see the words 
from 14.8 quoted above. 

EDITS: None.
