1. Introduction

This paper collects the editorial suggestions made in papers 09-172,
09-177, 09-180 and 09-182.  Edits made in those papers that do not appear
here have been rejected.  Additional edits have been added to fix other
glitches more recently spotted.


2. Edits

[xiv:p3-2:-1] Change "a missing" to "an absent nonallocatable".

[5:33] 1.3.24 codimension
  Before "corresponding" insert "a set of",
  Delete refs "(R624, 6.6)".
{Clarify wording.  The references were wrong: those refs are for image
 selectors, not for "codimension".  No ref is needed because it describes
 codimension by reference to "coarray" and that has a reference to 2.4.7
 which is where this setup is described.}

[5:36] 1.3.25 coindexed object
  Append refs "(R624, 6.6)".
{This is where those refs belonged.}

[37:12] 2.4.7p4
  "<cosubscript>s" -> "cosubscripts".
{Nothing else in this subclause uses the syntax terms, and neither should
 this.}

[37:14,15] 2.4.7p5
  Delete "noncoarray",
  After "or pointer" insert "component".
{A coarray is not permitted to have a coarray subcomponent anyway; and
 there is no such thing as pointer selection.}

[55:29] 4.4.2.4p1
  Reinstate "real part" and "imaginary part" in the text (right now they
  are only in the index).

[89:20] 5.3.1 C515
  Change
    "function result that does not have the ALLOCATABLE or POINTER
     attribute"
  to
    "nonallocatable nonpointer function result".
{Simplify wording.}

[91:22+3] After "same image" insert "as the pointer".

[92:18] 5.3.6.3 C528
  Change "coarray that does not have the ALLOCATABLE attribute"
  to     "nonallocatable coarray".
{Simplify wording.}

[119:12] 6.2.1 heading
  Delete heading.
{Spurious remainder of past structure.}

[127:18] "specifies" -> "determines",
         "coarray data" -> "a coindexed object".
{It determines what the image index is, it is not a specification.
 And it's the image index for accessing a coindexed object or maybe for
 accessing a coarray.}

[130:22] After "conformable" delete "(2.4.6)".
{It's a defined term and needs no cross-reference.}

[155:14] Hyperlink "conform" to "conformable", or better still,
  Change "the shapes of the variable and <expr> shall conform"
  to     "the variable and <expr> shall be conformable".

[155:23] After "corresponding kind" insert "type parameter".

[189:26,27] Delete "END or RETURN ... ;" (one line),
  Delete "completes execution of a block (8.1.2.2) and"
  After "results in" insert "the",
  Turning those two items into
    "- any statement that results in the implicit deallocation of a
       coarray;"
{Combine two cases into the obvious one case, fix grammar.  Note this was
 already edited by 09-216.}

[304:13]
  Change "assignmentstatement" to "assignment statement".

[518:36-37] C.10.1p2, replace entire misleading paragraph with
  "In the following example, the COINDEX function calculates the image
   index from the cobounds plus a list of subscripts, and the COSUBSCRIPTS
   function calculates a set of cosubscripts that specify a given image
   index."
{These are not anything like the intrinsics!}

[518:38-519:23] In the example, make the following renamings:
  name of module "index" -> "coindex_module",
  "image_index" -> "coindex",
  "lbound" -> "lcobound" (in both functions),
  "ubound" -> "ucobound" (ditto),
  "this_image" -> "cosubscripts",
  "me" -> "image_number".
{The interfaces of the example functions are totally unlike the intrinsics
 earlier mentioned, blowing the intrinsics away (and the intrinsic INDEX)
 with misleading function names is a bit much.
 In c13 we say these functions "are similar" but to me they look more like
 "not entirely dissimilar".}

[535:Annex title]
  After "(Informative)
         Syntax rules"
  Append "and constraints".

[535:D.1 title] Append "and constraints".
