Subject:  Edits from corrigendum 1 applied to F2k

These are the edits needed to apply edits from Corrigendum 1 to the 007/R1
version of F2k.   Each edit from Corrigendum 1 has been broken out into a
separate chunk with the appropriate action marked by
	F2K
In many cases the edits have already been applied and the updated text in
007/R1 is indicated.

The header at the start of each group gives F95 page and line numbers and
the number(s) of the interpretation that generated the edits.

45:17+  Add a note
NOTE 4.17.5
"A type-param-name is not an object.  Therefore it is permissible for a
bound in an explicit-shape-spec, or a type-param-value, to contain a reference
to a type-param-name."
