1. Introduction
===============

21-169r1 revisions: M2 is modified to allow pointer results from a
function. There are uses for such results which wouldn't necessarily leak
memory, such as non-unique pointers or passing to a procedure in the module
which defined the protected type, thus there's no need to prohibit them
entirely. S and T are modified to refer to any unprotected polymorphic
pointer, not just unlimited polymorphic pointers. O is reworded for
clarification.

NOTE: This paper is the successor to 21-164. It incorporates the results of
the straw votes; the name is changed to PROTECTED. It also incorporates
feedback from discussion; clarifying comments are added. Finally,
components of a protected type are given the protected attribute by
default.

This paper contains the formal specifications & syntax for protected types.
This supersedes the specifications outlined by previous papers, as subgroup
discussion revealed a more flexible feature set was needed to meet
competing user requirements.

Previous protected-components specifications fell into one of two camps.
Papers 18-265 and 20-106 envisioned components inaccessible for *direct*
modification outside the module in which the parent type was defined, but
did allow a type containing a protected potential subobject to appear in a
variable-definition context. These papers propose an access specifier
roughly in-between PUBLIC and PRIVATE, by effectively prohibiting the name
of a protected component from appearing in a variable-definition context,
not protecting the variable itself. Other papers, 19-135r1, 19-161,
19-214r1, and 20-121 offered stronger protection, protecting variables
themselves from being modified by virtually any means outside the module
where that component was defined.

This paper--and its partner paper--aims to satisfy both parties by teasing
apart the competing goals into two separate features: protected components,
and protected types. Protected components provide an access specification
allowing code outside the module defining the type to read, but not
*directly* modify components. These components will not impose any
restrictions on the type containing them, beyond anything that might be
imposed by the analogous PRIVATE or PUBLIC access specifiers. Protected
types may be used to protect the data from appearing in variable-definition
contexts.

Although this is a formal syntax paper, the syntax will be defined by prose
and by example, not by BNF, to aid comprehension.


2. Use Cases
============

Use cases have been presented previously. Here is a summary; for more,
refer to 19-135r1.

Type restriction disables intrinsic assignment, allocation, deallocation,
and finalization outside the module where that type is defined. It does not
impose any restrictions on modifying components (pending straw vote
results) -- that can be done independently with protected components.

This provides compile-time feedback when a client attempts to use a
protected derived type in a way the author intends to disallow, and gives
the author the ability to provide custom alternatives to only those
features they intend to allow.

One example is a linked list, in which one may wish to disallow intrinsic
assignment entirely. Otherwise, a client could inadvertently produce a
shallow-copy.


3. Specifications
=================

To help keep a record of how specs have changed and to aid discussion,
specification labels are preserved from papers 20-121 and 19-214r1.


A. A variable whose declared type is protected shall not appear in a
   variable-definition context, except within the module wherein its type
   is defined.

C. A local variable whose declared type is protected is allowed outside
   the module in which the type is defined.
   - If some action is needed when the variable goes out of scope (and is
     thus destroyed unless it has the SAVE attribute) its type should have
     a final procedure.

D. A local pointer of a protected type is allowed outside the module in
   which the type is defined.
   - Otherwise use case 2.1 in 19-135r1 is not satisfied.

E. Deallocating an object with a protected declared type outside the
   module in which the type is defined is prohibited.
   - Otherwise for pointer, use case 2.1 in 19-135r1 is not satisfied.
   - Allowing it for remote/dummy allocatable would prohibit an allocatable
     variable in the module where the type is defined to be PUBLIC.
   - Allowing for local allocatable breaks rule (A) about not appearing
     in a variable definition context.

F. Allocating an object with a protected declared type outside the module
   in which the type is defined is prohibited.
   - Pointer would almost certainly leak memory.
   - Allowing for remote/dummy allocatable would have same problems as (E).
   - Allowing for local allocatable would have same problems as (E).

J2. A dummy variable of a protected type can be INTENT(IN) or
    INTENT(INOUT) in any procedure anywhere. A dummy variable of such a
    type shall not have INTENT(OUT) or unspecified intent except within the
    module in which the type is defined.
    - If this were allowed, a protected type would be in a variable
      definition context outside the module where it is defined.

K2. The components of a protected type are protected by default
   - This allows for the use case 2.3 presented in 19-135r1.
   - This seems like the most useful default behavior. We would not want
     users to need to write the term "protected" twice as the most common
     use-case.

K3. The components of a protected type may be UNPROTECTED by the user.
   - This would allow writing to an unprotected component of a protected
     type.
     
L2. Polymorphic allocatable assignment of a parent type without a
    protected attribute is permitted even when the dynamic type has a
    protected attribute.
    - This presents a loophole which may allow a programmer to write to a
      protected type outside the module in which it is defined. However,
      subgroup did not like the alternative of disallowing the protected
      attribute in extensions of unprotected parent types.

L3. No intrinsic assignment is permitted to an object whose declared type
    is protected, or that has an ultimate component of protected type,
    outside the module in which the protected component is defined. (cf.
    19-135r1)

M2. A function defined outside the module may have a result variable of a
    protected type.
    - This is same as ordinary local variables (case A).
    - Because intrinsic assignment is disallowed, the function result can
      only be used within an expression or as an argument.
    - The function result will (hopefully) be finalised after its use.
    - If a function returns a unique pointer to a protected type, this
      result should be passed to a procedure in the module to avoid leaking
      memory.

N2. A structure constructor outside the module in which the type is defined
    is not allowed.
    - This is disallowed for the same reason intrinsic assignment is
      disallowed. If you could use a structure constructor you could
      initialize an object with an invalid state.
    - This requirement is not in contradiction with M2, because a function
      outside the module which returns an object of protected type still
      can only produce this object using methods provided by the module
      which defines the protected type.

O. A type may have a component of protected type. A type implicitly has the
   protected attribute if any of its components are of protected type.
   - Note this rule refers to a component of protected type, not a
     protected component.
   - The protection rules apply to types with "potential subobject
     components of protected type" not just types with immediate
     components of protected type. See E, F, L3.
   - Note protection applies only to objects whose declared type is
     protected, not to the dynamic type at runtime. See L2.

P2. Extension of a protected type is permitted.

Q. An extension type may have a protected attribute even if the parent
   type does not have a protected attribute. Requiring the parent type to
   have be protected is too restricted for many uses.
   - See L2.

S. An object with protected declared type are prohibited from being the
   target of a polymorphic pointer whose declared type is not protected or
   of a unlimited polymorphic pointer.
   - This rule applies even inside the module, even if the polymorphic
     pointer is private, because its target might thereafter become
     associated with a public polymorphic pointer.
   - If a user assigns an unprotected polymorphic pointer to a protected
     target, they could subsequently modify or deallocate the target
     outside the module which defines its type.
   - Similarly, if an unprotected polymorphic pointer is associated with an
     object of protected type inside the module which defines it, even if
     that pointer is local, this could be used to release an unprotected
     pointer back outside the module.

T. If an actual argument with a protected declared type is associated with
   an unprotected polymorphic dummy or unlimited polymorphic dummy, the
   dummy shall have INTENT(IN) or INTENT(INOUT) and shall not have TARGET
   (or POINTER, which implies TARGET).
   - If the dummy has TARGET it might become associated with an unprotected
     polymorphic pointer.
   - If the dummy has POINTER, its target might eventually become
     associated with an unprotected polymorphic pointer or unlimited
     polymorphic pointer (see S).


4. Syntax
=========

One may add the PROTECTED attribute to type definitions. One may
independently control the access specifier of each component. The PROTECTED
keyword on a derived-type-stmt is permitted only in the specification part
of a module.

    type, protected :: foo
      real, public :: a ! public, protected component
      real, private :: b ! private, protected component
      real, unprotected :: c ! public, unprotected component
    end type foo


5. Comments
===========

5.1 Is an unprotected type with only protected components the same as a
protected type?

A: No, an unprotected type with all protected components may be copied via
intrinsic assignment, allocated, deallocated, and automatically deallocated
outside the module wherein that type is defined. A protected type disables
all of these "type-level" definition contexts, and thus is more
restrictive.

This distinction is the motivation for having both protected components and
protected types. In some cases a user may want to protect data in a type
from any outside tampering, in which case a protected type is warranted.
In other cases, the user wants to ensure internal consistency in a derived
type, but doesn't want to prevent the user from creating or destroying the
type altogether. A user might also want to avoid expensive copies in getter
procedures, which would be needed for private components. See the use-cases
above.
