From:     Stan Whitlock
Subject:  Interpretation results from WG5 ballot 5 - N1722 & N1726
Date: 2008 May 15

WG5 interp ballot 5 is in N1722;  the results of that ballot are in
N1726.  Many of the interps failed or passed with comments.  Below
is the summary of the comments from N1726 and the disposition of
those comments.

The /interp subcommittee considered the status of these interps
at J3 meeting 184.  The edits for F03/0003 and F03/0004 were
clarified and the inteprs were declared "Passed by WG5 ballot".

Attached are the edited interps in their final form, either
"Passed by WG5 ballot" or "J3 consideration in progress".

In addition to the page/line reference for 04-007, the
position of the edit should be noted as a new paragraph after C1224.

/interp response: we'll make this change.

Bill Long

In the paragraph above the ANSWER:, there is a reference to
"x%nondeferred_proc".  There is no such entity in the program example.
I suspect this should be "x%deferred_proc".

The edit covers 3 of the 4 possible cases. It seems like the 4th
should be covered as well.  We should disallow an undefined pointer,
a disassociated pointer, an unallocated allocatable variable (all
covered), as well as a pointer with an undefined association status.
It's not clear why the last one was left off.

Stan Whitlock
In the paragraph above ANSWER:, the reference to "x%nondeferred_proc"
should be "x%deferred_proc".

Michael Ingrassia

The paragraph immediately above ANSWER is more confusing than
helpful, and in any case is merely a comment by the Interp submitter.
I believe it should be entirely deleted since it is not properly
part of the question nor of the answer.

My reading of the paragraph is that it really means something like:
Because x is disassociated, its dynamic type is the same as its
declared type, thus the interpretation of x%deferred_proc would have
been reasonably clear if deferred_proc had been a nondeferred
procedure [namely the binding in type(t) would be the procedure
called]. It's not worth rewriting the paragraph to make it crystal
clear, but I think its intent is subverted if the reference to
x%nondeferred_proc is simply changed to x%deferred_proc; the
submitter really is talking about nondeferred procedures here.

/interp response:
  The question was about nondeferred procedures, as Mike says.
  The reference x%nondeferred_proc" should remain.

  Bill still believes that the EDIT is wrong:  an "undefined pointer"
  is not the same as "a pointer with an undefined association status".
  In the standard, an "undefined pointer" is a pointer that is
  associated with an undefined target. (See 16.4.2.2).  Malcolm still
  disagrees.  /interp will continue to work on F03/0003.

In addition to the page/line reference for 04-007, the
position of the edit should be noted as a new paragraph after C1224.

/interp response: we'll make this change.

Bill Long

In the DISCUSSION:  The first sentence is of the form "Access to
<undefined concept> (a.k.a. <well defined concept>) always ...".
I have multiple problems with this sentence.

1) It is confusing to introduce a new, undefined term,
"object-bound procedures" when we have a clear, defined term already
"procedure pointer component".

2) Slang like "a.k.a" might be avoided, as a consideration to readers
whose native language is not English.

3) The sentence runs afoul of f08 where procedure pointer components
can have default initialization to a non-NULL target.  In that case,
the question in the interp applies to procedure pointer components
with the NOPASS attribute as well as type-bound procedures.  To head
off another interp in the future, I'd prefer to just delete the whole
DISCUSSION: section.

Finally, the edit is the same as in F03/0003, and thus I have the same
issue as above.

/interp response:
  "a.k.a." is not slang, it is an abbreviation.  The term
  "object-bound" is usefully descriptive terminology.  This is all in
  the DISCUSSION section, not in the EDIT section or even in the
  ANSWER.  Conflict of the edit (not the technical content) with a
  new feature in F2008 is irrelevant.

  But Bill still believes that the EDIT is wrong, as in F03/0003.
  /interp will continue to work on F03/0004.

There is a typo in line 9 of the edits: 'mimimum'.

Stan Whitlock

In line 9 of the edits, "mimimum" should be "minimum".

/interp response:
  We'll fix the typo.

Jim Xia

The second edit says that if <w> is zero, then the output field for
NaN values is 'NaN'.  This seems to be too restrictive.  Processors
should be given options for additional information in the output,
e.g. a processor can provide additional information to specify whether
a NaN is quiet NaN or signaling NaN.

Malcolm Cohen

This argument is without merit.

w==0 is "minimal field width", and explicitly prohibits inclusion of
optional information (such as optional plus signs and leading zeroes).

If w==3 produces "NaN" and not "***", then w==0 producing anything
longer than 3 is, by definition, NOT minimal.

The standard says

   "On output, with ... F editing, the specified value of the field
    width <w> may be zero.  In such case, the processor selects
    the smallest positive actual field width that does not result in
    a field filled with asterisks."

Jim's suggestion is contradicted both by the letter and the
spirit of the minimal width editing feature in the standard.

Jim Xia

Then what about another quote from standard for 10.6.1.2.1. F editing:
"When w is zero, the processor selects the field width." [228:10].
I think this sentence overrides what Malcolm just quoted since this
sentence particularly describe the F editing, while the other is
general description for I, B, O, Z and F editing.

Malcolm Cohen

I cannot agree that
   "the processor selects the field width"
contradicts in ANY way
   "the processor selects the ... field width ...".

The sentence you found does not list all the requirements on the
processor.  That in no way implies there are none.  The word "selects"
does not mean "can pick any value it chooses without limitation"
unless the entire rest of the standard is silent on the matter.  In
particular, it does NOT say "processor-dependent".  The "processor
selects the field width" is drawing a distinction between this case
and the w>0 case which might accurately be characterised as the
"user selects the field width".

Furthermore, re "this sentence overrides": No, that is not true.  If
there is a contradiction in the standard, then there is a
contradiction and the standard is broken.  That is not the case here.

What we have here is a less specific sentence that gives fewer details
than another sentence.  Those details are given in other sentences,
both within 10.6.1.2.1 and elsewhere.

Since
   (a) the text I quoted is completely unambiguous on this question,
   (b) that text is NOT contradicted by other text,
   (c) the w==0 feature was introduced as "minimal field width
       editing" (see various papers in WG5 and J3 in the lead-up to
       F95)
I don't see how there can be any question that the actual field width
when w==0 can be anything other than minimal.

/interp response:
  Stan is convinced by Malcolm's responses but Jim is not.  /interp
  will continue to work on F03/0100.

Van Snyder

The edits for 9.9.1.8, 9.9.1.8, 9.9.12, 9.9.1.24, 9.9.1.27, and
9.9.1.29-32 result in sentences of the form "if ... or if ...".
The edits for 9.9.1.16 and 9.9.1.21 result in the form "if ..., ...,
or...".  For consistency with the others, rather than changing "or if"
to comma, change "or if" to ", if", and rather than inserting ", or
the unit..." insert ", or if the unit...."  (This would only merit a
C vote, not an N vote).

The edit for 9.9.1.17 results in a confusing subclause. I suggest

"If UNIT= appears the <scalar-int-variable> in the NUMBER= specifier
is assigned the value specified by UNIT=.  Otherwise if a unit is
connected to the file specified by the FILE= specifier the value of
the external unit number that is connected to the file is assigned.
Otherwise the value -1 is assigned."

/interp response:
  For consistency, the edits for 9.9.1.16 and 9.9.1.21 have been
  reworded as Van suggests.  /interp did not like the suggested
  rewording for 9.9.1.17 and, following the style of 9.9.1.18,
  instead substituted

  "Execution of an INQUIRE by file statement causes the
   scalar-int-variable in the NUMBER= specifier to be assigned the
   value of the external unit number of the unit that is connected
   to the file.  If there is no unit connected to the file, the
   value -1 is assigned.  Execution of an INQUIRE by unit statement
   causes the scalar-int-variable to be assigned the value specified
   by UNIT=."

David Muxworthy

The page reference, 370, relates to 04-007 of May 2004.  In the

NUMBER: F03/0003
TITLE: Referencing deferred bindings
KEYWORDS: Type-bound procedure, deferred binding
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

QUESTION:

I thought that the intent was that it would be
impossible to reference a deferred binding.  However, it
doesn't appear to me that this intent was achieved.
Consider the following program (Sorry, but I don't have
any compilers up to syntax-checking this).

  module defer

    type, abstract :: t
    contains
      procedure (sub), nopass, deferred :: deferred_proc
    end type t
    type, extends(t) :: t2
    contains
      procedure, nopass :: deferred_proc => sub2
    end type t2

  contains
    subroutine sub
      write (*,*) 'Hello.'
    end subroutine sub
    subroutine sub2
      write (*,*) 'Goodbye.'
    end subroutine sub2
  end module defer
  program p
   use defer
   class(t), pointer :: x

   nullify(x)
   call x%deferred_proc

  end program p

Is this a valid program?  If not, what restriction of the
standard does it violate?

Note that x%deferred_proc does not require the value of x (4.5.7)
and thus is not a reference to x (2.5.6).  Therefore, [83:23-24]
does not prohibit this.  Nor is it clear that there is an intent
to prohibit invocation of type-bound procedures for disassociated
pointer objects; except in the case of deferred bindings, this
seems well-defined and potentially useful.

Because x is disassociated, its dynamic type is the same
as its declared type, thus making the interpretation of
x%nondeferred_proc reasonably clear.

ANSWER:

No, this was not intended to be a valid program. A type-bound
procedure may not be invoked through an undefined pointer, a
disassociated pointer, or an unallocated allocatable variable.
An edit is supplied to clarify this situation.  The same answer
and edit also apply to F03/0004.

EDITS:

All edits refer to 04-007.

Insert after [04-007: 266:24]:

"The <data-ref> shall not be an unallocated allocatable variable
 or a pointer whose association status is disassociated or
 undefined."

Note: this is the same edit as interp F03/0004.

NUMBER: F03/0004
TITLE: Type-bound procedures and undefined association status
KEYWORDS: Type-bound procedure, dynamic type
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

QUESTION:

It appears that the dynamic type is undefined for a pointer with
undefined association status.  This impacts type-bound
procedures. Consider the following program.

  module undefined

    type :: t
    contains
      procedure, nopass :: nondeferred_proc => sub
    end type t
    type, extends(t) :: t2
    contains
      procedure, nopass :: nondeferred_proc => sub2
    end type t2

  contains
    subroutine sub
      write (*,*) 'Hello.'
    end subroutine sub
    subroutine sub2
      write (*,*) 'Goodbye.'
    end subroutine sub2
  end module undefined

  program p
    use undefined
    class(t), pointer :: x
    call x%nondeferred_proc
  end program p

Is this a valid program?  If not, what restriction of the
standard does it violate?  If so, what does it print.

Note that x%nondeferred_proc does not require the value of x (4.5.7)
and thus is not a reference to x (2.5.6).  Therefore, [83:23-24]
does not prohibit this.

If x were disassociated, its dynamic type would be t and the
interpretation of this would be reasonably clear.

However, the standard does not appear to specify the dynamic type
of x when its association status is undefined.  Nor can I find
any prohibition that applies to this case.

ANSWER:

No, the program is not valid, because the standard does not establish
an interpretation of it.  An edit is supplied to clarify this.

Furthermore, the case with a disassociated pointer was not intended to
be valid.  An edit is supplied to correct this oversight.

DISCUSSION:

Access to object-bound procedures (a.k.a. procedure pointer
components) always require there to be an object.  Access to
type-bound procedures of an object was intended to require this too,
but the effect of the NOPASS attribute on this was overlooked.

EDITS:

All edits refer to 04-007.

Insert after [04-007: 266:24]:

"The <data-ref> shall not be an unallocated allocatable variable
 or a pointer whose association status is disassociated or
 undefined."

KEYWORDS: Data edit descriptors, Numeric editing, decimal exponent,

DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

QUESTION:

     In formatted output, what is the value of the
     decimal exponent produced for a real zero value
     under the D, E, EN, ES, and G edit descriptors?

ANSWER:

     In such a case, the decimal exponent should have
     the value zero whether or not a nonzero scale factor
     is in effect.   Edits are supplied to make this clear.

DISCUSSION:

The Fortran 2003 standard does not specify what the value of the
decimal exponent of a real zero value should be under formatted
output.  Every implementation of which Sun is aware uses the value
zero for the decimal exponent unless a nonzero scale factor is in
effect.  Different implementations format real zeros differently under
nonzero scale factors, but the difference is mainly in the form of the
mantissa and not the exponent.

EDITS:

[227:15+] At the end of the numbered list in 10.6.1 "Numeric

STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

QUESTION:

     Suppose a Fortran processor's representation of the real zero
     value is signed.  When a negative real zero value is written
     using formatted output, does the Fortran 2003 standard require
     the representation of the zero value in the output field to be
     prefixed with a minus sign?

ANSWER:

     Yes, the negative sign is required to appear in formatted output
     of a negative zero value. In subclause 10.6.1, list item (3) at
     [227:3-4] says "The representation of a negative internal value
     in the field shall be prefixed with a minus sign." For a
     processor that distinguishes between positive and negative zero,
     there is no exemption for output at [38:1-6]. For the case of
     IEEE reals, the IEEE_IS_NEGATIVE function at [375:25] explicitly
     says that -0.0 is "negative".

STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Is there an error in the description for the output of a IEEE infinity
with a sign and a field width of 3 or 8?

228:36-37 describes the output for an IEEE infinity and special cases
field widths of 3 and 8.  But, the special casing doesn't consider the
possibility of a plus or minus sign in the field.  A signed infinity
should be special cased for field widths of 9 and 4.  The current text
also fails to take into account the case of <w> = 0, for both Infinity
and NaN values.

ANSWER:

Yes, there is an error in the special cases.  Edits are provided to
correctly describe the required field widths for signed infinities.
An edit is also provided to repair the description of the output of
NaN values.

EDITS:

[228:36-37] In the paragraph beginning "For an internal value that is
an IEEE infinity." in 10.6.1.2.1 "F editing" replace the final
sentence with:

"The minimum field width required for output of the form 'Inf' is 3 if
no sign is produced, and 4 otherwise. If <w> is greater than zero but
less than the minimum required, the field is filled with asterisks.
The minimum field width for output of the form 'Infinity' is 8 if no
sign is produced and 9 otherwise.  If <w> is zero or <w> is less than
the minimum required but large enough to produce the form 'Inf',
the form 'Inf' is output."

[229:2] In the paragraph in 10.6.1.2.1 "F editing" covering the output
of NaN values, replace the last sentence "If <w> ... asterisks." with
"If <w> is greater than zero and less than 3, the field is filled with
asterisks.  If <w> is zero, the output field is 'NaN'.".

  F03/0100 summary of Jim Xia's issues:
    1. The standard puts similar but somewhat different sentences in
       three places, which is inconsistent.  Only one sentence (in
       E editing) is complete while the other two (one for integer
       editing, and one for F editing) are both incomplete.
    2. As to the restriction on output being "NaN" for F editing when
       w == 0, I'm still not convinced it is to the best benefit to
       Fortran users given the fact that the majority of the
       processors today distinguish qNaNs vs. sNaNs.

DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation

INTRODUCTION:

Consider the following example assuming a derived type of X is
declared previously and made accessible to the current scoping unit,

    type(X), pointer :: a(:), b(:,:)

    allocate (a(100))
    b(1:10, 1:10) => a

    DEALLOCATE (b)

QUESTION:

    (a) Is DEALLOCATE (b) in the example intended to be standard
        conforming?

    (b) If the answer to (a) is yes, and also assume type X has
        finalizers of both rank-one and rank-two, then which finalizer
        should be invoked by the DEALLOCATE statement.

ANSWER:

    (a) Yes, the example is intended to be standard conforming.  The
        deallocation of pointer b should be executed successfully.

    (b) The Standard is clear about how the finalizations are
        processed in this case.  In 4.5.5.1, the first step in
        invoking the appropriate final subroutine requires a
        finalizer matching the rank of the entity being finalized.
        In this case, object b is being finalized and therefore the
        rank-two final subroutine of type X will be invoked with
        object b as the actual argument.

or similar words.  In other cases, such as READ, there seems
to be a tacit assumption that there is a file connected to the
unit.  The descriptions refer to "the file" and don't specify a
result if there is no connection.  In most cases, there is a
phrase like "if the processor is unable to determine if the
file ... [the result is] {UNDEFINED, UNKNOWN, -1, etc.}".

Question 1)  Are the inquire specifiers DIRECT, ENCODING,
FORMATTED, NAMED, NEXTREC, NUMBER, POS, READ, READWRITE,
SEQUENTIAL, SIZE, STREAM, UNFORMATTED, and WRITE allowed
in an INQUIRE by unit when there is no file connected to the
unit?

Question 2)  If so, should the descriptions for the above
specifiers be clarified by adding phrases such as "if there is
no file specified or connected" to the "UNKNOWN" result
descriptions?

ANSWER:

Question 1)  Yes.  In an inquiry by unit, the specifiers have
little meaning when there is no file connected to the unit.
However, the standard should specify the results.

Question 2)  Yes, edits are supplied below.

NUMBER: F03/0107
TITLE: Are the IEEE_* elemental routines required
KEYWORDS: IEEE, elemental routines
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

QUESTION:

The descriptions for all of the IEEE elemental intrinsics listed in
14.9 say something like "shall not be invoked if
IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE(X) is false".

I believe this was to allow a careful programmer to do something
like

        if (IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE(x)) then
               x = IEEE_SCALB(x,2)
        else
               x = x*4
        endif

and program around partial IEEE support.

But 14.9.2 says that "IEEE_ARITHMETIC contains the following
[routines] for which IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE(X) [is] true"

I'd read that as saying the functions aren't there for cases where
IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE is false.  But, then, there is no way to
program around their absence.  The example above will fail at load
time because IEEE_SCALB is absent.

If a processor provides the IEEE_ARITHMETIC module must it
provide versions of all of the intrinsics for all of the available
datatypes, including those for which IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE() is false?

ANSWER:

Yes, edits are provided to make this clear.

DISCUSSION:  It was intended that the above coding snippet could be
used by a careful programmer to program portably for processors which
have varying degrees of IEEE support.  This might require processors
to provide some stub function for each routine and for each non-IEEE
datatype they support.  If a program invokes one of the stub routines,
it is a run-time programming error.  Nevertheless, a program which
has references to the routines, but doesn't invoke them, must load
and execute.

EDITS:

In the first paragraph of subclause 14.9.2 [370:8-9] Replace

      "for reals X and Y for which IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE(X) and
       IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE(Y) are true"

    with

      "for all reals X and Y"

NOTE:

The following note should be inserted at the end of the section on
IEEE arithmetic in a future standard:

"The standard requires that code such as

        if (IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE(x)) then
               x = IEEE_SCALB(x,2)
        else
               x = x*4
        endif

be executable.  The elemental functions in the IEEE_ARITHMETIC
module (14.9.2) must exist for all real kinds supported by the
processor, even if IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE returns false for
some kinds.  However, if IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE returns false
for a particular kind, these functions must not be invoked
with arguments of that kind.  This allows a careful programmer
to write programs that work on processors that do not support
IEEE arithmetic for all real kinds.

The processor might provide stub routines which allow the program
to link and execute, but which will abort if they are invoked."

NUMBER: F03/0108
TITLE: Is IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN consistent with the other IEEE_SUPPORT
       functions
KEYWORDS: IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN, IEEE support functions
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

QUESTION:

The restriction of IEEE_IS_NAN requires that IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN returns
the value true.  The restrictions for the similar functions
IEEE_IS_{FINITE, NEGATIVE, and NORMAL} all require that
IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE be true.  This is a much stronger restriction.

Should IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN also require that IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE
return true?

ANSWER:

No.  The IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN restriction is weaker than requiring
IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE but IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN is sufficient.
IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE is used in IEEE_IS_FINITE, IEEE_IS_NEGATIVE,
and IEEE_IS_NORMAL because there are no IEEE_SUPPORT_* inquiry
functions to query support for finite, negative, or normal.
IEEE_SUPPORT_INF asks about infinities not finites and
IEEE_SUPPORT_DENORMAL only covers denormals and not the other
non-finites (NaNs and Infinities).

EDITS:

None.
