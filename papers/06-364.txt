Discussion

It appears that the current text of the draft does not make it clear
that BOZ constants are of type BITS. Since the term BOZ appears in
only a few places in the draft, I propose we change it to bits to
avoid confusion.  This makes the syntax term and type description more
consistent with those of other types.
