Most Fortran vendors also support C/C++ compilers,
or utilize C/C++ RTLs to supply low-level services.
The C/C++ libm contains a few mathematical routines
which would be of use to Fortran programs.  Standardizing
names for these routines aids portability
of Fortran programs.

Title: C libm functions as Fortran intrinsics

Submitted By: J3

Status: For Consideration

References: C99 7.12 Mathematics <math.h> page 211 et seq.
            Unix Programmer's Manual, Volume 2, System calls
            and Library Routines (3m)

Basic Functionality: Add the Bessel functions, hypot, and error functions
                     to the Fortran intrinsic function set
                     for real arguments.

Rationale:  Fortran is mainly used for numerical problems, supplying
            mathematical functions of proven utility will assist
            Fortran is continuing as the premier mathematical programming
            language in the world today.

Estimated Impact: The estimated impact at 167 was 4 on the John Reid scale.

                  These are proposed intrinsic functions, no other feature
                  is affected.  Impact on vendors is minimal,
                  as most vendors support these functions anyway
                  for their C/C++ compilers.

Detailed Specification: Add subsections to Section 13 detailing
                        the Fortran names for these procedures.  (The C names
                        should not be used due to the common usage, in
                        Fortran, of names such as j0 etc.)

                        The functions are (the C names):

                        Bessel functions (j0, j1, jn, y0, y1, yn)
                        Error Functions (erf, erfc)
                        Hypotenuse (hypot)
                        Gamma and log gamma (tgamma, lgamma)

                        The detailed mathematical specification of these
                        procedures is given in the references above.
                        The intention is to allow the vendor to use
                        the procedure supplied by libm, so the exact
                        specification is left to libm, which is most likely
                        what the applications programmer wants.

                        Since Fortran does not support the concept
                        of external variables, the signgam variable of lgamma
                        may be defined as an optional intent(out)
                        argument.

                        Edits would include adding to the list in 13.5.2:

                        BESSEL_J0
                        BESSEL_J1
                        BESSEL_JN
                        BESSEL_Y0
                        BESSEL_Y1
                        BESSEL_YN
                        COMP_ERROR_FUNC
                        ERROR_FUNC
                        GAMMA_FUNC
                        HYPOT
                        LOG_GAMMA_FUNC
