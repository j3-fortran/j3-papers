1. Introduction

This paper contains the edits for the conditional expressions feature.
For background, please see 18-274.
For formal specifications, please see 20-142.
For syntax, please see 21-157.

Note that edits for the two syntax forms in 21-157 are provided.
If a variation of one of the forms in 21-157 is chosen,
it should be straightforward to modify the edits below.


2. Edits to 21-007r1 for conditional expressions (only)

2.1 Basic edits

[xiii] Introduction, Data usage and computation bullet, append
       "Conditional expressions provide selective evaluation of part of
        an expression without evaluating other parts."

[149:26+] 10.1.2.2 Primary, R1001 primary, add new production
    "<<or>> <conditional-expr>"

[150:1-] Before 10.1.2.3 Level-1 expressions, insert new subclause
         (note: angle brackets omitted in the BNF as all lowercase is
                either bold (is/or) or italic (BNF terms).

    "10.1.2.2a Conditional expressions

     A conditional expression is a primary that selectively evaluates a
     chosen sub-expression.

     R1001a conditional-expr is IF ( scalar-logical-expr  ) THEN ( expr )
                                [ ELSE IF ( scalar-logical-expr )
                                  THEN ( expr ) ]...
                                ELSE ( expr ) END IF

     C1003a Each <expr> of a <conditional-expr> shall have the same
            declared type, kind type parameters, and rank.

     NOTE 1
     Examples of a conditional expression are:

     IF( ABS(RESIDUAL)<=TOL )THEN( 'ok' )ELSE( 'did not converge' )ENDIF

     IF( I>0 .AND. I<=SIZE(A) )THEN( A(I) )ELSE IF( PRESENT(VAL) )&
     THEN( VAL )ELSE( 0.0 )ENDIF"
{The opening paragraph is mere witter to introduce the syntax.}
{This version of R1001a is for the keyword form; versions for other forms
 appear in the next section.}
{Note the constraint says "<expr> of" not "<expr> in", so we know which
 expressions it applies to. If that's too subtle we could introduce a new
 syntax term, but I think it is reasonably understandable as is.}
{I think the last example will fit on one line in the standard.}

[155:17+] 10.1.4 Evaluation of operations, end of subclause (after p5),
         insert new paragraphs

   "Evaluation of a <conditional-expr> evaluates each <scalar-logical-expr>
    in order, until the value of a <scalar-logical-expr> is true, or there
    are no more <scalar-logical-expr>s. If the value of a <scalar-logical-
    expr> is true, its subsequent <expr> is chosen; otherwise, the last
    <expr> of the <conditional-expr> is chosen. The chosen <expr> is
    evaluated, and its value is the value of the conditional expression.

    The declared type, kind type parameters, and rank of a <conditional-
    expr> are the same as those of its <expr>s. The dynamic type, length
    type parameters, and shape are those of the chosen <expr>. A
    <conditional-expr> is polymorphic if and only if one or more of its
    <expr>s is polymorphic.

    NOTE 3
    Only one <expr> of a conditional expression is evaluated, and any of
    its <scalar-logical-expr>s subsequent to one that evaluates to true
    are not evaluated."


2.2 Edit modifications for concise syntax

[47:10] 6.2.1 Tokens, p1,
        after "..,"
        insert "?, :?,"
        making that whole sentence read
            "A lexical token is a keyword, name, literal constant other
             than a complex literal constant, operator, statement label,
             delimiter, comma, =, =>, :, ::, ;, .., ?, :?, or %."

[49:29] 6.2.6 Delimiters, p1,
        change "or /)"
        to "/), (?, or ?)",
        making the whole paragraph read
            "A lexical token that is a delimiter is a (, ), /, [, ], (/,
             /), (?, or ?)."

For concise syntax instead of keyword syntax, replace the BNF rule only
(the rest of the edit remaining as is) in the edit for [145:1-]:

    "R1001a conditional-expr is (? scalar-logical-expr | expr
                                [ :? scalar-logical-expr | expr ]...
                                : expr ?)"

In the edit for [150:1-], change the examples to

    "(? ABS(RESIDUAL)<=TOL ? 'ok' : 'did not converge' ?)

     (? I>0 .AND. I<=SIZE(A) ? A(I) :? PRESENT(VAL) ? VAL : 0.0 ?)"


3. Additional edits to 21-007 for conditional arguments

3.1 Basic edits

[xiii] Introduction, Program units and procedures bullet, append
       "Conditional arguments provide inline selection of an actual
        argument in a procedure reference."

[315:26+] 15.5.1 Syntax of a procedure reference, R1524 actual-arg,
          after "<<or>> proc-component-ref"
          insert new production
            "<<or>> <conditional-arg>"

[316:4] C1535 replace "(R1524) <expr> shall not be a variable" entirely:
    "C1535 An <actual-arg> that is an <expr> shall not be a variable or
           a <conditional-expr>."
{NOTE: This is a disambiguating constraint, not a "the processor must check
       this" constraint.}

[316:7+] After the last constraint in this subclause (C1537), insert new
         BNF and constraints.

    "R1525a conditional-arg is
        IF ( scalar-logical-expr ) THEN ( consequent-arg )
        [ ELSE IF ( scalar-logical-expr ) THEN ( consequent-arg ) ]...
        [ ELSE ( else-consequent-arg ) ]
        END IF
     R1525b consequent-arg is expr
                           or variable
     R1535c else-consequent-arg is consequent-arg

     C1537a Each <consequent-arg> in a <conditional-arg> shall have the
            same declared type, and kind type parameters.

     C1537b Either all <consequent-arg>s in a <conditional-arg> shall have
            the same rank, or be assumed-rank.

     C1537c If its corresponding dummy argument is not optional,
            <conditional-arg> shall have an <else-consequent-arg>.

     C1537d If its corresponding dummy argument is INTENT (OUT) or
            INTENT (INOUT), each <consequent-arg> in a <conditional-arg>
            shall be a variable.

     C1537e If its corresponding dummy argument is allocatable, a pointer,
            or a coarray, the attributes of each <consequent-arg> in a
            <conditional-arg> shall satisfy the requirements of that dummy
            argument.

     C1537f A <consequent-arg> shall not be assumed-rank unless its
            corresponding dummy argument is assumed-rank.

     C1537g A <consequent-arg> that is an <expr> shall not be a variable.

     C1537h In a reference to a generic procedure, each <consequent-arg> in
            a <conditional-arg> shall have the same corank, and if any
            <expr> in a <conditional-arg> has the allocatable or pointer
            attribute, each <expr> shall have that attribute."
{C1537f might be inferred from C838, so could be unnecessary.}
{NOTE: C1537g is another disambiguating constraint.}

[318:1-] Immediately before 15.5.2.3 Argument association, insert subclause
    "15.5.2.2a Conditional argument correspondence

     If an <actual-arg> is a <conditional-arg>, each <scalar-logical-expr>
     is evaluated in order, until the value of a <scalar-logical-expr> is
     true, or there are no more <scalar-logical-expr>s. If the value of a
     <scalar-logical-expr> is true, its subsequent <consequent-arg> is
     chosen; otherwise, if <else-consequent-arg> appears, its
     <consequent-arg> is chosen.

     If a <consequent-arg> is chosen, its <expr> or <variable> is the
     actual argument for the corresponding dummy argument, and if it is an
     <expr>, it is evaluated. If no <consequent-arg> is chosen, there is no
     actual argument for that dummy argument.

     Each <consequent-arg> in a <conditional-arg> shall satisfy any
     requirements of the dummy argument on declared type, kind type
     parameters, attributes, and properties that do not depend on
     evaluation of the <consequent-arg> or any contained expressions.

     The declared type, kind type parameters, rank, and corank of a
     <conditional-arg> are those of its <consequent-arg>s. It has the
     ALLOCATABLE or POINTER attribute if and only if all of its
     <consequent-arg>s have that attribute. It is polymorphic if and only
     if one or more of its <consequent-arg>s is polymorphic.

     NOTE 1
     An example of a conditional argument in a procedure reference is:

     CALL sub( IF( x>0 )THEN( x )ELSE IF( y>0 )THEN( y )ELSE( z )ENDIF, &
               IF( edge>0 )THEN( edge )ELSEIF( mode==3 )THEN( 1.0 )ENDIF, &
               some, other, arguments)"
{I omitted the stuff about not evaluating non-chosen things, as that would
 just complicate the description without saying anything new. A note could
 be added if thought useful.}
{We could add these paragraphs to 15.5.2.1 Argument correspondence instead.
 That subclause is one giant indigestible paragraph though, which would
 warrant serious wordsmithing if we're going to add anything more.}
{The penultimate paragraph is to enforce things like "allocatable dummies
 require allocatable actuals" without listing them all.}
{The last paragraph is there for generic resolution, which needs to know
 these things. It's not necessary for a specific procedure reference as the
 actual argument is the chosen consequent-arg, not the conditional-arg
 itself.}


3.2 Edit modifications for concise syntax

Instead of the R1525a shown above, use this one:
    "R1525a conditional-arg is
        (? scalar-logical-expr ? consequent-arg
        [ :? scalar-logical-expr ? consequent-arg ]...
        [ : else-consequent-arg ]
        ?)"

In the edit for [318:1-], change the example to
    "CALL sub( (? x>0 | x :? y>0 | y : z ?), &
               (? edge>0 | edge :? mode==3 | 1.0 ?), &
               some, other, arguments)"
