Issue 1:

Add unresolved issues to make sure we check to see if we use the C
terminology "linkage" and "external definition" (vs. declaration) correctly.  A
side issue in this discussion raised the issue as to whether we should permit
initialization of variables with the BIND attribute.

Edits:

[65:2+] add J3 internal note:

  "Unresolved issue 238

   We currently prohibit initialization of variables in COMMON or variables if
   the COMMON block or variable name has the BIND attribute.  Should we
   relax that?  If so, and if this discussion gets into whether the object
   is "owned" by C procedure where it is defined (in C sense, C standard 6.9)
   make sure we use concept of "external definition" correctly."

[273:18+] add J3 internal note:
   "Unresolved issue 239

    We are using the phrases "external linkage".  We need to verify these terms
    are consistent with the C terminology "linkage" in the C standard (6.2).
    These terms are also used in section 16.2.7, Interoperation with C global
    variables."

Issue 2:

We do not discuss what happens if a main program is defined by means other than
Fortran.  How does all the magic "start-up" such as run-time system
inititialization happen?  Add unresolved issue to note this.

Edit:

[235:40+] add J3 internal note:
    "Unresolved issue 240

     We need to note here or in chapter 16 that a main program may be defined
     by means other than Fortran.  In addition, subclause 2.1 currently states
     that "A program shall contain exactly one <main-program> <program-unit>."
     This would need to change to require the <main-program> to be omitted when
     main is provided by C.

     At that point we need to add a note or an Appendix C entry, for the
     benefit of implementors, stating that if a program mixes program units
     specified by means other than Fortran and program units specified by
     Fortran, the Fortran runtime must be initialized as well as the C runtime
     environment."

Issue 3:

What happens if a program terminates while executing a C function?  For example,
by calling exit(), returning from a C main() or reaching the closing "}" in a C
main(), calling _Exit(), calling abort(), etc.

We need to state the same program "clean-up" occurs as would happen if a
program terminates while executing a Fortran program unit by executing a STOP
statement or if the program terminates by "encountering" the END of a main
program unit.  "Clean-up" includes things like closing files, etc.

Similarly, we need to state what happens if a program terminates while executing
Fortran code.  For example, reaching the END PROGRAM statement, executing a
STOP statement.  The C standard states that a value is returned to the system
by main and that files are closed.

Edit:

[177:42+] add J3 internal note:

   "Unresolved issue 241

    We need to discuss what happens if program termination occurs during exec-
    tion of a program unit defined by C, or if it occurs by C executing the
    exit() function.  Clean-up work needs to occur for the Fortran runtime
    environment such as closing of files, ensuring all output from I/O appears
    in the appropriate files, etc.  Conversly, we may need to also state that
    normal C clean-up occurs if termination occurs thru means defined by
    Fortran.

    A note or appendix C entry may indicate that such functionality could
    be provided if at startup time the housekeeping functions normal executed
    when a program terminates by a Fortran STOP or END statement are registered
    thru the C "atexit" library function."

Issue 4:

We need to make an edit which prohibits a procedure from calling C main(), and
one which prohibits a program unit defined by means other than Fortran from
calling a Fortran main program unit.

Edit:

[273:41+] add J3 internal note:

   "Unresolved issue 242

    We need to prohibit a procedure from calling the C function main(), and
    also prohibit a C function from calling main() if there is a Fortran
    <main-program> <program-unit>."

Issue 5: What do we do with C signal handling?

Edit:

[390:20+] add J3 internal note

   "Unresolved issue 243

    Fortran now contains exception handling.  We need to investigate what we
    need to say about C signal handling.  What happens if an exception is
    raised while executing Fortran code, or if a C signal is raised while
    executing C code (do C signals affect Fortran exception handling, does
    Fortran exception handling affect C signals)?  Can a Fortran procedure
    be installed as a signal handler?  Does POSIX cover any of this?"

Issue 6: Interaction of C and Fortran I/O

Edit:

[171:38+] add J3 internal note

   "Unresolved issue 244

   We need to talk about interoperability of C I/O and Fortran I/O.  Probably
   prohibit C and Fortran I/O to same files within a program.  Other
   prohibitions?  Unresolved issues 240 and 241 discuss related needs for
   defining initialization and finalization of I/O environments (ensuring
   start-up and clean-up work occurs for both languages, regardless of which
   language main is written in).

   Perhaps we should also have a note to say something about stdout, stdin,
   stderr vs. INPUT_UNIT, OUTPUT_UNIT and ERROR_UNIT.  For example, we could
   state that they might all be associated with the same terminal device, for
   instance, and could be conceptually viewed as separate files, even though
   their records might actually be interleaved on the terminal."

Issue 7:  C 99 introduces the concept of Universal character names to provide
a means of specifying identifiers with names composed of characters in the
ISO 10646 character set through encoded hexadecimal values.  This edit makes it
clear that there was no intention to allow such C entities to be linked with
Fortran entities.

Edit:
[79:15+] Add a new note

   "Note 5.xx

    The C standard provides a facility for creating C identifiers whose
    characters are not composed of the C basic character set.  Such a C
    identifier is referred to as a Universal character name (6.4.3 of the C
    standard).  The name of such a C identifier may include characters that are
    not part of the representation method used by the processor for type
    default character.  If so, the C entity cannot be linked (12.5.3, 16.2.7.1)
    with a Fortran entity.

    This standard does not require a processor to provide a means of linking
    Fortran entities with C entities whose names are specified using the
    Universal character name facility."

Issue 8: In C99, a pointer's value becomes indeterminate if it is pointing at an
object when that object reaches the end of its lifetime.  We need to state that
a C_PTR in such a situation would become undefined.

Edit:
[359:38+] Add a J3 internal note

   "Unresolved issue 245

    In C99, a pointer's value becomes indeterminate if it is pointing at an
    object when that object reaches the end of its lifetime.  We need to state
    that an entity of type C_PTR in such a situation would become undefined."

Issue 9: C 99 introduces two new types, _Bool and _Imaginary. Add new logical
kind type C_BOOL to ISO_C_BINDING intrinsic module.  Note, _Imaginary type can
interoperate with reals, as its representation is that of a C float.

Edits:

[385:18] after "C_CHAR, "
         add   "C_BOOL, "

[386:6+] insert new paragraph
                "The value of C_BOOL shal be a valid value for a logical kind
                 type parameter on the processor or shall be -1."

[387:23+] In box with "float"
          add         "float _Imaginary"

[387:24+] In box with "double"
          add         "double _Imaginary"

[387:25+] In box with "long double"
          add         "long double _Imaginary""

[387:29+] add new table entry
              "LOGICAL    C_BOOL                     _Bool"

Issue 10:  00-007 currently relies on the idea that C types that have the same
representation are compatible types, and uses the term "compatible" in that
way.  In fact, that's not correct.  For example, entities of type "int" and
"const int" have the same representation in C, but the types are not actually
compatible.  Because Fortran provides no way of specifying the qualifiers that
C can specify, other than volatile, the user is limited in the range of C
entities with which to interoperate.

Furthermore, 00-007 assumes that because an entity of type integer with kind
C_INT, say, interoperates with a C entity of type int, it can also interoperate
with a C entity of type unsigned int.  However, that's not supported by the C
standard, which makes it very clear that they are different types, and not
compatible, even though the positive values of the signed type have the same
representation as the corresponding values of the unsigned type.

Edit:

[386:30+] Add J3 internal note

   "Unresolved issue 246

    The preceding text states that a scalar Fortran entity of a type and kind
    specified in Table 16.1 interoperates with a scalar C entity of a type that
    is compatible with the specified C type.  However, we probably really want
    to say something like "of any type compatible (6.2.7 of the C standard)
    with or with the same representation (6.2.5 of the C standard) as the
    indicated C type".

    Making that change, if correct, allows a variable of type INTEGER(C_INT) to
    interoperate with variables of all of the types int, unsigned int,
    const int, register const volatile unsigned int, et al.  Without that
    change, I believe such a variable can only interoperate with variables of
    type int or any typedef equivalent to int."

Issue 11:  00-007 is silent on the issue of ellipsis.  Subgroup believes the
standard will either need to state explicitly that no Fortran procedure
interoperates with a C function with ellipsis at the end of its parameter list
or provide facilities for handling it.

Edit:

[390:20+] Add J3 internal note

   "Unresolved issue 247

    We need to explicitly say something about ellipsis.  Either state that a
    Fortran procedure does not interoperate with a C function with an ellipsis
    punctuator or make lots of ugly changes to deal with them from Fortran,
    like specifying ellipsis in an interface body, issues with resolving
    generic interfaces in the presence of ellipsis, problems with argument
    keywords in a reference to a procedure with ellipsis... .  Not to make a
    value judgment."

Issue 12:  Should Fortran code have access to errno?

Edit:

[386:14+] Add J3 internal note

   "Unresolved issue 248

    Should we provide facilities to set and query the value of errno?"

Issue 13:  There is a potential problem in the interaction of the setting of
the IEEE rounding mode in Fortran code and in C code.

Edit:

[364:29+] Add J3 internal note

   "Unresolved issue 249

    The preceding specifies that a Fortran subprogram must restore the rounding
    mode that was in effect on entry to the subprogram prior to returning to its
    caller.  Because IEEE_SET_ROUNDING_MODE is the only procedure defined by
    this standard that affects rounding mode, a processor need only check
    whether a call to IEEE_SET_ROUNDING_MODE appeared in the subprogram in order
    to determine whether it is necessary to save the rounding mode on entry and
    restore it on return.

    A call to a C function might affect the rounding mode.  How is a Fortran
    processor to deal with the preceding requirement in light of that fact?  If
    it saves and restores the rounding mode around every call to a C procedure,
    that will destroy the performance of the program.  The standard could
    require that a C function called from Fortran obey this same rule, since
    the Fortran processor itself can't conveniently enforce the rule."

Issue 14:  Subgroup didn't want setjmp and longjmp to jump through Fortran
code.

Edit:

[273:41+] Add J3 internal note

   "Unresolved issue 250

    We need to prohibit Fortran code from calling setjmp or longjmp, and
    prohibit C code from calling setjmp, and then calling Fortran code that
    calls C code that calls longjmp.  Or we could prohibit the calls to setjmp
    and longjmp anywhere in a program that contains any Fortran program units."

Issue 15:  The C99 standard defines a header file named <stdint.h>.  This
provides typedefs for exact-width integer types (e.g., int8_t), minimum-width
integer types (e.g., int_least32_t) and fastest minimum-width integers types
(e.g., uint_fastest16_t).  It also provides a header file named <stddef.h> that
provides types ptrdiff_t, size_t and wchar_t.

Some of the types in <stdint.h> could be of use to users of Interoperability.
However, of the types declared in <stddef.h>, perhaps only size_t is of use.

Edit:

[385:24+] Add J3 internal note

   "Unresolved issue 251

    We might want to make accessible kind parameters that help the user to
    declare entities that interoperate with entities of type int8_t,
    int_least16_t, uint_fastest32_t, et al. or type size_t."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Issues 16-21 were raised by paper 00-121 (William Mitchell).

Several of the issues in 00-121 have solutions with the current function-
ality provided by interoperablity.  Others raised in the paper cannot
be fixed soley by changes to Fortran.  Others could be fixed, but not
without radical surgery to the document, and by adding functionality not
currently in the scope of interoperability requirements.  The following
issues are those which subgroup and William Mitchell agreed should or
will be done for F2K.

Issue 16:

It is critical for writing bindings to C libraries to have a capability to
compare a C_PTR to a null pointer, or to compare two C_PTRs to one another.
To do so, two things are needed.

Edits:

Section 16.1
[385:18-19] replace "and C_LOC."
            with    "C_LOC, and C_NULL_PTR."

[386:14+]  add new paragraph
               "The entity C_NULL_PTR shall be a named constant of type
                C_PTR.  The value of C_NULL_PTR shall be the same as the
                value NULL in C."

           "Unresolved issue 252

           A new function, IF_C_PTRS_EQ(arg1,arg2) must be added to the list
           in first paragraph of 16.1 (not married to the name).  The
           result is type logical, true if the arguments are equal, false
           otherwise.  We need a new section in 16.2, "The C pointer
           compare operator", which describes this function.

           Discussion in subgroup examined several options, an IS_NULL
           function, an IS_EQUAL, extending .EQ. or ASSOCIATED.  As C_PTRs are
           very different than Fortran POINTERs, subgroup rejected extending
           ASSOCIATED.  A C_PTR can be a type alias which could map to an
           INTEGER type.  Comparison with .EQ. could then degenerate
           to an INTEGER comparison for some implementation(s), and then
           comparison to an INTEGER constant would be possible.  This was seen
           as getting dangerously close to progressing into defining pointer
           arithmetic; a can of worms we do not intend to open.  Thus we settled
           on one C_PTR compare function, and an entity C_NULL_PTR which is a
           constant of type C_PTR which can be used as an argument in this
           function.

           We might also want to consider permitting an implementation to define
           assignment for type C_PTR.  For instance, if a C processor maintains
           a use count with a pointer, a simple copy of the value through
           intrinsic assignment of an entity of type C_PTR might not give
           correct behaviour."

Issue 17:

The syntax for enums limits the number of enumerators which can be declared
for each enum due to the limit of continuation lines.  The syntax for enums
will be changed to a "block structured" form, similar to a derived type
declaration to correct this problem.  Edits are planned for paper 00-149 at
this meeting.

Issue 18:

The definition of the result of C_LOC should be made clearer.

Edit:

Section 16.2.3
[388:18+] Add J3 internal note
              "Unresolved issue 253

               The description of C_LOC should be made more clear.  Something
               like the following would be a start:

               The result is the same as would be returned by the C expression
               "<<&>>Y" (section 6.5.3.2 of C standard), if X appeared in the
               statement
                    BIND(C,NAME="Y") :: X

               However, we also need to be able to take into account subobjects.
               We don't say anything about how elements of a Fortran array
               share storage with elements of a C array, or components of a
               structure with members of a C struct, etc.

               This ties into unresolved issue 219 (16.2.7.1) which points out
               that we don't say how changing the value of a C thing affects
               the linked Fortran thing and vice versa.  Both issues can be
               addressed at the same time by building up a description of how
               elements, components, characters, etc. correspond with one
               another, then saying that defining/undefining one causes the
               other to become defined with the same value or undefined.  When
               we have that, we can say that calling C_LOC for the Fortran thing
               is the same as applying <<&>> to the corresponding C thing."

Issue 19:

Wording of interoperation with C char strings should be clarified.

Edit:

Section 16.2.1
[386:38+] add J3 note
              "Unresolved issue 254

               Perhaps a better description of what it means for C and Fortran
               character strings to interoperate is desirable.  (See 3.6 of
               00-121.)"

Issue 20:

Section 3.7 points out deficiencies with commandline arguments.

Edit:

[236:40+] Add J3 internal note
              "Unresolved issue 255

               Paper 00-121, section 3.7 discusses problems with commandline
               arguments (argv).  Paper 00-139, if passed resolves these
               issues."

Issue 21:

It is desireable to be able to call a MODULE PROCEDURE from a procedure
defined by means other than Fortran.  This edit also adds the edit from
00-118, item 5.
Edit:

Section 12.5.2.1


[266:10+] Add to existing J3 note (issue 151)
              "Additional information, meeting 152

               It has been decided to allow module procedures to have
               a language binding spec.  The above constraint must be
               removed, but there is an issue about the data in the
               specification part of the module which is not saved if
               the procedure is invoked but the module is out of scope.
               One solution is to make the appearance of a bind spec for
               a module procedure to imply SAVE for all entities in the
               specification part of a module.

               The potential issue of using a C_PTR to a module procedure
               (when BIND(C) is allowed) is exactly the same as the case
               of using a C_PTR to an external procedure that contains a
               common block or a USE statement.  I.e. We must resolve what
               happens or what is allowed with C_PTRs anyway, allowing
               BIND(C) module procedures would not make this worse.

               Isn't the module out of scope problem already an issue in
               F95?  Is the above also an issue for Fortran procedure
               pointers?  The problem is not unique to interop.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Other additional issues:

Issue:

The parentheses are not required on a subroutine statement with no
arguments.  This results in a syntax ambiguity if  BIND(C) is present, as
the subroutine statement could be either a subroutine statement, or BIND
attribute statement.

      BIND(C) SUBROUTINE JOE ! subroutine JOE or variable SUBROUTINEJOE?

Similar ambiguities can occur when BIND(C) is allowed on an ENTRY statement
(planned).

Edit:

Section 12.5.2.2
[269:24+] add J3 note
              "Unresolved issue 256

              There is a syntax ambiguity if there are no arguments and
              the parenthsis are not present

                BIND(C) SUBROUTINE JOE ! attribute or subroutine statement

              Change syntax to make language binding spec a suffix spec
              similar to a function RESULT=.  Change should also be
              applied to FUNCTION and ENTRY so syntax is similar for all."
