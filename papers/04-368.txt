Subject: Interpretation request on elemental type-bound procedures

NUMBER:
TITLE: Invoking type-bound procedures via array objects
KEYWORDS: elemental, type-bound procedure, NOPASS attribute
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress
QUESTION:

Consider
  INTERFACE
    SUBROUTINE sub; END
  END INTERFACE
  TYPE t
  CONTAINS
    PROCEDURE,NOPASS :: p => sub
  END TYPE
  TYPE(t) x(100)
  CALL x%p
  END

(1) Is this program-unit standard-conforming?
    If so, how many times is SUB invoked?

(2) If SUB has the ELEMENTAL attribute, does this change its standard
    conformance?  If it is conforming, how many times is it executed?

Consider:
  TYPE t
    ...
  CONTAINS
    PROCEDURE ep => emp
  END TYPE
  ...
  ELEMENTAL SUBROUTINE emp(x)
    CLASS(t),INTENT(INOUT) :: x
    ...
  END SUBROUTINE
  ...
  TYPE(t) a(10)
  CALL a%ep

(3) Is this fragment standard-conforming, and if so, is
    "CALL a%ep" equivalent to "CALL emp(a)"?

Consider:
  INTERFACE
    ELEMENTAL SUBROUTINE esub(r); REAL,INTENT(IN) :: r; END
  END INTERFACE
  TYPE t
  CONTAINS
    PROCEDURE,NOPASS :: ep => esub
  END TYPE
  TYPE(t) x(100)
  REAL y(50)
  CALL x%ep(y)
  END

(4) Is this standard-conforming?
    If so, is ESUB invoked 50 times or 100 times?

ANSWER:
(1) No.
(2) No.
(3) Yes.
(4) No.

If the invoking object is an array, the type-bound procedure must be
elemental and have the PASS attribute.  An edit is supplied to clarify
this.

DISCUSSION:
The invoking object can only enable elementalisation if it is an actual
argument, i.e. if the type-bound procedure has the PASS attribute.  If the
type-bound procedure does not have both the PASS and ELEMENTAL attributes,
the invoking object shall be scalar.

EDITS:

[266:24+] Insert new constraint
"C1224a (R1219) If <data-ref> is an array, the referenced type-bound
        procedure shall have the PASS attribute."
