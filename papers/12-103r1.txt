NUMBER:
TITLE: STATUS of GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE
KEYWORDS: GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Assuming the processor supports environment variables, consider

  Program m197_m1
    Call Get_Environment_Variable(Name='HOME',Length=n,Status=istatus)
    Print *,istatus
    If (istatus==0) Print *,n
  End Program

If the environment variable HOME does not exist,
this program is obviously standard-conforming and prints the value 1
(STATUS paragraph of 13.7.67).

If the environment variable HOME does exist but has "no value",
this program is obviously standard-conforming and prints the value 0
(STATUS paragraph) and then prints the value 0 (LENGTH paragraph).

Aside: Indeed, if a VALUE argument is supplied, it seems that "no
       value" is the same as "zero-length value" in that no difference
       between them is discernable in a standard-conforming program.

"Inconvenience 1":
If the environment variable HOME does exist, and has a value whose
length is zero, the program appears to be not standard-conforming as
no interpretation is established: there is no specification of the
value to be assigned to the STATUS argument.  This relies on their
being a difference between "no value" and "zero-length value".

"Inconvenience 2":
If the environment variable HOME does exist, and has a value whose
length is not zero, the program is definitely not standard-conforming
as no interpretation is established w.r.t. the STATUS argument.

Thus, even though VALUE is optional, it would seem that it is not
permitted to omit it except when enquiring the existence of an
environment variable that does not exist.

Was it really intended to be impossible to enquire the existence and
length of the environment variable without attempting to fetch it?

ANSWER:

No, this was not intended.  An edit is supplied to correct this.

EDIT:

[351:18] After "either has no value" change "or" to a comma.
         After "assigned to VALUE,"
         insert "or the VALUE argument is not present,".
