Subject: Raise then enable halting => halt?

Here is a draft response for F03/0034, with thanks to Malcolm Cohen
for his help.

NUMBER:  F03/0041
TITLE:  IEEE halting and exceptions
KEYWORDS: IEEE-754, trapping, exception
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: For consideration

QUESTION:

If a specific Floating-Point (FP) exception flag is raised, and
then HALTING for that FP exception is enabled for the first
time, does the program halt?  Or, must the specific FP exception
happen after the halting is enabled for the program to halt?
Section 14.5 [368:1-8] does not answer the question.

ANSWER:

Section 14.5 states "Halting is not precise and may occur
any time after the exception has occurred." It is therefore
processor dependent as to when, if ever, the program
halts.

EDITS: None.
