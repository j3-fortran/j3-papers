Subject: usage error in list

Reference: 17-007r2

1. Discussion

Item (1) in the list of classes of entities [514:4] (19.3.1 Classes
of local identifiers) contains a usage error some texts call a
"comma splice".  Item (1) begins

      (1)  except for statement or construct entities (19.4), named
           variables, named constants, named procedure pointers, ...

The exclusion "except for statement or construct entities (19.4)"
appears to be part of the following list until the end of the list.
Moving the exclusion from item (1) to the start of the sentence makes
the sentence easier to read and does not change its meaning.

Edits are provided.

2. Edits to 17-007r2

[514:3] 19.3.1 Classes of local identifiers, p1
        Replace "entities in the classes" with
        "entities, other than statement or construct entities, in
         the classes".

[514:4] 19.3.1 Classes of local identifiers, p1
        Delete "except for statement or construct entities (19.4),".

        "Identifiers of entities, other than statement or
         construct entities, in the classes

             (1) named variables, named constants, named procedure
                 pointers, ..."
