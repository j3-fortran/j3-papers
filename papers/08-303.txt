In public comment a request was made by multiple parties
for a TYPE_IS_EXTENSIBLE intrinsic.
A library designer who does not know what types the user 
will impose upon his interface might want improved control
over user input, which may come from a source external
to the program, when using unlimited polymorphic objects
together with SAME_TYPE_AS() or EXTENDS_TYPE_OF().

The committee suggests that the SELECT TYPE construct may 
provide a useful way to supply such improved control.  SELECT 
TYPE permits designing different cases for different extensible 
types, in which case the default case can supply processing for 
the non-extensible types.  It will not be possible to distinguish 
between different non-extensible derived types in this way; 
however, that would not be possible with a TYPE_IS_EXTENSIBLE
intrinsic either so the committee presumes that this is not
requested functionality.

The behavior of EXTENDS_TYPE_OF and SAME_TYPE_AS when applied to
unlimited polymorphic entities has been clarified to allow those
to be used even when the dynamic type of the arguments is not
extensible.
