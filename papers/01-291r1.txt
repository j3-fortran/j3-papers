NUMBER: 000071
TITLE: Character array constructors
KEYWORDS: Character, array constructor, zero-size
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:
The f95 standard appears to leave the length of zero-sized character
array constructors undefined.  The penultimate paragraph of clause
4.5 says

  "The type and parameters of an array constructor are those of the
   <ac-value> expressions."

If there are no elements, then the values of the type parameters
might not be defined.  The type and kind are always well defined at
compile time.  However, the length parameter for zero-sized character
array constructors is not obviously well-defined, even at run-time.

Zero-sized constructors are certainly allowed, as mentioned in the
antipenultimate paragraph of clause 4.5:

  "An empty sequence forms a zero-sized rank-one array."

Experimentation with different f90 compilers yields varying results.

QUESTION 1:
Is the following a valid program and, if so, what len value does it
print?

  program zero
    write (*,*) len( (/ ('abc', i = 1 , 0) /) )
  end

QUESTION 2:
Is the following a valid program and, if so, what value does it print?

    program zero_size
      integer :: n = 0
      call sub('abcdefghij', n)
    contains
      subroutine sub(string, n)
        character*(*) :: string
        integer :: n
        integer :: i
        write (*,*) len( (/ (string(:i+2), i = 1 , n) /) )
      end subroutine
    end program zero_size

QUESTION 3:
Is the following a valid program and, if so, what values does it print
for the lengths and for n_calls?

    program zero_size
      integer :: n = 0
      integer :: n_calls = 0
      call sub('abcdefghij', n)
      write (*,*) 'n_calls = ', n_calls
    contains
      subroutine sub(string, n)
        character*(*) :: string
        integer :: n
        integer :: i
        write (*,*) len( (/ (string(:f(i)), i = 1 , n), 'abcde' /) )
      end subroutine sub
      integer function f(i)
        f = 2*i + 5
        n_calls = n_calls + 1
      end function f
    end program zero_size

QUESTION 4:
Is this character array constructor valid?
   (/ ('ABC'(:J/2), J=4,2) /)

ANSWER:
(1) Yes.  The length is 3.
    Clause 4.5 says that
       "The type and type parameters of an array constructor are
        those of the <ac-value> expressions."
    There is no exclusion for <ac-value>s that contribute no elements
    to the value of the array constructor: thus <ac-value>s that are
    inside zero-trip implied DO loops still contribute their "type"
    information.

    The example array constructor has an <ac-value> that is the
    character literal 'abc'; this clearly has the character length of
    3 and therefore the array constructor has a character length of 3.

    The description of how an <ac-value> that is an implied DO is
    handled confuses syntax and semantics: an edit is supplied to
    clarify this.

(2) No, the <ac-value> has an indeterminate character length and so cannot
    satisfy the requirement for the lengths to be the same.  The edits below
    clarify this situation.
(3) No, one <ac-value> has an indeterminate character length and so cannot
    satisfy the requirement for the lengths to be the same.
(4) No, the <ac-value> has an indeterminate character length.

EDITS:

In clause 4.5, in the paragraph beginning
   "If an <ac-value> is a scalar expression"
[46:1] replace:
   "an <ac-value> sequence"
with
   "a sequence of elements".

[45:38+] Add to end of paragraph:
"The character length of an ac-value in an <ac-implied-do> whose iteration
 count is zero shall not depend on the value of the implied DO variable and
 shall not depend on the value of an expression that is not an initialization
 expression."

{NOTE TO J3/WG5:
 This satisfies Henry's final anomaly with the previous answer, as
      (/ (V,I=1,0) /)
 and
      (/ (/ (V,I=1,0) /) /)
 are now both allowed.  It also satisfies one of Kurt's many objections,
 though perhaps not the others.}
