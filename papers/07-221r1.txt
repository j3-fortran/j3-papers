Discussion:

During plenary we noticed several problems with OPEN with a team of
more than one images:

1) The text requires that the values for all <connect-spec>s be the
same, which is too restrictive for output specs such as IOSTAT.

2) The intention has always been that if an error condition occurs
on one of the images of the team all images get an error. The error
message or status does not have to be the same, however, we should
not allow some images to continue and some to fail with an error. This
should be made clear in normative text. Similar considerations apply
to NEWUNIT.

If no IOSTAT is specified and an error occurs on one of the images
then error termination is initiated which brings all images down so
there is no problem there.

Edits:

[219:40-41] Replace the first sentence with:
"If no error occurs during the execution of the OPEN statement,
the variable is defined with a processor determined NEWUNIT value
that is the same on all images in the connect team."

[221:17] Delete "The team shall include the executing image." since
this is ensured by the changes to FORM_TEAM in paper J3/07-208r1.

[221:19] Delete ", and no others,"

[221:20] Replace "<connect-spec>s" with: "<connect-spec>s, except for
ERR=, IOMSG=, IOSTAT=, NEWUNIT=, and TEAM=."

[254:5] Add a sentence after the first sentence: "If an error
condition occurs during execution of an OPEN or CLOSE statement on any
of the images in the connect team, an error condition occurs on all
images in the connect team."
