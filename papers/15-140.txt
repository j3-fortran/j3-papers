The editor objects that the example of randon_init()
does not match the normative text, and that there are
issues with the normative text.

This paper attempts to repair these oversights.

Edits:

{repair the normative text}

[386:29] replace "set by calls"
         "with would be set by a call"
         replace "other images of the program"
         with "another image".

{this makes the sentence read . . ., the seed accessed by the
pseudorandom number generator is set to a processor-dependent
value that is distinct from the value that would be set by calls
to RANDOM_INIT in another image.}

{repair example}

[386:32] replace "other images use distinct seeds" with
"the sequence generated will differ from that of another image".
