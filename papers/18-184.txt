Ballot Comment
--------------

In their DIS Ballot for draft N2146 of Fortran 2018, the JP comment
066 reads:

"The following item is missing: whether the processor has the ability
to detect that an image has failed (11.5, 16.10.2.26);"

with the suggested edit:

It should be added.


Discussion
----------

The processor dependency really originates in 16.10.2.26
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, where we have "If the processor has the ability to
detect that an image has failed,...". The FAIL IMAGE statement in 11.5
is not conditional.  So the edit should be ordered in A.2 according to
the citation 16.10.2.6.


Edit to N2146
-------------

[536:3+] In A.2 Processor dependencies, after the entry "the values
returned by the functions COMPILER_OPTIONS ..." insert a new entry:

"whether the processor has the ability to detect that an image has
failed (16.10.2.26);"
