Unresolved issue 149 [259:18-21] is a place holder to allow sequence assocation
that involves a change in character length for characters of kind C_CHAR.
Currently, sequence association involving a change in character length is only
permitted for characters of default kind, and C_CHAR isn't necessarily the same
as the default kind.

To remedy this, we'll specify that characters of kind C_CHAR occupy contiguous
unspecified storage units and generalize the description of sequence
association involving characters.

[259:14]
  After "of type default character"
  add   ", of type character with the C character kind (16.1),"

[259:18-21] Delete J3 note 149.

[261:7]
  Change "or a scalar of type default character"
  to     "a scalar of type default character, or a scalar of type character
          with the C character kind (16.1)"

[261:11]
  After "default character"
  add   "or of type character with the C character kind,"

[261:12]
  Change "character storage units"
  to     "storage units"

[261:14]
  Change "character storage units"
  to     "storage units"

[261:15]
  Change "character storage units"

  After "default character"
  add   "or of type character with the C character kind,"

[261:18]
  Change "character storage units"
  to     "storage units"

[353:33-34]
  Delete item (3).  (It's implied by item (4)).

[353:36]
  Change "character storage units"
  to     "<<character storage units>>"

[353:41-43]
  Move item (6) before [353:37], and renumber it as (5).

[353:37-40]
  Replace the current item (5) with the following two items, and renumber the
  remaining items.
    "(6) A nonpointer scalar object of type character with the C character
         kind (16.1) and character length <len> occupies <len> contiguous
         <<unspecified storage units>>;

     (7) A nonpointer scalar object of any type not specified in items (1)-(6)
         occupies a single unspecified storage unit that is different for each
         case and each set of type parameter values, and that is different from
         the unspecified storage units of item (6);"

[386:6]
  Add a new sentence
    "The value of C_CHAR is known as the <<C character kind>>."

[386:38+]
  Add new paragraph to Note 16.3
    "For example, given a C function with a prototype like the following

       void copy(char in[], char out[]);

     it can be declared and used in a Fortran program as follows.

       USE ISO_C_BINDING
       INTERFACE
         BIND(C) SUBROUTINE COPY(IN, OUT)
           USE ISO_C_BINDING
           CHARACTER(KIND=C_CHAR), DIMENSION(*) :: IN, OUT
         END SUBROUTINE COPY
       END INTERFACE

       CHARACTER(LEN=10, KIND=C_CHAR) ::                                    &
      &        DIGIT_STRING = C_CHAR_'123456789' // C_NULL_CHAR
       CHARACTER(KIND=C_CHAR) :: DIGIT_ARR(10)

       CALL COPY(DIGIT_STRING, DIGIT_ARR)
       PRINT '(1X, A1)', DIGIT_ARR
       END"

Unresolved issue 120 [387:1-10] points out that there is no restriction on the
length parameter of a character dummy that prevents it from being assumed.

[386:29-30] Replace the sentence that begins

     "In the case of character type, . . . ."

  with
    "Furthermore, a Fortran entity of type character does not interoperate
     with any C entity unless its length is omitted or is specified by an
     expression that is an initialization expression whose value is one."
