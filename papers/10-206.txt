DISCUSSION

It is stated in 5.2.6.2 of 10-165r2 that CFI_allocate uses the same
mechanism as the Fortran ALLOCATE statement, but the conditions are not
the same. Similarly, it is stated in 5.2.6.3 that CFI_deallocate uses
the same mechanism at the Fortran DEALLOCATE statement, but the
conditions are not the same. Edits are proposed to correct this.

Furthermore, an edit is proposed to allow the DEALLOCATE statement to
deallocate a pointer target that was allocated by CFI_allocate.

A note is proposed to explain the purpose of the state member of
CFI_cdesc_t.

Tobias Burnus has requested that CFI_cdesc_t have a member that
indicates whether a pointer is associated with a target that may be
deallocated. A simple change to the state member is provided for this
but there is an argument against it - there is likely overhead for
setting the state in a call to a C function that makes no use of the
information. For this reason, it is separated from the other edits.

Malcolm Cohen suggests eliminating the state member. He says "Just
requiring the address field to be non-null would be sufficient, and
nicer to use.  Whether the underlying Fortran implementation uses
a null address for zero-sized allocations or not, the right thing
to do is to hide the processor dependency from the user, not expose
it." Alternative edits for this are provided.


EDITS to 10-165r2:

[9:36+] After the list of components of CFI_cdesc_t add
   NOTE
   The value NULL for the base_addr component does not necessarily
   indicate that an allocatable is not allocated since it may be
   allocated and of size zero. Similarly, the value NULL for the
   base_addr component does not necessarily indicate that a pointer
   is not pointer associated since it may be associated with a target
   of size zero.

[12:3] Change "On entry, the base address in the C descriptor shall
       be NULL. The" to "On entry, the".

[12:4] Change "disassociated" to "a".

[12:4-5] Change "The supplied" to "On successful execution of
         CFI_allocate, the supplied", and move this sentence to
         be after the sentence at [12:6] ending "... assumed to be
         one."

[12:11] Change "On entry, the base address in the C descriptor shall
       not be NULL. The" to "On entry, the".

[12:12-13] Change "that was allocated ... statement" to
     "satisfying the conditions for successful deallocation by the
     Fortran DEALLOCATE statement (6.7.3.3 of ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010)".

[13] Add a new section:

     5.3 Interaction with the DEALLOCATE statement

     The DEALLOCATE statement shall treat a pointer whose target was
     allocated using CFI_allocate in exactly the same way as if it
     were allocated using an ALLOCATE statement.


ADDITIONAL EDIT to 10-165r2:

[9:35-36] Replace by

<int state;>  has the value

   1 if the object is an allocated allocatable or a pointer associated
     with a target satisfying the conditions for successful deallocation
     by the Fortran DEALLOCATE statement (6.7.3.3 of ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010).

   2 if the object is a pointer that is otherwise associated with a
     target or is of assumed-shape, or

   0 otherwise.


ALTERNATIVE EDITS to 10-165r2:

Do not make the above edits for [9:36+] and [9:35-36]. Instead, make
these edits:

[9:22]. Replace
"If the object has zero size, the value is processor-dependent."
by
"If the object has zero size, the value is not NULL but is otherwise
processor dependent."

[9:35-36]. Delete the lines for int state.
