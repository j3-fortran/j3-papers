News
----
OpenACC 3.4 was released at ISC 2025. This release contains
numerous clarifications and several important user-facing
features.

* The `capture` modifier to data clauses enables developers
  to annotate that a discrete copy of data in device memory
  is required, even when on a shared/unified memory device.
* The `always`, `alwaysin`, and `alwaysout` modifiers provide
  a concise way to declare that data should always be made
  consistent between the host and device, even when data is
  already present in device memory.
* New rules were added to enable the compiler to infer
  the level of parallelism for routines in certain situations.
* The `atomic` directive now has an `if` clause to handle cases
  where different parallelization strategies may make the
  atomic operation unnecessary and potentially a performance
  bottleneck.
