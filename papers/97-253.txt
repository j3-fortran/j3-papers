TITLE:        Meaning of embedded blanks in namelist input name
KEYWORDS:     NAMELIST, optional qualification, name, input
DEFECT TYPE:  Interpretation
STATUS:	      X3J3 consideration in progress

BACKGROUND:
In running some older NAMELIST tests, a test case was encountered that has
embedded blanks within the "optional qualification" following a namelist group
object name:

    CHARACTER*10 string
    NAMELIST /junk/ string

    WRITE(9,*) ' $junk string(  :  ) = ''1234567890'' /'
    REWIND(9)
    READ(9,junk)

    IF (string .NE. '123457890') THEN
       PRINT *, 'string NE 1234567890, string = "', string, '"'
       PRINT *, 'String test FAILED'
    ELSE
       PRINT *, 'String test PASSED'
    END IF

    END

While studying the standard to determine if the above program was standard-
conforming or not, some questions arose about the use of "name" and embedded
blanks in the namelist section 10.9.1.1.  Among them were:  Since a blank is
a delimiter, should it be allowed to be embedded in a variety of places in a
namelist input record that are not currently described by the standard?  Do
we want to strain namelist input scanning more than a reasonable amount?

In normal Fortran terminology, the term "name" does not include  subobject
qualification.  In section 2.5.1 Name and designator, lines 2 through 5, the
standard states:

  A name is used to identify a program constituent, such as a program
  unit, named variable, named constant, dummy argument, or derived type.
  The rules governing the construction of names are given in 3.2.1.  A
  subobject designator is a name followed by one or more of the
  following:  component selectors, array section, array element selectors,
  and substring selectors.

In section 10.9.1 Namelist Input, lines 13 to 16, the standard states:

  In each name-value subsequence, the name shall be the name of a
  namelist group list item with an optional qualification and the name
  with the optional qualification shall not be a zero-sized array,
  a zero-sized array section, or a zero-length character string.  The
  optional qualification, if any, shall not contain a vector subscript.

In section 10.9.1.1 Namelist group object names, lines 32 and 33, the
standard states:

  The name in the input record may be preceded and followed by one or
  more optional blanks but shall not contain embedded blanks.

QUESTION:

(1) Does Section 2.5.1 mean that the optional qualification described in the
    10.9.1 is not part of the name for namelist input?

    If the optional qualification is not part of the name, there seem to be
    no rules for where blanks and end-of-record may occur within the optional
    qualification.

    Also note that size of the name and the optional qualification together
    may be longer than the size of an input record if there are multiple levels
    of structure component qualification in a structure component reference.


(2) Are embedded blanks allowed within substring and subscript qualifications
    in the namelist input?  May an END-OF-RECORD occur in these same places?

(3) More specifically, are embedded blanks/END-OF-RECORD allowed in the
    following places in namelist input?

   1.  Between the name and the left parenthesis of either a substring or
       subscript qualification?

           e.g.,  string (3:4)  =  '123'

   2.  Between tokens within the parenthesized qualifier?

           e.g.,  string( 3:4)  =  '123'
           e.g.,  string( 3:4 )  =  '123'
           e.g.,  string( 3: 4 )  =  '123'
           e.g.,  string( 3 : 4 )  =  '123'

           e.g.,  string(  :  )  =  '123'

   3.  Between the two sets of parentheses for array and substring notation?

           e.g.,  string (  :  )  (  :  ) =  '123'

   6.  Within the two subscripts or start and end values themselves?

           e.g.,  string ( 2 0 : 3 0 )  =  '123'

(4) Are embedded blanks allowed within a reference to a structure?  May an
END-OF-RECORD occur within this reference?

           e.g.,  LONG__NAME % LEVEL1 ( 2 0 : 3 0 ) % string = '123'

(5) Section 10.9.1.1, lines 32 and 33 currently state:

      The name in the input record may be preceded and followed by one or
      more optional blanks but shall not contain embedded blanks.

    Should the above lines have an addition along the following lines:

      Blanks shall not precede the left parenthesis of a substring or subscript
      qualification.  Blanks may follow the left parenthesis or precede the
      right parenthesis of the substring or subscript qualification but shall
      not be embedded within the subscript or substring themselves.  The end
      of record shall not occur within any part of the substring or subscript
      qualification.  Blanks may occur between a subscript and a substring
      qualification.

    Note to committee:

      The above addition will then allow (  :  )  and ( 2:3 ) but will not
      allow  (  1 0 : 2 0 ).  Blanks will be allowed in between the subscript
      and substring reference:  ( 1:2 ) ( 3:4 ).

    The following change is harder.  If the derived type qualification is so
    long that it will not fit in one record, there are two choices that come
    to mind:

      * state that the input record must be long enough to contain the entire
        reference

      * allow the user to break up the structure reference to be able to
        specify it within an input record.

    The latter ability could be added to the standard via additional text along
    the following lines:

      Blanks shall not be embedded within the optional qualification provided
      for a structure reference.  However, an end-of-record may occur after
      a percent (%) separator in an input record.  The name may continue in
      the next record.

    This will allow a break at such places as:

         LONG__NAME%LEVEL1(20:30)%EOR
         string = '123'

    where EOR stands for end-of-record.
