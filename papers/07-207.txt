Discussion

1. We agree that there needs to be a reference to 2.3.6 in CLOSE.

2. We have rechecked all the places in the standard that refer to
termination and found one place where an edit is desirable.

3. We do not see what change to CLOSE is being suggested.

4. Synchronizations will be needed during the completion step if
files are connected on different teams. A possible implementation is
to perform a SYNC ALL for each file.
