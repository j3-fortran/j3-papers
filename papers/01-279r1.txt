The proposed actions are marked by >> after each item.

1)  Page 23, Second note 3.1; change "NAME_LENGTH" to "Name_Length" to 
give an example of required lower case.
>> Page 23:9 "NAME_LENGTH" => "Name_Length"

2)  Page 23, R308, C302 etc.  We have a ton of rules of the form
     R308    int-constant    is    constant
     C302    int-constant shall be of type integer
would it be possible to put those up into the generic rules in section
1?  Or did we do this in 3.2.2?  R308 and R309 seem unrelated to
anything else maybe this is what we did here.  I couldn't find
int-constant in most other chapters
>> NO

3)  Page 26, 3.3.1.2  Is it worth saying that the ";" is not part of the
statement?  Might apply to earlier restriction that a labeled statement
must have a non blank character.  Is
999    ;    ! legal?
>> Defer for between meeting paper

4)  Page 26, 3.3.1.1.  We don't appear to cover a line like
       a = 3;
nothing is said about what follows the ;
same thing applies to 3.3.2.1 for fixed form
>> Defer for between meeting paper

5)  Page 26, 3.3.1.3 second line.  Change "comment lines shall not be
continued" to "Comment lines cannot be continued".  There is no way to
continue a comment line.  The shall implies that there is a (syntactic)
way to do it, but the programmer isn't allowed to do it.
>> 26:25 Change "shall not be continued" to "cannot be continued"

6)  Page 27, 3.3.2.1.  We need to note that we have extended FIXED form
to allow lower case c in column 1 to indicate a comment line.  Follows
from allowing upper case C and requirement that lower maps to upper.
Add "c" to "C" or "*" and commatise the list
>> 27:43 and 27:40.5  Add ', "c",' after "C"

7)  Page 27, 3.3.2.3, last line.  same comment about comment lines shall
not be continued
>> 27:41 Change "shall not be continued" to "cannot be continued"

8)  Page 28, 3.3.2.4., second line.   What does "on the same line" refer
to?  The initial line referred to in the first sentence of the
paragraph?  If so that would allow

99999 Print *,
      1        list    ;  234  continue
>> NO
