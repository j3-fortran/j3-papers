Subject: UTI 149, INT/REAL with boz argument
Date: 2008 January 25
References: J3/08-007


Discussion for UTI 149, page 390:

In the description of the result of INT(boz), the scope of what is
processor dependent is larger than what was the case for f03.  In
addition, the description needs to be modified to take into account
the padding and truncation of the boz argument that may take place.
The padding and truncation modification is also needed for
REAL. Finally, the processor dependence part of REAL is overly
restrictive, and should be symmetric with the INT case.


Edits to J3/08-007:

[390:35] In the final Case of the Result Value section of 13.7.81
INT(A [,KIND]), at the end of the first sentence, add

", as possibly modified by padding or truncation (13.3.3)".


[390:35] At the beginning of the final sentence of this same
paragraph, replace "The" with "If this bit pattern does not correspond
to any value of such a variable, the".


[416:26] In the final Case of the Result Value section of 13.7.136
REAL(A [,KIND]), at the end of the first sentence, add

", as possibly modified by padding or truncation (13.3.3)".


[416:26] At the beginning of the final sentence of this same
