This is the same assumed shape paper, for doneness.
The idea got a Hate .. Love vote of 0 - 0 - 11 - 1 at M167.

Title: same shape dummy argument arrays

Submitted By: J3

Status: For Consideration

References: J3/04-136

Basic Functionality: Provide a specification to guarantee that several
                     dummy argument assumed shape arrays have the same
                     shape.

Rationale: Compilers will be able to generate more efficient code when
           they can assume that several arrays all have the same assumed
           shape.  It is also a convenience to programmers, although perhaps
           a minor one.

Estimated Impact: the effort was estimated as 5 on the John Reid scale at 167.

Detailed Specification: Given several array dummy arguments to a procedure,
                        provide a notation to indicate that the corresponding
                        actual arguments all have the same shape.  One way
                        to do this is to define an alternative to the DIMENSION
                        attribute, say, SHAPE(A), where a is a previously
                        defined dummy argument.  For example,

                        real, dimension(:,:,:) :: a
                        real, shape(a) :: b

                        Of course, other spellings are possible,
                        and may be desirable.
