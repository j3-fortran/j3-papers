MEETING ROOM

NEN will make a meeting room for up to 20 persons available to
WG5 for the week May 9-13, 2005.

There is a space for subgroups near the meeting room, and if
necessary, there is an extra office we could use. We will be able to
print. A flipover is available, and a beamer will be reserved for the
meeting. Coffee will be available throughout the day. NEN has proposed
to pay for lunches in the cafeteria of the building. If we want drinks
and snacks during the meeting, we will need to take care of it
ourselves. This means buying a crate of soft drinks and snacks, like
is done in Las Vegas. We would need to ask for a contribution of
attendees at the start of the meeting.

HOTELS

There are several hotels within 5-10 minutes walk of the central Delft
train station. See below for details.

Rooms have been reserved at two hotels near the station, thus within
walking distance of each other. There is also a web site for hotels in
Delft: http://www.delfthotels.nl, where meeting attendees can reserve
rooms at other hotels.

We reserved 10 rooms for single occupancy and 10 rooms for double
occupancy at Hotel Coen. The deadline for reservations is April 8,

TRANSPORTATION

There is a train connection from Schiphol airport to Delft central
station. You need to change once, either at Leiden, or at the
Hague. You can find the times on the train web site described below.

The English web site for trains in the Netherlands is found as
follows:

Go to http://www.ns.nl
Click on 'English'

The NEN building is 5 minutes walk from the train station Delft
Zuid. The connection between Delft and Delft Zuid is very good. There
is a train every 15 minutes, and the trip takes 5 minutes. There is
also a bus every 15 minutes, which takes 8 minutes to get to Delft
Zuid. If a meeting attendee prefers to stay in the Hague or Rotterdam,
that is also possible, as there is a frequent direct train connection
to these cities.

RESTAURANTS

There is also a web site for restaurants in Delft:
http://www.delftrestaurants.nl. There is a wide variety of choice.

TOURIST NOTE

The film on Vermeer 'The Girl with a Pearl Earring'
recently came out, and this film gives an impression of old-style
Delft. Delft is famous for its blue pottery. The Keukenhof with the
tulip fields will be open during May. See also
