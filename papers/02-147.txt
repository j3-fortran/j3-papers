From: Kurt W. Hirchert                  (Meeting 160) 26 Feb 2002

==========
Background
==========

As a result of comments made during a discussion at meeting 159,
Van Snyder and I were given the task of devising a replacement
for the IMPORT statement.  The resulting rough proposal was
presented in 01-397.  01-400 provided information on the
motivations for the proposal.  This document provides the formal
specifications, syntax, and edits for this proposal.

==============
Specifications
==============

Completely remove from language the IMPORT statement (a mechanism
for selective host association into an interface body from the
scoping unit immediately containing it).  In its place, introduce
a mechanism to specify whether the specifications in an interface
body are to be interpreted as though they appeared in an external
procedure (no host association) or in a module procedure (host
associate directly from the module).  To maintain Fortran 90
design goals about text reuse, the specification of this mechanism
should appear outside the text of the interface body.  To maintain
compatibility with Fortran 90/95, the default for this mechanism
should be that the interface body is interpreted as though it were
an external procedure.

{* It might be interesting to bring back the IMPORT statement as a
mechanism for selective host association into _any_ scoping unit,
but that is not a part of this proposal. *}

======
Syntax
======

The syntax to (explicitly) specify that an interface body is to
be interpreted as though it were an external procedure is
  CONTEXT EXTERNAL
The syntax to specify that an interface body is to be interpreted
as though it were a module procedure is
  CONTEXT MODULE [<module-name>]
This latter syntax is permitted only when the interface body is
contained (directly or indirectly) in the module in question.
The CONTEXT statement appears in the interface block before the
interface bodies to which it applies.  A CONTEXT statement
remains in effect until a subsequent CONTEXT statement appears
or the end of the interface block is reached.

=====
Edits
=====

9:39 Delete entire line ("[<import-stmt>] ...")

88:27 After "interface body", insert "in external context
       (12.3.2.1)".  {* We want IMPLICIT to respect our
       CONTEXT mechanism. *}

88:28 Replace "internal or module procedure" with "internal
       procedure, module procedure, or interface body in
       module context".

244:11+ Insert " or <context-stmt>"

245:6-8 Delete the existing R1209, C1209, and C1210, and insert
        the following replacement text:
"
R1209a <context-stmt> is CONTEXT <context>
R1209b <context> is EXTERNAL
                 or MODULE [<module-name>]
C1209a (R1209b) The <context> shall not be MODULE unless the
        <context-stmt> is which it appears is contained (directly
	or indirectly) in a module and is not contained in an
	interface body in external context.
C1209b (R1209b) The <module-name>, if present, shall be the name
        of the module in which the <context-stmt> is contained.
"

245:31-35 Delete the entire paragraph (describing IMPORT) and
        insert the following replacement text:
"
The CONTEXT statement provides a context for the interpretation of
interface bodies that follow it in the interface block but precede
any subsequent CONTEXT statement.  If the CONTEXT statement is a
CONTEXT MODULE statement, the affected interface bodies are in
<<module context>>, and they have access by host association to
the entities of the module in which they appear.  If the CONTEXT
statement is a CONTEXT EXTERNAL statement, the affected interface
bodies are in <<external context>>, and they have no host
association.  Interface bodies which have no preceding CONTEXT
statement also are in external context.

NOTE:
The context of an interface body affects only the interpretation
of the statements contained in it.  There is no required
connection to whether the procedure being described actually is
an external procedure or a module procedure.
"

246:Note_12.6:
        In the first line, replace "IMPORT" with "CONTEXT MODULE".
        After the "INTERFACE" line, insert "CONTEXT MODULE".
        2 lines later, delete the "IMPORT T" line.
	In the last line, replace "IMPORT" with "CONTEXT MODULE".

387:9 After "interface body", insert "in module context".

387:10 Replace "its host ... interface body" with "the module that
        directly or indirectly contains it".

                               - end -
