Subject: Procedure Actual Argument and Procedure Pointer Dummy
Date: 2016 June 06

Reference: 10-007r1,16-007r1

Fortran 2008 introduced a feature allowing a non-pointer actual argument
to be passed to a pointer dummy argument. The data pointer case is
described in 12.5.2.7p2:

"If the dummy argument does not have the INTENT (IN), the actual argument
shall be a pointer. Otherwise, the actual argument shall be a pointer or
a valid target for the dummy pointer in a pointer assignment statement.
If the actual argument is not a pointer, the dummy pointer becomes pointer
associated with the actual argument."

and is mentioned in the Introduction:

"An actual argument with the TARGET attribute can correspond to a dummy
pointer."

Furthermore, C.9.4 discusses "Pointers and targets as arguments" and
describes the case of data pointers.

However, Fortran 2008 also added the corresponding feature for procedure
pointers, as described in 12.5.2.9p5:

"If a dummy argument is a procedure pointer, the corresponding actual
argument shall be a procedure pointer, a reference to a function that
returns a procedure pointer, a reference to the intrinsic function NULL,
or a valid target for the dummy pointer in a pointer assignment
statement. If the actual argument is not a pointer, the dummy argument
shall have the INTENT (IN) and becomes pointer associated with the actual
argument."

This new feature is not mentioned in the introduction, nor is it covered
in C.9.4. (16-007 corrects the grammar in the last sentence of
12.5.2.9p5.)

As there will be no more Corrigenda for Fortran 2008, it is unnecessary
to process an interpretation request for this. Since the procedure case
is not new in Fortran 2015, it doesn't need to be added to its
Introduction, but C.9.4 needs edits to include it.

Edits to 16-007r1

[576:14] In C.9.4 Pointers and targets as arguments, p1,
         After "declared to be a pointer" insert a comma,
         after "could be a pointer" remove the comma.
{Unrelated wordsmithing.}

[576:15] Same paragraph,
         After "a nonpointer variable" insert "or procedure".

The sentence now reads:
  "If a dummy argument is declared to be a pointer, the corresponding
   actual argument could be a pointer or could be a nonpointer
   variable or procedure."

[576:21] Same paragraph, Case (ii),
         After "TARGET attribute" insert "or is a procedure,".

The sentence now reads:
  "This only occurs when the actual argument has the TARGET attribute or
   is a procedure, and the dummy argument has the INTENT (IN) attribute."
