Discussion
----------

13.7.1p2 says that the descriptions of arguments of intrinsic procedures
describe the actual arguments.  In some cases there are specifications
that are surely intended to apply to those arguments when viewed as dummy
arguments of the procedures, such as the SIZE argument of RANDOM_SEED
being an INTENT(OUT) argument.  Given the specification in 13.7.1p2, this
could be construed to be a severely-restrictive requirement on the actual
argument.

[316:1-2] says "The dummy arguments of the intrinsic procedures in 13.7
have INTENT (IN) if the intent is not stated explicitly." so we can delete
those statements.

Edits are also included for sections 14 and 15 for consistency.

[408:5] says "All dummy arguments have INTENT (IN) if the intent is not
stated explicitly." about the procedures in 14.11.
