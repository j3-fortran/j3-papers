1. Introduction
---------------

This paper attempts to pull together the various requirements of MPI-3 and
others for C interoperability that have been so far inadequately addressed
by the draft TR.

There are a number of technical choices in the design.  These could be
changed, but the edits would need further work in that case.


2. Requirements summary
-----------------------

(1) Support for passing assumed-size arrays to assumed-rank arguments.
    Due to historical reasons, existing MPI code makes much use of
    assumed-size arrays, and due to the way generic overloading works,
    for maximum usefulness with minimal code changes it is required to
    pass these to assumed-rank dummies.

(2) Support for CHARACTER(*) dummy arguments in BIND(C) routines.
    Again, the existing facilities (basically passing to CHARACTER(*)
    arrays and passing the length as a separate explicit argument,
    or appending a NUL character to each argument - or element in
    the case of array arguments) would require excessive code changes
    to MPI code.  It seems to be the desire to have all of TYPE(*) and
    DIMENSION(..) and CHARACTER(*) in the same interface that is driving
    this issue.

(3) Actual arguments that are not otherwise interoperable should be
    considered interoperable with a TYPE(*) argument, except for derived
    types with type-bound procedures, final procedures, or type
    parameters.

For further discussion of the background behind these requirements see
10-237 (omitted from the r1).


3. Technical Choices
--------------------

It is taken as a principle that needs no explanation that permission to
perform such actions as passing assumed-size to assumed-rank dummies not
be restricted to BIND(C) procedures with extremely good reasons for such
an inconsistency.

(1) Assumed-size and assumed-rank.

    It must be possible to discover from C that a CFI_cdesc_t* formal
    parameter is associated with an assumed-size array.  This COULD be
    done with a new CFI_attribute_t value.

    As a matter of principle, it should be possible to discover this
    directly from Fortran without resorting to a C wrapper to enquire
    the CFI_cdesc_t value.

    Furthermore, in Fortran the LBOUND, UBOUND, SHAPE, and SIZE intrinsics
    can be applied to assumed-rank arguments.  The semantics of these need
    to be properly defined when the association is with an assumed-size
    dummy argument.

    Note that an assumed-size array could be described as having an
    "undefined" extent in its final dimension.

    Therefore, this proposal specifies:
    (a) that the UBOUND of the final dimension of an assumed-size array be
        2 less than its LBOUND.

        Note that for a zero extent dimension, LBOUND=1 and UBOUND=0.
        It would be perfectly reasonable for an undefined extent dimension
        to be LBOUND=1 and UBOUND=-1.  It is also be reasonable to pass the
        actual lower bound.

        Since LBOUND of an assumed-size array returns the actual lower
        bound, for simplicity we will say the same of an assumed-rank
        argument that is associated (at some level of argument association
        with an assumed-size array).

    (b) For the convenience of the C programmer, a new CFI_attribute_t
        value will also be chosen?

    The alternative to using UBOUND in this was to indicate would be to
    add a new intrinsic inquiry IS_ASSUMED_SIZE(variable) and to forbid
    inquiry of the upper bound or size of the final dimension when this
    returns true; this seems far more intrusive and harder to use than
    the UBOUND=LBOUND-2 solution.

(2) CHARACTER(*)

    The obvious implementation choices are to pass the length separately,
    or to include it in CFI_cdesc_t either as an extra member in the
    struct, or as an extra (first) dimension.

    Passing the length separately might appear to have the advantage that
    many processors use this method for intra-Fortran calls with
    CHARACTER(*): this is an illusion though, as different processors vary
    as to the size and position (and presence!) of this hidden argument.

    We also want to have well-defined results when the user passes a
    CHARACTER(LEN/=1) actual argument to a TYPE(*) dummy - it is not
    exactly a surprise that some want to pass CHARACTER data in messages.

    Given the existence of multibyte character sets, the length member of
    CFI_cdesc_t should indicate not the character length but the size of an
    individual character.

    The disadvantage of dimension-fiddling is that this reduces the
    effective maximum rank of a CHARACTER actual argument from 15 to 14.
    This is not considered to be an actual hardship, but if it were,
    adding an extra member to CFI_cdesc_t (NOT using "length"!) would be
    the preferred solution.

(4) CHARACTER(:)

    MPI has not asked for support of deferred-length CHARACTER, however
    from personal experience with modules interfacing to C libraries
    that return variable-length character strings I can say that this
    would be very useful.

    It also comes "for free" with inclusion of character length in
    CFI_cdesc_t, and is particularly easy with the dimension-fiddling
    version.

(3) TYPE(*) and interoperability of arguments

    Interoperability of derived types with type-bound procedures or final
    procedures is probably not technically difficult at all, but might be
    "philosophically" difficult.  This paper does not propose to address
    this at this time (one cannot build Rome in a day).

    Derived types with type parameters would however pose difficult
    implementation issues with CFI_cdesc_t so they should probably not
    be reconsidered at a future date.

    For other normally-non-interoperable types, this feature is "a mere
    matter of exposition".  It is, however, slightly tricky, and the
    wording suggested will probably need careful review, probably at a
    later date.

(5) I take it as a matter of principle that passing an assumed-size
    array to a C routine via a DIMENSION(..) argument has identical
    effect to passing it to a Fortran routine with DIMENSION(..) and
    then to a C routine with DIMENSION(..).

(6) CHARACTER(LEN=?)

    With allocatable and pointer arguments, and character length/=1 via
    dimension fiddling we get the C routine being able to change the
    character length.  The obvious way to cope with that is to require the
    Fortran one to be changeable too, i.e. CHARACTER(LEN=:).  Note that
    this is ONLY for ALLOCATABLE and POINTER arguments.

    There is no real objection to allowing CHARACTER(LEN=something else)
    for ALLOCATABLE or POINTER, but to enable robust code writing we would
    then want to have some way to enquire whether the CHARACTER length was
    changeable.  I believe that in general people doing this will either
    want to have true variable (i.e. deferred) character length, or won't
    mind doing a single additional pointer assignment if they don't want
    deferred length in the rest of their program.


4. High-level Proposal Summary
------------------------------

(1) An assumed-size array may be used as an actual argument to an
    assumed-rank dummy.

(2) The UBOUND of an assumed-rank array is defined to be LBOUND-2.
    The SIZE of that dimension is defined to be -1, making the SIZE of
    the whole thing negative unless zero-sized.

(3) A dummy argument of a BIND(C) routine of type CHARACTER may have
    CHARACTER(LEN=*) iff (if and only if) it is assumed-rank.

(4) A dummy argument of a BIND(C) routine of type CHARACTER may have
    CHARACTER(LEN=:) iff it is assumed-rank.

(5) Any type/kind/length of actual argument is interoperable with
    TYPE(*), except for derived types with final procedures, type-bound
    procedures, or type parameters.

    The interoperability with otherwise non-interoperable types however is
    limited to copying and use as arguments (and targets).


5. Edits to 10-165r2
--------------------

[2:2] "is" -> "specifies".
{EDITORIAL: It doesn't describe all the unchanged stuff from 1539-1, so
 although it specifies an "upwardly compatible" (whatever that means)
 extension, it is not in itself the extended 1539-1.}

[3:10+] 2.1p2+, insert new text:
  "An assumed-type object is unlimited polymorphic.

   \begin{UTI}[TR1]
   Note that "unlimited polymorphic" just means that its dynamic type is
   not limited.  It does not mean that it is CLASS(*), or can be used
   everywhere that CLASS(*) can be used, because we already have a rule
   that limits the places that TYPE(*) can be used.

   It might prove less confusing to use a new term e.g.
   "unknown polymorphic" but that probably needs even more edits.
   \end{UTI}"
{FATAL exposition error: sorry guys, but otherwise you run slap-bang into
 contradictions.  This is the simplest fix.  It also gets us the "type
 compatible with everything" feature with no further work.}

[5:11-12] 3.2p2, replace with
  "An assumed-type dummy argument shall not correspond to an actual
   argument that is of a derived type that has type parameters, type-bound
   procedures, or final procedures."
{This restriction is required.  Here.  The restriction against type-bound
 and final procedures is probably unnecessary but that should be
 discussed.}

[5:22+5+] 3.3+, insert new subclause
  "3.4 Intrinsic procedures

   3.4.1 SHAPE

   The description of SHAPE in ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010 is changed for an
   assumed-rank array that is associated with an assumed-size array;
   an assumed-size array has no shape, but in this case the result has
   a value of
     [ (SIZE (ARRAY, I), I=1, RANK (ARRAY)) ]

   3.4.2 SIZE

   The description of SIZE in ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010 is changed in the
   following cases:
   
   - for an assumed-rank object that is associated with an assumed-size
     array, the result has a value of -1 if DIM is present and equal to
     the rank of ARRAY, and a negative value that is equal to
        PRODUCT ( [ (SIZE (ARRAY, I), I=1, RANK (ARRAY)) ] )
     if DIM is not present;

   - for an assumed-rank object that is associated with a scalar, the
     result has a value of 1.

   3.4.3 UBOUND

   The description of UBOUND in ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010 is changed for an
   assumed-rank object that is associated with an assumed-size array;
   the result has a value of LBOUND (ARRAY, RANK (ARRAY)) - 2."
{NOTE to the EDITOR: "-1" is written "$-1$" in LaTeX, and the minus sign in
 the expression immediately above is written $-$.  Note also careful
 spacing of the expressions: if there is a bad line break you can use ~
 instead of space...}
{Further note: These could instead be placed in 4 by splitting 4 into
 4.1 Changes to intrinsic procedures and 4.2 New intrinsic procedure, or
 some such, but this placement seems workable for now.}

[7:1] "Intrinsic" -> "New intrinsic".
{MINOR EDITORIAL: We do want to say stuff about existing intrinsic
 procedures elsewhere, so this is a bit misleading.}

OPTIONAL?
[9:33] Replace "or assumed-shape" by ", assumed-shape or assumed-size".

[10:12+] 5.2.3, at the end, append new text:
  "If the actual argument is of type CHARACTER, or is of assumed type
   eventually associated with an actual argument of type CHARACTER,
   the member elem_len shall contain the sizeof() of a variable of
   character length 1 of that type and kind.  The first element of member
   dim shall contain a lower bound of 1 with a stride equal to elem_len and
   upper bound equal to the character length of the actual argument; all
   other elements shall correspond to a dimension one less than for
   non-CHARACTER types.

   \begin{UTI}[TR2]
   This approach has not achieved consensus; people want the rank field
   to match the RANK intrinsic.

   The other main contenders are:
   (1) fold the character length into elem_len,
   (2) add an additional character length member.

   In any case more edits are required.
   \end{UTI}

   If any actual argument associated with the dummy argument is an
   assumed-size array, the array shall be simply contiguous, the member
   attribute shall be CFI_attribute_unknown_size and the member extent of
   the last dimension of member dim is equal to (CFI_index_t)-2."
{Actually in this case, since we are providing an "attribute" flag, I don't
 mind making it undefined.  Note casting probably not needed since we made
 this a signed integer type, but left for clarify.}

[10:24+5+] 5.2.5, table 5.1, insert new row after CFI_attribute_pointer
  "CFI_attribute_unknown_size  &  assumed-size \\".

[10:27] 5.2.5p4,
  Change "or a pointer"
  To
    ", a pointer, or associated with an assumed-size argument.
     CFI_attribute_unknown_size specifies an object that is, or is
     argument-associated with, an assumed-size dummy argument".

[12:38+] 5.2.7p2+, insert new paragraph
  "A C descriptor that describes an object of type CHARACTER shall have
   rank $\geq$ 1, and dim[0].sm = elem_len."
{The C user will be making up character stuff; require the first dimension
 to be contiguous so the Fortran doesn't get an unpleasant surprise.}

[13:14+] 5.2.8p2, item (6), insert new subitem after item (a),
  "(a2) the dummy argument is a nonallocatable, nonpointer variable of
        type CHARACTER with assumed length, and corresponds to a formal
        parameter of type CFI_cdesc_t,"
{Allow the obvious simple use of CHARACTER(*).}

[13:18+] 5.2.8p2+ insert new paragraph
  "If a dummy argument in an interoperable interface is of type CHARACTER
   and is allocatable or a pointer, its character length shall be
   deferred."
{Note the existing rules in this subclause were SERIOUSLY broken; this
 repairs the character length hole.  There might be other holes remaining!}


6. Outstanding issues
---------------------

(1) I don't *think* we need to say this, but if we do we should say it with
    more specificity as to which interoperability requirements we are
    overriding.

    "Notwithstanding 15.3.2 paragraph 1, if a dummy argument of a procedure
     with the BIND attribute has type TYPE(*), the actual argument is
     considered to be interoperable.

     NOTE:
     This implies that derived types with components of any intrinsic
     type are also interoperable with TYPE(*) dummy arguments."

(2) If we must have a "type" member, it needs a value something like
        "CFI_type_non_interoperable    a non-interoperable data type"
    with some appropriate witter.

    But since this type member has other existing problems that are best
    handled by deleting it, this paper does not propose adding this entry
    to the table (or other such fixes) at this time.
