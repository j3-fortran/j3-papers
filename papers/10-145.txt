Discussion:
-----------

In f08 at [286:12.4.3.4.5p3] we allow (as a new feature) a dummy
argument with the ALLOCATABLE attribute to be distinguishable from a
dummy argument with the POINTER attribute.  Thus, I would conclude
that this generic interface is OK:

   interface  sub

      subroutine suba (a)
          real,allocatable :: a(:)
      end subroutine suba

     subroutine subp (a)
         real,pointer,intent(in) :: a(:)
     end subroutine subp

   end interface sub

This extension made perfect sense in the f03 context of pointer dummy
shall correspond to pointer actual.  However, at [296:12.5.2.7p2] we
have another new feature that allows a pointer dummy to correspond to
a non-pointer actual.  So, assuming the interface for sub above, how
is the following resolved:

    real,allocatable,target :: actual(:)
    allocate(actual(100))

    call sub (actual)

Either of the specific interfaces appears to be viable as a callee.


Question:
---------

Is there a fundamental contradiction in N1814, as exposed by the
example in the Discussion?


Answer:
-------

Yes.  The feature (12.4.3.4p3, below referred to as GEN) of allowing a
dummy argument with the ALLOCATABLE attribute to be distinguished from
a dummy argument with the POINTER attribute in a generic interface
conflicts with the feature (12.5.2.7p2, below referred to as PTR) of
allowing an actual argument with the ALLOCATABLE attribute to
correspond to a dummy with the POINTER attribute (and INTENT(IN)
attribute).


Resolution Alternatives:
------------------------

1) Modify feature GEN to restrict the dummy argument with the POINTER
attribute to not have the INTENT(IN) attribute for it to be
distinguishable from a dummy with the ALLOCATABLE attribute. This
would make the generic interface above disallowed.

2) Modify feature PTR by adding "nonallocatable" before "target" in
12.5.2.7p2. By disallowing an allocatable actual to correspond to the
pointer dummy, the second section of example code above is disallowed.

3) Remove feature GEN from the standard. This makes the generic
interface disallowed.

4) Remove feature PTR from the standard. This makes the call statement
in the example disallowed.

5) Introduce a new rule that establishes a priority favoring an exact
match in the case of more than one specific interface is allowed for a
reference to the generic.  In this case, the specific suba would be
selected because the actual and dummy arguments are both allocatable.

Resolution:
-----------

Alternative 1 preserves the most functionality of the two features
while also resolving the contradiction, and is hence favored. Edits for
this alternative are provided.


Edits:
------

In [286:12.4.3.4.5p3, line 4] after the current text:

"one has the ALLOCATABLE attribute and the other has the POINTER
attribute"

add

"and does not have the INTENT(IN) attribute"
