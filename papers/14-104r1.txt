Subject: Alternate suggestion for changes to counted events
Date: 2014 February 11
References: N1996, N1999


Discussion:
~~~~~~~~~~~

Nick MacLaren in his vote has pointed out that counted events still
suffer from incomplete specification in the TS draft, leading to
variant interpretations and possibly to a circular definition.

While there exists the fallback of permitting binary semaphores only,
the latter cause sufficiently much clutter in code that can profit
from counted events that I feel it is worth the trouble to retain
them. Therefore, this paper suggests adding suitable gatekeeper
semantics to EVENT WAIT, as well as removing the STAT_POSTED_IMAGE and
the MAX_COUNT feature. The way to retain counted events is based on
Bill Long's suggestion of allowing an UNTIL_COUNT on EVENT
WAIT.


Edits to N1996:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Section 6.2:

Replace [15:8-9], "An event variable ... event variable." by
"An event variable has a count that is updated by execution of a
sequence of EVENT POST or EVENT WAIT statements. The effect of each
change is as if it occurred instantaneously, without any overlap with
another change."


Section 6.3:

[15:24] Replace "post-spec-list" by "sync-stat-list"

[15:26-27] Delete R603

[15:29] Replace "event variable's count" with "count of the event
variable by 1".

[15:30-33] Delete "If the MAX_COUNT ... (6.5)."


Section 6.4:

[16:3] Replace "sync-stat-list" by "wait-spec-list" and insert
a new line
"R604+  wait-spec is UNTIL_COUNT = scalar_int_expr
                  or sync-stat

Replace [16:5-7] by

"Execution of an EVENT WAIT statement causes the following
 sequence of actions:

 (1) the threshold of its event argument is set to UNTIL_COUNT
     if this specifier is provided with a positive value,
     and to 1 otherwise,

 (2) the executing image waits until the count of the event variable
     is greater than or equal to its threshold value or an error
     condition occurs, and

 (3) if no error condition occurs, the event count is decreased
     by its threshold value."


Delete [16:8-10] "During execution ... another change"


[16:14-19] Delete section 6.5.


Section 7:

[23:40] After "successful waits", add " without an UNTIL_COUNT
specification".


Section 8:

[33:12-13] Delete.
{Removes the insertion of the now deleted 6.5 into Clause 13.}


Annex A:

[38:45-39:17] Replace example A.2.2 by John Reid's tree code:

"A tree is a graph in which every node except one has a single "parent"
node to which it is connected by an edge. The node without a parent is
the "root". The nodes that has a given node as parent are the "children"
of that node. The root is at level 1, its children are at level 2, etc.

A multifrontal code to solve a sparse set of linear equations involves
a tree. Work at a node starts after work at all its children is complete
and their data has been passed to it.

Here we assume that all the nodes have been assigned to images. Each
image has a list of its nodes and these are ordered in decreasing tree
level (all those at level L preceding those at level L-1). For each
node, array elements hold the number of children, details about the
parent and an event variable. This allows the processing to proceed
asynchrononously subject to the rule that a parent must wait for all
its children as follows:


PROGRAM TREE
  USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
  INTEGER,ALLOCATABLE :: NODE(:) ! Tree nodes that this image handles
  INTEGER,ALLOCATABLE :: NC(:)   ! NODE(I) has NC(I) children
  INTEGER,ALLOCATABLE :: PARENT(:), SUB(:)
                ! The parent of NODE(I) is NODE(SUB(I))[PARENT(I)]
  TYPE(EVENT_TYPE),ALLOCATABLE :: DONE(:)[*]
  INTEGER :: I, J, STATUS
! Set up the tree, including allocation of all arrays.
  DO I = 1, SIZE(NODE)
    ! Wait for children to complete
    EVENT_WAIT(DONE(I),UNTIL_COUNT=NC(I),STAT=STATUS)
    IF (STATUS/=0) EXIT

    ! Process node, using data from children
    IF (PARENT(I)>0) THEN
       ! Node is not the root.
       ! Place result on image PARENT(I) for node NODE(SUB)[PARENT(I)]
       ! Tell PARENT(I) that this has been done.
       EVENT_POST(DONE(SUB(I))[PARENT(I)],STAT=STATUS)
       IF (STATUS/=0) EXIT
    END IF
  END DO
END PROGRAM TREE"
