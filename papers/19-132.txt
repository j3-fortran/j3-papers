Introduction
------------
18-007r1 states in R708 "int-literal-constant is digit-string[_kind-param].
In addition, C7109 (R764) has, "A boz-literal-constant shall appear only
as a data-stmt-constant in a DATA statement, or where explicitly allowed
in 16.9 as an actual argument of an intrinsic procedure."  This
effectively makea an integer literal in Fortran a decimal constant which
is unlike several other programming languages employed in industry where
an integer literal can also be a hexadecimal or octal or binary constant.
Engineers, technologists, and scientists who often have to work with
various different programming languages in industry find this constraint
C7109 limiting in their pursuit of rapid and succint codes in Fortran
which need to interoperate with software components in
other languages whether they be database scripts or user-interfaces or
web services or data analysis environments.  Limitation of C7109 is felt
acutely when the same values of integer literal constants have to be
utilized in different interoperating software components but where the
source format of values is something other than decimal (e.g., hex) and
when there is an appreciable amount of data to be handled.

Formal Requirements
-------------------
Coders want to be able to represent integers as hexadecimal or octal or
binary values toward the following (but not limited to this) set of use
cases:

a) integer named constant and variable definition contexts
   integer[(kind=kind_param), parameter :: ] x = Z"FF"[_kind_param]
   integer[(kind=kind_param) :: ] n
   .
   n = O"034"
    
b) construct an array of integers to aid certain numeric processing tasks,
   often as named constants:
   integer[(kind=xx), parameter :: ] a(*) = [ integer[(kind=xx)] ::
      Z"d76aa478", Z"e8c7b756", .. &
      ! dozens of continuation lines
      .. ]

   Note: per current standard, a coder may arrive after several stumbles
   at code such as
   integer(I8), parameter :: foo(*) = [ int(Z"d76aa478",I8),     &
                                        int(Z"e8c7b756", I8), .. &
                                        ! dozens of continuation lines &
                                        .. ]

c) define enumerations in a manner consistent with that in the companion
   processor:
   enum, bind(C)
      enumerator :: PARAM_FOO = B"2000" ! in C, 0x2000
      enumerator :: PARAM_BAR = B"4000" ! in C, 0x4000
   end enum

d) utilize logical expressions that are more readable given a context:
   if ( buffer > Z"3F" ) then
      ! do something
   end if

e) SELECT CASE constructs which are more readable given a context:
   select case ( switch )
      case ( Z"FFFF" )
        ..
      case ( Z"FFFE" )
        ..
      ..
   end select

Formal Specification
--------------------
Under Numeric intrinsic types, Integer type, where any integer value can be
represented as a signed-int-literal-constant:

int-literal-constant is digit-string [ _ kind-param ]
                        boz-literal-constant [ _ kind-param ]
