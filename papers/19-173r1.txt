Sections of 19-173 other than 2.1 and 2.2 have been removed.  Section
2.4 to cover the case of specifying pointer lower bounds has been added.

2.2 Deferred shape object allocation
....................................

Allow to allocate a deferred-shape object using a rank-one object of
explicit shape and constant extent to specify bounds, e.g.

  allocate ( Y ( A ) ) ! lbound(Y) == [1,1,...], ubound(Y) == A,
                       ! SIZE(A,1) is a constant expression

or, more generally

  allocate ( Y ( B : A ) ) ! lbound(Y) == B, ubound(Y) == A, SIZE(A,1)
                           ! == SIZE(B,1) are constant expressions

e.g.,

  allocate ( Y ( lbound(A)-1 : ubound(A) + 1 )

insead of requiring

  allocate ( Y(lbound(a,1)-1:ubound(a,1)+1, &
           &   lbound(a,2)-1:ubound(a,2)+1, &
           &   lbound(a,3)-1:ubound(a,3)+1) )

The latter is not useful in a generic-programming context, wherein
RANK(Y) depends upon a generic parameter.

One bound could be a scalar, which is "broadcast" to the same shape as
the other bound, e.g.

  allocate ( Y ( 0 : shape(A)+1 ) )

instead of requiring

  allocate ( Y ( [ ( 0, i = 1, rank(A) ) ] : shape(A)+1 ) )

If the object (Y in the examples) is (allowed to be) a scalar, the
object used to declare the bounds (A in the examples) shall be an array,
and its extent shall be zero.

The Y@(A) notation is not necessary to distinguish from vector
subscripting because a vector subscript cannot be used to specify the
bounds of an object during allocation.

SIZE(A,1) might be zero, in which case Y shall be a scalar.

2.3 Pointer rank remapping
..........................

In a rank-remapping pointer assignment, the bounds of a pointer
object can be specified by rank-one arrays whose extents are constant
constant expressions that have the same value:

  P(A:B) => M(...)

or more generally:

  P( lbound(A)-1 : ubound(A)+1 ) => M(...)

instead of requiring

  P( lbound(A,1)-1 : ubound(A,1)+1, &
   & lbound(A,2)-1 : ubound(A,2)+1, &
   & lbound(A,3)-1 : ubound(A,3)+1 ) => M(...)

The latter is not useful in a generic-programming context, wherein
SIZE(A,1) depends upon a generic parameter.

In all cases, the rank of P is the extent of the bounds.

One set of bounds could be specified by a scalar, which is "broadcast"
to the same extent as the other bound, which specifies the rank, e.g.

  P ( 0 : shape(A)+1 ) => M(...)

instead of requiring

  P ( [ ( 0, i = 1, rank(A) ) ] : shape(A)+1 ) => M(...)

The P@(A) notation is not necessary to distinguish from vector
subscripting because a vector subscript cannot be used to specify the
bounds during rank-remapping pointer assignment.

SIZE(A,1) might be zero, in which case P shall be a scalar pointer.

2.4 Pointer lower bounds
------------------------

This subclause was not part of 19-173.

Allow to specify the lower bounds of a pointer during pointer assignment
using a single rank-one array with constant extent:

  P(A:) => M(...)

wherein the extent of A shall be the same as the rank of P, instead of
requiring

  P(A(1):,A(2):,A(3):) => M(...)

which is not useful in a generic-programming context, wherein
RANK(P) depends upon a generic parameter.

The P@(A) notation is not necessary to distinguish from vector
subscripting because a vector subscript cannot be used to specify the
lower bounds during pointer assignment.

SIZE(A,1) might be zero, in which case P shall be a scalar pointer.
