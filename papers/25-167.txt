Here are two suggested edits to 25-007r1.

1. This, I believe, is a simple mistake:

   [157:4] In 9.7.1.1 Form of the ALLOCATE statement, R933 allocation,
   after <<or>> add <allocate-object> so that the constraint reads
   R933 allocation is allocate-object [ ( allocate-shape-spec-list ) ]
                      []  [ lbracket allocate-coarray-spec rbracket ]
                   or allocate-object
				      [] ( [ lower-bounds-expr : ] upper-bounds-expr )
                      [] [ lbracket allocate-coarray-spec rbracket ]

2. Interp f23/012 corrected an editorial glitch in 9.7.3.2, Deallocation
   of allocatable variables, paragraph 10, final sentence, which now reads
       [163:23-24] "A coarray shall not become deallocated on an image
       unless the corresponding coarrays are successfully deallocated on
       all other active images in this team."
   The same editorial glitch occurs in 9.7.1.2, Execution of an ALLOCATE
   statement, para. 6., final sentence, and should be corrected in the
   same way. The problem is that it refers to a coarray as if it exists
   on all active images of the team. A coarray exists on one image and
   "corresponding coarrays" exist on other active images of the team, see
   5.4.7.

   [159:34-35] In 9.7.1.2, Execution of an ALLOCATE statement, para. 6.,
   final sentence, change "it is" to "the corresponding coarrays are" and
   add "other" before "active" so that the sentence reads
     "The coarray shall not become allocated on an image unless the
     corresponding coarrays are successfully allocated on all other active
     images in this team."
