One item of unfinished business from f03 is the issue
of making construct names be local to the construct.
This will allow, for example, a construct name to be repeated
within a scoping unit.

Title: Construct Name Local to Construct

Submitted By: J3

Status: For Consideration

References: 

Basic Functionality: Make a construct name be local to its construct.

Rationale:  Construct names are only referenced from within the construct.
            Therefore, it makes sense to use a construct scope
            for the name.  Further, within a local scope, a construct name
            might naturally be desirable more than once.  For example,
            within a local scope, an if-block might naturally be
            named "check_iostat" following more than one statement
            containing an iostat specifier, or more than one do-construct
            might be naturally named "all_rows", "all_columns",
            or "all_planes", etc.

            Of course, for cycle and exit to work properly, nexted constructs
            must all have names unique within the nest.

Estimated Impact: The impact was estimated by J3 at 167 as Trivial.

Detailed Specification: Define a construct name to have construct scope.
