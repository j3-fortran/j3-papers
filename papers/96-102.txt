   The CoCo Subgroup has the following comments on the fpp definition
   (X3J3/96-063) and the Fortran-like CoCo definition (X3J3/96-068):

    fpp
    ---

     o  It would be nice to require that the '#' be in position 1
        (*standard* cpp? and avoid problems with position 6.)

     o  It would be nice to only allow /* */ comments on # lines.

     o  It would be nice to ignore or recognize the Fortran INCLUDE line
        based on an option.

     o  Are there blanks allowed between the '#' and the following word
        (#define  vs.  # define)?

     o  If macros can expand past position 72 or 132 and automatically create
        a new line, is there also a check on the maximum number of
        continuation lines?

     o  Are keywords reserved, like "if", "ifdef", "defined" or "define"?

     o  Are keywords required to be in lower-case (#ifdef vs. #IFDEF)?

     o  Are names case-sensitive?

     o  Can a #include file #include itself?


    Fortran-like CoCo
    -----------------

     o  The paper does not currently state that continued CoCo directives
        are required to be contiguous.  For example, the following is
        erroneous and this needs to be stated in the CoCo definition

           ??  if (log_expr) &
           program InTheWrongPlace
           ??  then

     o  The ?? starting characters of a CoCo directive need not be mentioned
        in the BNF as CoCo directives may be split.  The BNF terms will
        be modified.
