Introduction

This technical report defines a proposed extension to the data-typing
facilities of the programming language Fortran. The current Fortran language is
defined by the international standard ISO/IEC 1539-1 : 1996. This technical
report has been prepared by ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG5, the technical working group
for the Fortran language. The language extension defined by this technical
report is intended to be incorporated in the next revision of the Fortran
language without change except where experience in implementation and usage
indicates that changes are essential. Such changes will only be made where
serious errors in the definition or difficulties in integration with other new
facilities are encountered.

This extension is being defined by means of a technical report in the first
instance to allow early publication of the proposed definition. This is to
encourage early implementation of important extended functionalities in a
consistent manner and will allow extensive testing of the design of the
extended functionality prior to its incorporation into the language by way of
the revision of the international standard.

Technical Report:  Data-type enhancements
 General
 Scope

This technical report defines a proposed extension to the data-typing
facilities of the programming language Fortran. The current Fortran language is
defined by the international standard ISO/IEC 1539-1 : 1996. The proposed
extension allows components of derived types to be allocatable arrays.

Section 2 of this technical report contains a general informal but precise
description of the proposed extended functionalities. This is followed by
detailed editorial changes which if applied to the current international
standard would implement the revised language definitions.

 Normative References

The following standards contain provisions which, through reference in this
text, constitute provisions of this technical report.  At the time of
publication, the editions indicated were valid.  All standards are subject to
revision, and parties to agreements based on this technical report are
encouraged to investigate the possibility of applying the most recent editions
of the standards indicated below.  Members of IEC and ISO maintain registers of
currently valid International Standards.

 Rationale

There are many situations when programming in Fortran where it is necessary to
allocate and deallocate arrays of variable size but the full power of pointer
arrays is unnecessary and undesirable.  In such situations the abilities of a
pointer array to alias other arrays and to have non-unit (and variable at
execution time) strides are unnecessary, and they are undesirable because this
limits optimization, increases the complexity of the program, and increases the
likelihood of memory leakage.  The ALLOCATABLE attribute solves this problem
but can currently only be used for locally stored arrays, a very significant
limitation.  The most pressing need is for this to be extended to array
components; without allocatable array components it is overwhelmingly difficult
to create opaque data types with a size that varies at runtime without serious
performance penalties and memory leaks.

A major reason for extending the ALLOCATABLE attribute to include dummy
arguments and function results is to avoid introducing further irregularities
into the language.  Furthermore, allocatable dummy arguments improve the
ability to hide inessential details during problem decomposition by allowing
the allocation and deallocation to occur in called subprograms, which is often
the most natural position.  Allocatable function results ease the task of
creating array functions whose shape is not determined initially on function
entry, without negatively impacting performance.

 Requirements

The following subsections contain a general description of the extensions
required to the syntax and semantics of the current Fortran language to provide
facilities for regularization of the ALLOCATABLE attribute.

 Allocatable Attribute Regularization

In order to avoid irregularities in the language, the ALLOCATABLE attribute
needs to be allowed for all data entities for which it makes sense.  Thus, this
attribute which was previously limited to locally stored array variables is now
allowed on array components of structures, dummy arrays, and array function
results.

Allocatable entities remain forbidden from occurring in all places where they
may be storage-associated (COMMON blocks and EQUIVALENCE statements).
Allocatable array components may appear in SEQUENCE types, but objects of such
types are then prohibited from COMMON and EQUIVALENCE.

The semantics for the allocation status of an allocatable entity remain
unchanged:
 If it is in a main program or has the SAVE attribute, it has an initial
 allocation status of not currently allocated.  Its allocation status changes
 only as a result of ALLOCATE and DEALLOCATE statements.
 If it is a module variable without the SAVE attribute, the initial allocation
 status is not currently allocated and the allocation status may become not
 currently allocated (by automatic deallocation) whenever execution of a RETURN
 or END statement results in no active procedure having access to the module.
 If it is a local variable (not accessed by use association) and does not have
 the SAVE attribute, the allocation status becomes not currently allocated on
 entry to the outermost procedure which has access to it.  On exit from this
 procedure it is automatically deallocated and the allocation status changes to
 not currently allocated.

Since an allocatable entity cannot be an alias for an array section (unlike
pointers arrays), it may always be stored contiguously.

 Allocatable Arrays as Dummy Arguments

An allocatable dummy argument array shall have associated with it an actual
argument which is also an allocatable array.

On procedure entry the allocation status of an allocatable dummy array becomes
that of the associated actual argument.  If the dummy argument is not
INTENT(OUT) and the actual argument is currently allocated, the value of the
dummy argument is that of the associated actual argument.

While the procedure is active, an allocatable dummy argument array that does
not have INTENT(IN) may be allocated, deallocated, defined, or become
undefined.  Once any of these events have occurred no reference to the
associated actual argument via another alias is permitted .

On exit from the routine the actual argument has the allocation status of the
allocatable dummy argument (there is no change, of course, if the allocatable
dummy argument has INTENT(IN)).  The usual rules apply for propagation of the
value from the dummy argument to the actual argument.

No automatic deallocation of the allocatable dummy argument occurs as a result
of execution of a RETURN or END statement in the procedure of which it is a
dummy argument.

Note that an INTENT(IN) allocatable dummy argument array cannot have its
allocation status altered within the called procedure.  Thus the main
difference between such a dummy argument and a normal dummy array is that it
might be unallocated on entry (and throughout execution of the procedure).

Example:

SUBROUTINE LOAD(ARRAY, FILE)
	REAL, ALLOCATABLE, INTENT(OUT) :: ARRAY(:, :, :)
	CHARACTER(LEN=*), INTENT(IN) :: FILE
	INTEGER UNIT, N1, N2, N3
	INTEGER, EXTERNAL :: GET_LUN
	UNIT = GET_LUN()
	OPEN(UNIT, FILE=FILE, FORM='UNFORMATTED')
	READ(UNIT) N1, N2, N3
	ALLOCATE(ARRAY(N1, N2, N3))
	READ(UNIT) ARRAY
	CLOSE(UNIT)
END SUBROUTINE LOAD

Implementation Cost

Minimal, similar to pointer dummy arrays (except that the descriptor need not
be so big).

 Allocatable Array Function Results

An allocatable array function shall have an explicit interface.

On entry to an allocatable array function, the allocation status of the result
variable becomes not currently allocated.

The function result variable may be allocated and deallocated any number of
times during the execution of the function; however, it shall be currently
allocated and have a defined value on exit from the function.  Automatic
deallocation of the result variable does not occur immediately on exit from the
function, but after execution of the statement in which the function reference
occurs.1

Example

FUNCTION INQUIRE_FILES_OPEN()
  LOGICAL,ALLOCATABLE :: INQUIRE_FILES_OPEN(:)
  INTEGER I,J
  LOGICAL TEST
  DO I=1000,0,-1
    INQUIRE(UNIT=I,OPENED=TEST,ERR=100)
    IF (TEST) EXIT
100 CONTINUE
  END DO
  ALLOCATE(INQUIRE_FILES_OPEN(0:I))
  DO J=0,I
    INQUIRE(UNIT=J,OPENED=INQUIRE_FILES_OPEN(J))
  END DO
  END

Implementation Cost

Minimal, mostly just to establish an appropriate calling convention.
Deallocation of the result can be handled exactly as explicit-shape-spec array
functions currently.

 Allocatable Array Components

Allocatable array components are defined to be ultimate components just as
pointer components are, because the value (if any) is stored separately from
the rest of the structure and this storage does not exist (because the array is
unallocated) when the structure is created.  As with ultimate pointer
components, variables containing ultimate allocatable array components are
forbidden from appearing directly in input/output lists - the user shall list
any allocatable array or pointer component for i/o.

As per allocatable arrays currently, they are forbidden from storage
association contexts (so any variable containing an ultimate allocatable array
component cannot appear in COMMON or EQUIVALENCE); this maintains the clarity
and optimizability of allocatable arrays.  However, allocatable array
components are permitted in SEQUENCE types, which can be used as global type
definitions without recourse to modules.

In a structure constructor for a derived type containing an allocatable array
component, the expression corresponding to the allocatable array component must
be one of the following:
- an argumentless reference to the intrinsic function NULL(); this signifies
that the allocatable array component is to have an allocation status of not
currently allocated.
- a variable that is itself an allocatable array; the allocatable array
component receives the allocation status of the variable, and, if allocated,
the shape and value of the variable.
- any other array expression; the allocatable array component has an allocation
status of currently allocated with the same shape and value as the expression.

For intrinsic assignment of objects of a derived type containing an allocatable
array component, the allocatable array component of the variable on the
left-hand-side receives the allocation status and, if allocated, the shape and
value of the corresponding component of the expression.  This occurs as if the
following sequence of steps is carried out:
(1) If the component of the variable is currently allocated, it is deallocated.
(2) If the corresponding component of the expression is currently allocated,
the component of the variable is allocated with the same shape.  The value of
the component of the expression is then assigned to the corresponding component
of the variable using intrinsic assignment.

Implementation Cost

Minimal.  It will be necessary to store a descriptor in the derived type, but
this need not be as powerful as a pointer array descriptor.


Example

MODULE REAL_POLYNOMIAL_MODULE
  TYPE REAL_POLYNOMIAL
    REAL, ALLOCATABLE :: COEFF(:)
  END TYPE
  INTERFACE OPERATOR(+)
    MODULE PROCEDURE RP_ADD_RP, RP_ADD_R
  END INTERFACE
CONTAINS
  FUNCTION RP_ADD_R(P1,R)
    TYPE(REAL_POLYNOMIAL) RP_ADD_R, P1
    REAL R
    INTENT(IN) P1,R
    P1%COEFF(1) = P1%COEFF(1) + R
  END FUNCTION
  FUNCTION RP_ADD_RP(P1)
    TYPE(REAL_POLYNOMIAL) RP_ADD_RP, P1, P2
    INTENT(IN) P1, P2
    INTEGER M
    ALLOCATE(RP_ADD_RP(MAX(SIZE(P1%COEFF), SIZE(P2%COEFF))))
    M = MIN(SIZE(P1%COEFF, P2%COEFF))
    RP_ADD_RP(:M) = P1%COEFF(:M) + P2%COEFF(:M)
    IF (SIZE(P1%COEFF)>M) THEN
      RP_ADD_RP(M+1:) = P1%COEFF(M+1:)
    ELSE IF (SIZE(P2%COEFF)>M) THEN
      RP_ADD_RP(M+1:) = P2%COEFF(M+1:)
    END IF
  END FUNCTION
END MODULE

PROGRAM EXAMPLE
  USE REAL_POLYNOMIAL_MODULE
  TYPE(REAL_POLYNOMIAL) P, Q, R
  P = REAL_POLYNOMIAL((/1,2,1/))		! Set P to (X**2+2X+4)
  Q = REAL_POLYNOMIAL((/1,-1/))			! Set Q to (X-1)
  R = P + Q					! Polynomial addition
  PRINT *, 'Coefficients are: ', R%COEFF
END

 Required editorial changes to ISO/IEC 1539-1 : 1996

The following subsections contain the editorial changes to ISO/IEC 1539-1 :
1996 required to include these extensions in a revised definition of the
international standard for the Fortran language.
Note, where new syntax rules are inserted they are numbered with a decimal
addition to the rule number that precedes them. In the actual document these
will have to be properly numbered in the revised sequence.

Comments about each edit to the standard appear within braces {}.

{Page and line number references in these edits are to the March 1996 version
of X3J3/96-007.}

4.4, first paragraph, list item (2)				[37:42]
	Change	"nonpointer component that is of derived type,"
	To:		"component that is of derived type and is not a pointer
or allocatable array,"
{The direct component tree stops at allocatable arrays, just as with pointers.}

4.4, second paragraph						[38:1]
	Insert		", are allocatable arrays" after "of intrinsic type".
{This makes allocatable array components into ultimate components, just as
pointer components.}

4.4.1, R426 component-attr-spec					[38:42+]
	add new production to rule: "or ALLOCATABLE".
{Allow ALLOCATABLE attribute in component-def-stmt.}

R427, sixth constraint						[39:13]
	change "the POINTER attribute is not"
	to "neither the POINTER attribute nor the ALLOCATABLE attribute is"
{Do not require an explicit-shape-spec-list when ALLOCATABLE is specified.}

Two new constraints at end of list				[39:16+]
	Add:
"Constraint: If the ALLOCATABLE attribute is specified for a component, the
component shall be a deferred-shape array.
Constraint: POINTER and ALLOCATABLE shall not both appear in the same
component-def-stmt.
{Require ALLOCATABLE components to be deferred-shape arrays.  Ensure POINTER
and ALLOCATABLE are exclusive.}

R428 component-initialization					[39:29+]
	Add new constraint to end of list:
		"Constraint: If the ALLOCATABLE attribute appears in the
component-attr-spec-list, component-initialization shall not appear."
{Forbid default initialization - allocatable array components are already
effectively default-initialized to "not currently allocated".}

4.4.1, paragraph beginning "If the SEQUENCE statement is"	[39:38-39]
	add "or allocatable arrays"
	after both occurrences of "are not pointers".
{Allocatable array components, like pointer components, stop a SEQUENCE type
from being a standard (numeric or character) sequence type.}

4.4.1, after Note 4.25,						[42:20+]
	add new example:
"Note 4.25.1
	A derived type may have a component that is an allocatable array.  For
example:
		TYPE STACK
			INTEGER :: INDEX
			INTEGER, ALLOCATABLE :: CONTENTS(:)
		END TYPE STACK
	For each variable of type STACK, the shape of component CONTENTS is
determined by execution of an ALLOCATE statement or evaluation of a structure
constructor (of type STACK) that is associated with a dummy argument."
{Example needed.}

4.4.4, add new paragraphs to end of section:			[45:19+]
	"If a component of a derived type is an allocatable array, the
corresponding constructor expression shall either be a reference to the
intrinsic function NULL() with no arguments, an allocatable array, or shall
evaluate to an array.  If the expression is a reference to the intrinsic
function NULL(), the corresponding component of the constructor has a status of
not currently allocated.  If the expression is an allocatable array, the
corresponding component of the constructor has the same allocation status as
that allocatable array and, if it is allocated, the same shape and value.  With
any other expression that evaluates to an array the corresponding component of
the constructor has an allocation status of currently allocated with the same
shape and value as the expression.

Note 4.34.1:
The allocation status of the allocatable array component is available to the
user program only if the constructor is associated with a dummy argument. Also,
when the constructor value is used in an assignment, the corresponding
component of the variable being defined shall already be allocated with the
same shape as the component in the constructor.

If a derived type contains an ultimate allocatable array component, its
constructor shall not appear as a data-stmt-constant in a DATA statement
(5.2.9), as an initialization-expr in an entity-decl (5.1), or as an
initialization-expr in a component-initialization (4.4.1)."
{Allow structure constructors for derived types with allocatable array
components, and define their semantics.}

5.1, eighth constraint, begins "The PARAMETER attribute shall not":	[48:12]
	After "allocatable arrays,"
	Add "derived-type objects with an ultimate component that is an
allocatable array or pointer,"
{forbid such objects from having the PARAMETER attribute - unnecessary since it
is impossible to construct a value for them as an initialization expression.
But that is pretty obscure so it is better to spell it out explicitly.}

5.1, third-last constraint, begins "initialization shall not appear":	[48:33]
	after "an allocatable array,"
	add "a derived-type object containing an ultimate allocatable array
component,"
{forbid such types from having =initialization.  This is also unnecessary, but
clearer than leaving it to an obscure consequence.}

5.1.2.4.3, second paragraph					[55:12]
	After "An allocatable array is", change "a named array" to "an array".
{Do not insist on allocatable arrays being simple names, i.e. allow
components.}

5.1.2.4.3, third paragraph, begins "The ALLOCATABLE attribute may be":
								[55:15-19]
	Replace paragraph with:
	"The ALLOCATABLE attribute may be specified for an array in a type
declaration statement, a component definition statement, or an ALLOCATABLE
statement (5.2.6).  An array with the ALLOCATABLE attribute shall be declared
with a deferred-shape-spec-list in a type declaration statement, an ALLOCATABLE
statement, a component definition statement, a DIMENSION statement (5.2.5), or
a TARGET statement (5.2.8).  The type and type parameters may be specified in a
type declaration statement or a component definition statement."

5.2.10, R533-R537 second constraint				[61:40]
	Change "or an allocatable array"
	To "an allocatable array, or a variable of a derived type that has an
allocatable array as an ultimate component"
{Forbid initialization of allocatable arrays via the DATA statement.}

5.4, R545 first constraint					[66:2-3]
	After: ", a pointer,"
	Insert "an allocatable array, or"
	After "is a pointer"
	Delete ",".
{Do not allow derived types containing allocatable arrays in NAMELIST.}

5.5.1, R548 first constraint					[66:40]
	After "an allocatable array,"
	Insert "an object of a derived type containing an allocatable array as
an ultimate component,"
{Do not allow derived types containing allocatable arrays in EQUIVALENCE.}

5.5.2, R550 second constraint					[69:1]
	After "allocatable array,"
	Insert "an object of a derived type containing an allocatable array as
an ultimate component,"
{Do not allow derived types containing allocatable arrays in COMMON.}

6.1.2, R612-R613, fourth constraint				[75:14]
	After "shall not have the POINTER attribute"
	Insert "or the ALLOCATABLE attribute"
{We do not want to have arrays of allocatable array elements, one from each
allocatable array component.}

6.3.1.1, new paragraph at end of section			[80:29+]
	"If an object of derived type is created by an ALLOCATE statement, any
ultimate allocatable components have an allocation status of not currently
allocated."
{Specify allocation status of allocatable array components created by an
ALLOCATE statement.}

6.3.1.2, new paragraph following the second paragraph		[80:42+]
	"An allocatable array that is a dummy argument of a procedure receives
the allocation status of the actual argument with which it is associated on
entry to the procedure.  An allocatable array that is an ultimate component of
a dummy argument of a procedure receives the allocation status of the
corresponding component of the actual argument on entry to the procedure.
{Specify initial status of allocatable dummy arrays.  The second sentence is
probably not strictly necessary, but serves to clarify.}

6.3.1.2, third paragraph					[80:43]
	After "that is a local variable of a procedure"
	Insert "or an ultimate component thereof, that is not a dummy argument
(or a subobject thereof)"
{Exclude allocatable dummy arrays from the initial "not currently allocated"
status, and also from automatic deallocation.}

6.3.1.2, third paragraph					[81:1]
	After "If the array"
	Add "is not the result variable of the procedure (or a subobject
thereof) and"
{Exclude allocatable function results from automatic deallocation.}

6.3.3.1, second paragraph					[83:10-13]
	After "has the SAVE attribute,"
	Add new list items and renumber rest of list:
		(2) It is a dummy argument or an ultimate component thereof.
		(3) It is a function result variable or an ultimate component
thereof.
{Say that these cases retain their allocation status (and thus are excluded
from automatic deallocation).}

6.3.3.1, before Note 6.18,					[83:18+]
	Add new paragraph:
"If a statement contains a reference to a function whose result is an
allocatable array or a structure that contains an ultimate allocatable array
component, and the function reference is executed, an allocatable array result
and any allocated ultimate allocatable array components in the result returned
by the function are deallocated after execution of this statement."
{Specify when a function result is deallocated.  Perhaps this is not
necessary.}

7.1.4.1, fifth paragraph					[91:27]
	After "returns a disassociated pointer"
	Insert "or designates an unallocated allocatable array component of a
structure constructor"
	After "A disassociated pointer"
	Insert "or unallocated allocatable array"
	After "with the result"					[91:30]
	Insert "or by the corresponding component in a structure constructor"

7.1.6.1.							[94:6]
	After "(3) A structure constructor where each component is an
initialization expression"
	Insert "and no component has the ALLOCATABLE attribute"
{Exclude structure constructors containing allocatable components from
initialization expressions.}

7.5.1.5, paragraph after Note 7.43				[109:35-38]
	After "nonpointer components" change "." to
"that are not allocatable arrays.  For allocatable array components the
following sequence of operations is applied:
(1) If the component of variable is currently allocated, it is deallocated.
(2) If the component of expr is currently allocated, the corresponding
component of variable is allocated with the same shape.  The value of the
component of expr is then assigned to the corresponding component of variable
using intrinsic assignment."
{Specify semantics to be used for assignment of derived types containing
allocatable array components.  Note that because pointers to deallocated
objects become undefined, this definition does not rule out optimising away the
allocation-deallocation when the components are already allocatec with the same
shape.}

7.5.1.5, After Note 7.44					[110:5+]
	Add new note:
"Note 7.44.1: 
If an allocatable array component of expr is not currently allocated, the
corresponding component of variable has an allocation status of not currently
allocated after execution of the assignment."
{Note that assignments containing unallocated components are allowed and have
the expected effect.}

9.4.2, paragraph after Note 9.26				[149:6]
	After "If a derived type ultimately contains a pointer component"
	Insert "or an allocatable array component"
{Exclude objects of derived type containing ultimate array components from
appearing in i/o statements.}

12.2.1.1							[192:14]
	After "whether it is optional (5.1.2.6,5.2.2),"

12.3.1.1 item (2)						[193:18]
	After "assumed-shape array,"
	Insert "an allocatable array,"
{Require explicit interface if there is an allocatable dummy array.}

12.4.1.1							[201:21+]
	After the paragraph beginning "If a dummy argument is an assumed-shape
array"
	Add a new paragraph:
"If a dummy argument is an allocatable array the actual argument shall be an
allocatable array and the types, type parameters and ranks shall agree.  It is
permissible for the actual argument to have an allocation status of not
currently allocated."
{Requirements for arguments associated with an allocatable dummy array.}

12.4.1.6, item (1) of first paragraph				[203:28-29]
	Replace "No action that affects the allocation status may be taken."
	With "Action that affects the allocation status of the entity or any
part thereof shall be taken through the dummy argument."
{Allow ALLOCATE/DEALLOCATE via the dummy whilst prohibiting it via any other
alias.}

12.4.1.6, item (2) of first paragraph				[205:5]
	After "If the pointer association status"
	Insert "or the allocation status"
{After ALLOCATE/DEALLOCATE of the dummy, prohibit all other accesses to the
actual argument.}

13.14.79,
	After "a disassociated pointer"				[259:26]
	Insert "or unallocated allocatable array"
	After "disassociated association status"		[259:33]
	Insert "or, when corresponding to an allocatable array component in a
structure constructor, an unallocated allocatable array"

Annex A, entry "allocatable array"				[293:12-13]
	Change "A named array"
	To "An array"
	Add new sentence to end of entry "An allocatable array may be a named
array or a structure component."

Annex A, entry "direct component"				[295:38]
	Change "nonpointer component that is of derived type"
	To "component that is of derived type and is not a pointer or
allocatable array,"

Annex A, entry "ultimate component"				[301:11-13]
	After "is of intrinsic type"
	Insert ", has the ALLOCATABLE attribute,"
	After "does not have the POINTER attribute"
	Insert "or the ALLOCATABLE attribute"

Footnotes:
(1) This storage can thus be reclaimed at the same time as that of array
temporaries and the results of explicit-shape-spec functions referenced in the
expression.

(2) This ensures that any pointers that point to the previous contents of the
allocatable array component of the variable become undefined.  Implementations
are thus free to skip the allocation-deallocation (or not) when the component
of the variable happens to be allocated with the same shape as the
corresponding component of the expression, whichever is most efficient.
