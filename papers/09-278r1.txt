The original premise of 09-278:

    Subclause 1.5 specifies the conditions necessary for a processor to
    conform.  It doesn't include a requirement to detect and report error
    conditions that occur during program execution.

    If an error condition occurs during execution of a program it is by
    definition not standard conforming.

is false.  On page 23, 1.5p1 says

    A program (2.2.2) is a standard-conforming program if it uses only
    those forms and relationships described herein and if the program has
    an interpretation according to this part of ISO/IEC 1539.

A program that uses STAT= to catch an error is using standard forms and
has a standard interpretation so it is a standard-conforming program.

1.5p2(1) says

    A processor conforms to this part of ISO/IEC 1539 if:

     (1) it executes any standard-conforming program in a manner that
         fulfills the interpretations herein, subject to any limits that
         the processor may impose on the size and complexity of the program;

This says a standard-conforming processor is supposed to execute as specified
by the standard, including handling run-time errors as specified by the standard.

Therefore we reject section 1 and the edits in section 2 of 09-278.

Section 3 asks about the values returned in STATUS by GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE.
The text does not make it clear that STATUS == 0 is not an error but all other
values STATUS may be set to are errors.  It also does not make clear that any
error that would set STATUS to a non-zero value when STATUS is not present
causes error termination of the program to be initiated.  This is also true for
GET_COMMAND, GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT, and partially for EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE.

But GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE, GET_COMMAND, and GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT are in F2003
so changing their behavior to specify that error termination is initiated if a
non-zero status result occurs but the status variable is not present would be a
potentially large change to the standard and to existing implementations.

Therefore we propose an edit for EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE since it is new in F2008
but no change to GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE, GET_COMMAND, and GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT
at this time.  Those three may be repaired via the F2008 interp process in the
future.

EDITS:

[348:6] change

    "If an error condition occurs and CMDSTAT is not present, error termination
     of execution of the image is initiated."
to
    "If a condition occurs that would assign a non-zero value to CMDSTAT but
     the CMDSTAT variable is not present, error termination is initiated."

---- rejected text --------------------------------------------------------------

1. Introduction

Subclause 1.5 specifies the conditions necessary for a processor to
conform.  It doesn't include a requirement to detect and report error
conditions that occur during program execution.

Subclause 6.7.1 enumerates several error conditions, but 6.7.1.2p9 says
the set of error conditions for an ALLOCATE statement is processor
dependent.  Presumably this means any error conditions in addition to
those specified.  6.7.1.2p9 then requires a processor to initiate error
termination if an error condition occurs during execution of an ALLOCATE
statement that does not contain a STAT= specifier.  How can it be
required to initiate error termination if it isn't required to detect
the errors?

This isn't covered by 1.5p2(1) because that item is conditional on the
program being a standard-conforming program.  If an error condition
occurs during execution of a program it is by definition not standard
conforming.

Similar requirements appear in 6.7.3 concerning the DEALLOCATE
statement, and throughout clauses 9 and 10.

3.  Questions without answers or edits

[352:32-37 13.7.67p3 STATUS]--------------------------------------------
Two values are defined for the optional STATUS argument of the
GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE subroutine.  They aren't defined to be error
conditions.  But then the specification allows other values for other
error processor-dependent conditions.

  o Are the conditions specified error conditions?

  o If they occur, is error termination initiated?
