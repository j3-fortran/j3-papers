NUMBER:  F03/0033
TITLE:  IEEE_VALUE()
KEYWORDS: IEEE-754, IEEE_VALUE
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation 
STATUS: For consideration

QUESTION:

What does "Generate an IEEE value" in 14.9.2 mean?

Fortran 2003 in 14.9.2 has: "Generate an IEEE value" without any
explanation of what that means, nor any indication that it is
defined elsewhere.

ANSWER:

14.9 contains tables of procedures with a short description of each, 
modelled on 13.5. Each procedure is specified in 14.10 and the 
reader should have no difficulty in finding its specification there. 

EDITS: None.
