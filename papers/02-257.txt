42:6-7. Delete 'or of an accessible … type'.
[An alias name is an alias to a <declaration-type-spec>, not a type name, so it
is inappropriate here. This replaces my suggestion in 02-242.]

164:18. Delete 'or type alias name'.
[An alias name is an alias to a <declaration-type-spec>, not a type name, so it
is inappropriate here.]

165:22-23. Change first comma to 'and' and delete ', and has …selector'.
165:25-26. Delete sentence 'The type parameters …'.
165:28-29. Delete sentence 'The type parameters …'.
165:29+ Add paragraph:
   The type parameters of the associating entity are those of the selector.
[A polymorphic entity may have extra type parameters for its dynamic type that
are not normally accessible. The present text says that the associating entity
has no such parameters. I believe that this is not intended. Why should it not
have the extra parameters and a nested SELECT TYPE construct access them?]
