Subj:  F95 interp letter ballot #7 results

[The first draft of this paper is WG5/N1554 on the table at the Dresden.]

Here are the results of the J3 letter ballot #7 on F95 interps.

5 Fortran 95 interpretations are currently "passed by J3 meeting" in
02-006Ar1.txt.  This was the letter ballot phase to go from "passed
by J3 meeting" to "passed by J3 letter ballot".

13 of 14 J3 members voted {no ballot received from Ingrassia;  Hirchert's
ballot was briefly lost but counted}.

The following Fortran 95 interpretations were balloted:

Result   Yes   No    Number       Title

Passed   13    0     000099       STAT= variable requirements in ALLOCATE
Passed   13    0     000100       TARGET attribute and structure components
Pending  10    3     000101       Generic resolution
Passed   13    0     JP-17        Multiple occurrence of namelist group
                                  object in namelist group
Passed   13    0     JP-24        The bnf term shared-term-do-construct

4 interps pass the letter ballot {99, 100, JP-17, JP-24} - these can be
accepted by WG5 and become "Passed by WG5 ballot".

1 interp is still pending, based on 3 no votes - /interp would appreciate
any input WG5 would like to give on this interp:

*	Rob James' NO vote on interpretation 000101:

	The proposed edit for this interpretation clearly makes the code in
	question non-conforming, but I believe it goes too far.  The edit also
	makes the following code non-conforming, although the intent of the code is
	obvious:

		      INTERFACE g
		        SUBROUTINE s1(p)
		          INTERFACE
		            SUBROUTINE p
		            END SUBROUTINE
		          END INTERFACE
		        END SUBROUTINE
		        SUBROUTINE s2(p)
		          INTERFACE
		            REAL FUNCTION p()
		            END FUNCTION
		          END INTERFACE
		        END SUBROUTINE
		      END INTERFACE
		      INTERFACE
		        SUBROUTINE procedure
		        END SUBROUTINE
		      END INTERFACE
		      CALL g(procedure)
		      END

	I believe that this code should be standard-conforming.  Perhaps an edit to
	clarify what it means for a reference to be "consistent with" a specific
	interface (in section 14.1.2.4.1) would be more appropriate, rather than a
	blanket restriction on generic interfaces like the one appearing in the
	code in question.

*	Craig Dedo's No vote on Interpretation 101:

	I agree with Rob James.  Let's see if there is a fairly painless way
	to implement his idea.  If, after due consideration, it appears that his
	idea will be unduly complicated, I will change my vote to "Yes".

*	Kurt Hirchert's NO vote on Interpretation 101:

	I tend to agree with Rob James comments on this item.  The key question
	for me is whether it was ever intended to be allowed to use a procedure
	with an implicit interface as an actual argument associated with a dummy
	procedure declared with an explicit interface.  If this is not allowed,
	then the program in the original question is not conforming because the
	argument PROCEDURE cannot validly be associated with the P dummy argument
	of either S1 or S2, and Rob's example _might_ be conforming (depending on
	whether we believe a subroutine has a "different type" from a
	function).  If it is allowed, then the original question illustrates why
	we can never make Rob's example valid (not in F95, not in F2K, not in a
	future revision).  Even if we believe we don't have sufficient words to
	consider Rob's example standard conforming in F95, I believe it is
	desirable that we be able to make it so in the future.

	I am confident that it was our original intent in F90 that such
	associations not be allowed; I am less confident that the words still say
	that.  (I can read the words that way, but I am uncertain that the words
	that are there now were intended to be read the way I am reading them.  If
	not, was this an intentional technical change from our original position
	in F90 or an editorial accident?)

The text of these interpretetions is attached.  Each interpretation
starts with a row of "-"s.

Thanks                         /Stan

NUMBER: 000099
TITLE: STAT= variable requirements in ALLOCATE
KEYWORDS: ALLOCATE, STAT=
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

[79:40-41] says
  "The <stat-variable> shall not appear in a bound in the same
   ALLOCATE statement."

This requirement appears, on the face of it, to apply to the syntax,
not to whichever actual variable is identified by the syntax.

Question 1:

Given
  INTEGER :: A(10) = (/ (i,i=1,10) /)
  POINTER P(:)
  READ *,I,J
  ALLOCATE(P(A(I)),STAT=A(J))

Is the ALLOCATE standard-conforming, or does it depend on the relative
values of I and J?

From the quoted text, it would appear that it is always conforming,
even when I==J.

Question 2:

Similarly, given:
  EQUIVALENCE(I,J)
  POINTER P(:)
  I = 5
  ALLOCATE(P(I),STAT=J)

is the ALLOCATE conforming?

Question 3:

Similarly, given:
  POINTER P(:)
  INTRINSIC DIGITS
  I = 5
  ALLOCATE(P(DIGITS(I)),STAT=I)

is the ALLOCATE conforming?

From the quoted text, it would appear not to be conforming, despite
the non-dependence of the array bound on the value of the STAT=
variable.

ANSWER:

The intent was that the restriction should apply to the actual
variable being used for the STAT= variable, not to the syntax.  Thus,

(1) The ALLOCATE statement is only standard-conforming if I and J are
    not equal.

(2) The ALLOCATE statement is not standard-conforming.

(3) The ALLOCATE statement is standard-conforming.

Edits to the standard are supplied to clarify this.

EDITS:

[79:40-41] Delete "The ... statement."
[80:6] Append to paragraph
  "No array bound in an ALLOCATE statement shall depend on the value
   of the <stat-variable>."

NUMBER: 000100
TITLE: TARGET attribute and structure components
KEYWORDS: TARGET, POINTER
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

The standard says ([110:43-44]), of R737 <pointer-assignment-stmt>,
  "Constraint: The <variable> shall have the TARGET attribute or be a
               subobject of an object with the TARGET attribute, or
               it shall have the POINTER attribute."

It also says ([75:22-23]), of structure components
  "A structure component has the ... TARGET ... attribute if the
   parent object has the attribute."

The <<parent object>> is defined ([75:16]) as
   "the data object whose name is the leftmost part name".

Consider:
  TYPE t
    REAL x
  END TYPE
  TYPE(t),POINTER :: p
  REAL,POINTER :: q
  ALLOCATE(p)
  q => p%x

Q1. Is this standard-conforming?

If the answer to Q1 is Yes, this still appears to leave unspecified
the case of A%B%C where A does not have the TARGET attribute and B
has the POINTER attribute.  The parent object of A%B%C is just A, and
A does not have the TARGET attribute.

Therefore the conclusion is that A%B%C does not have the TARGET
attribute.

Note: Although the standard says that "Allocation of a pointer
creates an object that implicitly has the TARGET attribute"
[81:47-48], is it not entirely sure that this shows that A%B%C has
the attribute for two reasons:

(1) Allocation is not the only way of establishing pointer
    associations.
(2) According to the quoted text, whether A%B refers to an object
    with the TARGET attribute is immaterial; the only question is
    whether A itself has the TARGET attribute.

Q2. Does this A%B%C have the TARGET attribute?

Note: the following example may be relevant:

  TYPE t
    TYPE(t2),POINTER :: p
  END TYPE
  TYPE t2
    REAL x
  END TYPE
  TYPE(t) v
  TYPE(t2),POINTER :: z
  REAL,POINTER :: q
  ALLOCATE(v%p)
  !
  ! (a)
  !
  z => v%p
  q => z%x
  !
  ! (b)
  !
  q => v%p%x

The pointer assignments following (a) are clearly valid: the first
assigns one pointer to another, and if the answer to Q1 is Yes, the
second one follows from that.

But the (a) statements have the same effect as the (b) statement, so
it would be inconsistent to disallow (b).

Q3. Apparently, substrings never have the INTENT, TARGET or PARAMETER
    attribute.  Is this a deliberate omission?

ANSWER:

Q1: Yes.  P points to an object with the TARGET attribute, and X is a
    subobject of this object.  Therefore, "Q => P%X" is conforming.

Q2: The standard leaves this case unspecified, but the intent is that
    any part of an object with the TARGET attribute should itself
    have the attribute.  An edit is supplied to remedy this omission
    in the standard.

Q3: No, this omission was inadvertant.  An edit is supplied to fix
    this.

EDITS:

[74:33] Append to paragraph
  "A substring has the INTENT, TARGET, or PARAMETER attribute if its
   parent has the attribute, but it never has the POINTER attribute."
{Fix omission.  Text parallels that for array elements and sections.}

[75:22] Delete ", TARGET,".

[75:23] After "." insert
  "A structure component has the TARGET attribute if the parent
   object has the attribute or if any <part-ref> except the rightmost
   has the POINTER attribute."

[110:43-44] Delete
  "be a subobject of an object with the TARGET attribute or it shall
   have".
{Now that propagation of TARGET is fixed, we don't need the weasel
 words.}

NUMBER: 000101
TITLE: Generic resolution
KEYWORDS: generic, argument
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Consider:

  INTERFACE g
    SUBROUTINE s1(p)
      INTERFACE
        SUBROUTINE p
        END
      END INTERFACE
    END
    SUBROUTINE s2(p)
      INTERFACE
        REAL FUNCTION p()
        END
      END INTERFACE
    END
  END INTERFACE
  EXTERNAL procedure
  CALL g(procedure)

The generic interface block seems to satisfy the requirements of
14.1.2.3, in that s2 has more arguments of type REAL than has s1, but
since the data type of "procedure" is not known (it may be a default
REAL function, or it may be a subroutine), the CALL appears to be
ambiguous.

Is this code standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

No, this was not intended to be standard-conforming.
An edit is supplied to correct this oversight.

EDITS:

[277:21-23] Change "arguments" to "data objects" three times.

NUMBER: JP-17
TITLE: Multiple occurrence of namelist group object in namelist group
KEYWORDS: NAMELIST
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

JP-17)

  5.4 3rd paragraph after R545 and constraints states that:

  "A namelist group object may be a member of more than one
   namelist group."

  Can a namelist group object occur more than once in one
  namelist group?

  Is the following NAMELIST statement standard conforming?

        NAMELIST /NLIST/A,B,A

ANSWER: Yes.

DISCUSSION:

  Sections 5.4 "NAMELIST Statement" and 10.9 "Namelist Formatting"
  in Fortran 95 do not disallow multiple occurrences of a namelist
  group object in a namelist group.  This is also true in Fortran 90.
  Therefore the multiple occurrences are standard conforming.

EDITS:  None.

NUMBER: JP-24
TITLE: The bnf term shared-term-do-construct
KEYWORDS: DO, BNF
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

JP-24)
  In 8.1.4.2, second constraint below R833 states that:

  "The do-term-shared-stmt shall be identified with a label
   and all of the label-do-stmts of the shared-term-do-construct
   shall refer to the same label."

  This implies a label-do-stmts of the outer-most outer-shared-
  do-construct will permit not to refer to the same label, because
  shared-term-do-construct does not include outer-most outer-
  shared-do-construct.

  So the term "shared-term-do-construct" should be changed to
  "inner-share-do-construct and outer-shared-do-construct."

DISCUSSION:

  There is a typographical error in the question - "8.1.4.2"
  should read "8.1.4.1.2".

  The following amplification of the question was provided at the
  August 2000 WG5 meeting:

  The present BNF does not preclude the following as a single
  construct:

    do 10 i=1,5     ! outer
     do 20 j=1,5    ! outer
      do 20 k=1,5   ! outer
       do 20 l=1,5  ! inner
         ...
    20 continue     ! shared

ANSWER:

  Agreed.  There is a minor change in the suggested replacement text.

EDIT:

  [127:29.5] Replace "<shared-term-do-construct>" by
   "<outer-shared-do-construct>".

  {The intention is to alter the second line of the second constraint
   following R833.  The line numbering is awry in the F95 copy being
   used.}
