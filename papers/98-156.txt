       Subject: DTIO fixes
       
       The following edits are in response to Richard Maine's
       comments on DTIO edits as contained in paper J3/98-144.
       
       JOR has decided to accept Richard Maine's suggestion to
       allow "recursive" I/O to internal units all of the time,
       not just when a parent DTIO statement is active.
       
       Edits:
       
         Section 9.8 [181:3], change
           "another input/output statement"
             to
           "another input/output statement that references an
            external unit"
       
         Section 9.9 [181:8+], add several new paragraphs:
           "A data transfer statement that is executed while
           another data transfer statement is being executed
           is called a recursive data transfer statement.
       
           "A recursive data transfer statement shall not identify
           an external unit.".
       
           "The list items in a recursive data transfer statement
           shall not contain any portion of any established format
           specification nor be in or associated with any internal
           unit for a currently executing data transfer statement.".
