Discussion
----------

The EVENT_QUERY function defines its INTENT(OUT) argument COUNT in the
case of an error condition.  This is contrary to the semantics for
Atomic subroutines. The proposed solution is to change EVENT_QUERY to
be in the class Subroutine.

Note that 8.5.2 Segments para 2 already allows event variables to be
referenced without regard to segment ordering, independent of whether
EVENT_QUERY is an atomic subroutine.

Additionally, the STAT argument description omits the description of
how it is defined.

Edits are provided for these issues.


Edits to 15-007r2:
------------------

[327:Table 13.1] For the EVENT_QUERY entry in Table 13.1, in the Class
column, change "A" to "S".

[359:13] In 13.8.71 EVENT_QUERY, in the Class designation, change
"Atomic subroutine" to "Subroutine".

[359:16] In 13.8.71 EVENT_QUERY, at the end of the description of the
EVENT argument add:
"The EVENT argument is accessed atomically with respect to the
execution of EVENT POST statements in unordered segments, in exact
analogy to atomic subroutines."

[359:21] In 13.8.71 EVENT_QUERY, append to the end of the description
of the STAT argument:
"If the STAT argument is present, it is assigned a processor-dependent
positive value if an error condition occurs; otherwise it is assigned
the value zero.  If the STAT argument is not present and an error
condition occurs, error termination is initiated."
