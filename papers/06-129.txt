Subject: Ragged allocatable/pointer co-arrays

________________________
Background:
________________________

The current CAF specification is written so that co-arrays have the
same size on all images---I call these symmetric co-arrays. This
makes co-arrays behave in some ways as if they were arrays of rank
which is the sum of the rank and co-rank, and they can actually be
implemented that way on true shared-memory systems. In particular,
this property also holds for allocatable co-arrays, whose allocation
is a collective operation and the same allocation statement must be
executed on all images:

REAL, ALLOCATABLE, DIMENSION(:)[*] :: symm_alloc
ALLOCATE(symm_alloc(100)) ! Collective synchronizing operation

It is clear that user codes also have need for ragged allocatable
co-arrays having different size on different images. For this purpose,
the current CAF specification suggests using the same technique used
in serial Fortran: Allocatable/pointer array components of derived
types, and in particular, co-arrays of such a derived-type:

TYPE :: RALLOCATABLE
   REAL, ALLOCATABLE, DIMENSION(:) :: array
END TYPE
TYPE(RALLOCATABLE) :: ragged_alloc[*]

The justification used for this choice has been that it
simplifies the proposal and that it provides all the needed
functionality, at the minor cost of requiring somewhat ackward
component-selection syntax such as ragged_alloc[1]%array(3)
instead of ragged_alloc(3)[1]. However, the "simplification"
comes at the cost of other complications, especially when pointer
components are involved. Namely, it is not desirable to allow one
image to allocate/deallocate memory on another image, and, for
pointer components, these components must point to local memory and
therefore another image cannot manipulate their pointer association
status. This leads to a host of special restrictions, for example,
intrinsic assignment of such derived types is forbidden or restricted:

ragged_alloc[3]=ragged_alloc ! No reallocation or pointer components
allowed

Additionally, it was decided not to allow co-array subobjects to appear
as actual argument corresponding to INTENT(OUT) or INTENT(INOUT) dummy
arguments in part because of the possibility of pointer/allocatable
components and the ensuing complications.

There are also implementation issues with such pointer/allocatable
components. On certain cluster architectures, very efficient
(low-latency, low-CPU-overhead) one-sided communication is achieved via
Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) operations. These often require that
the memory involved in this transfer be registered with the Network
Interface Card (NIC) so that the virtual-to-physical memory translation
can be registered in the NIC tables and also so that the pages involved
can be pinned (frozen) with the OS. Using local allocatable/pointer
arrays, even though they may be components of a co-array, does not
allow the compiler to do proper memory registration/allocation and thus
maximize performance. Instead, memory for such ragged co-arrays could
be allocated inside procedures where the co-array parent is not visible
and thus there are no hints that co-arrays are involved. Furthermore,
pointer components can be pointed to any local object and later
used to perform data transfer on it, without any hint during the
pointer-assignment statement that coarrays are involved, thus not
allowing proper memory registration. Even on shared-memory systems,
and in particular mixed SMP cluster machines, shared memory segments
(memory shared among the different processes/images on one SMP)
should be allocated via special OS calls.

I believe that the complications described above far outweigh
the claimed benefits of the proposed CAF specification for ragged
co-arrays. I believe allocatable/pointer components should simply
not be allowed as sub-objects of co-arrays:

TYPE(T), DIMENSION(?)[?], ? :: coarray
   ! Not allowed if T has pointer/allocatable components

This automatically avoids all the problems with such components.

However, the problem of how to provide for ragged co-arrays still
remains. I propose to revert back to previously discussed alternatives,
namely, using an <assumed-shape-spec> for the <co-array-spec> to
declare a new type of co-array, a ragged pointer/allocatable co-array:

REAL, ALLOCATABLE, DIMENSION(:,:)[3,*] :: ragged_alloc
REAL, POINTER, DIMENSION(:,:)[3,*] :: ragged_pointer

These are different from and not interchangeable with symmetric
(non-ragged) allocatable (or pointer, in the future revisions)
co-arrays. It is expected that they will be implemented using
arrays [of size num_images()] of (local) array descriptors, rather
than as co-array descriptors as would symmetric arrays. Additional
shared/global data-structures, such as address-translation tables,
might be associated with each of these arrays on some architectures.

As an in the current proposal, one cannot declare a symmetric pointer
co-array, even though this has obvious meaning (see Appendix 2 in
Numrich/Reid), as this can be left for future extensions and is not
as important/useful:

REAL, POINTER, DIMENSION(:)[:] :: coarray_ptr ! Not allowed

We of course already allow the ALLOCATABLE equivalent in the current
CAF spec, leading to a symmetric allocatable co-array.

________________________
Specification:
________________________

A <co-array-spec> that is an <assumed-shape-spec> is used to declare
ragged/asymmetric allocatable co-arrays:

REAL, ALLOCATABLE, DIMENSION(:)[*] :: ragged_alloc

In the ALLOCATE statement, no co-dimension is given, and the shape
can be different on different images. Furthermore, no synchronization
is implied, i.e., the allocation is a local process (however, the
processor may allocate special memory):

IF(this_image()<10) ALLOCATE(ragged_alloc(10*this_image()))

A ragged allocatable co-array may not be an actual argument
corresponding to an allocatable dummy, unless the dummy is also a
ragged allocatable co-array. That is, one cannot disguise it as a
local allocatable array or as a (symmetric, non-ragged) allocatable
co-array. For ragged allocatable co-arrays this guarantees that memory
will always be allocated/deallocated via a special allocator.

Identical rules apply to ragged pointer co-arrays:

REAL, POINTER, DIMENSION(:)[*] :: ragged_ptr

Additionally, one needs rules for pointer assignment: Ragged
co-array pointers may be pointed to local arrays, without any
<co-dimension-spec>:

ragged_ptr=>local_target ! Note: This is of questionable value?

In all other respects, ragged co-arrays act like symmetric
alloctable/pointer co-arrays. In particular, if a ragged co-array is
a component of a derived type, it acts just like symmetric co-arrays,
namely, all parent objects must be scalar.
