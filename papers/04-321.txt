NUMBER: 
TITLE: Component value for pointer components
KEYWORDS: component, value, pointer
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION: According to 4.5.7, the component value for an
allocatable component includes the bounds if the component
is allocated.  However, no mention is made of the bounds
of pointer components.  It is possible for pointers with
different bounds to be associated with the same target
(13.7.13); therefore, I conclude that the bounds are not
part of the association.

Is it standard conforming for a processor to print 1 as
a result of the folloing program?

  program me
    type t
      integer, pointer :: p(:)
    end type t
    type(t) :: x
    allocate(x%p(3:5))
    call sub(x)
  contains
    subroutine sub(y)
      type(t), value :: y
      write (*,*) lbound(y%p)
    end subroutine sub
  end program me

ANSWER:

No, a processor is required to print 3 as a result of the above
program.  The component value of a pointer component should have
included its bounds.  An edit is provided to fix this oversight.

EDITS:

  [62:11] Before the ";" insert "and, if it is associated, its bounds"
