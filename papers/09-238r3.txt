In 09-238, Nick Maclaren points out that if a C++ procedure is called 
(directly or indirectly) from Fortran, it might bypass the return 
mechanism of an executing Fortran procedure by using throw/catch.
He suggested adding a note to discourage this. HPC prefers to add
the general rule to normative text and mention exception handling in
a note. 

Draft 09-007r2:[439:20-21] says: "A procedure defined by means other
than Fortran shall not alter the floating-point status (14.7) other
than by setting an exception flag to signaling.". Therefore, we do not
feel the changes suggested in the second part of 09-238 are needed.


EDITS 

[312:14+] In 12.6.3 Definition and invocation of procedures by means
other than Fortran, after para 1 add a new paragraph and Note:

"A procedure defined by means other than Fortran that is invoked by a
Fortran procedure and does not cause termination of execution, shall
return to its caller.

NOTE 12.47a
Examples of code that might cause a transfer of control that bypasses
the normal return mechanism of a Fortran procedure are setjmp and
longjmp in C and exception handling in other languages. No such
behavior is permitted by this part of ISO/IEC 1539."
