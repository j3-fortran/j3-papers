Subject: Resolution for 754R
Date:    2005 November 10


The Fortran committee is pleased to see work progressing toward
an interchange format defined
for decimal floating point arithmetic, and  will endeavor to
specify a binding to the type specified by 754R in its forthcoming
standard ("Fortran 2008").

Fortran defers to the wishes of the Cobol
community with regard to the format of decimal arithmetic.

Fortran wishes to encourage 754r to make a definite choice of formats,
and to favor that format which it expects is most favorable to
implementation in actual hardware.
