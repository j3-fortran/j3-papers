Subject: Interoperability edits
Date: 24 July 2002

This is a follow-up to the paper on interoperability (02-188) that I sent to the last meeting. I am, of course, delighted that so many of my suggestions were accepted. I would like to thank Richard Maine for comments on an early draft of this paper. 

One on my aims in 02-188 was to make it clear that interoperability for a Fortran entity is something that the compiler and the human reader can determine from the Fortran code. I think that J3 accepted this view since it agreed to my edit that now appears on 384:2:
  The following subclauses define the conditions under which a Fortran
  entity is interoperable. If a Fortran entity is interoperable, an
  equivalent entity may be defined by means of C and the Fortran entity
  is said to be interoperable with the C entity. There does not have to
  be such an interoperating C entity.
However, some of my suggested edits, needed to carry this view through were not passed. I am therefore trying again, but these edits are honed in the light of comments in 02-188r2 and from Richard. 


78:2-3. Change to
   The BIND attribute for a variable or common block specifies that it
   is interoperable and has external linkage (15.3).
[There is a problem in that many interoperable variables will not have the BIND attribute. The BIND sttribute makes a variable global (if it is not already) and adds external linkage.  This will usually not be wanted for a variable used as an actual argument in a call to a C procedure and is not allowed if it is itself a dummy argument. The new wording aims to make this clearer to the reader.]

88:5+. Delete internal note.
88:10. Add to the end of C558 'and the entity shall be an interoperable
    variable (15.2.4, 15.2.5)'. 
88:14. Change '15.2' to  '15.2.4, 15.2.5'.
88:15. Change 'entities' to 'variables and common blocks'. 
[I agree with what Richard says in the internal note and would also like to point out that the standard carefully uses different bnf for types (BIND(C), see 42:1), variables and common blocks (language-binding-spec, see 70:7 and 71:33), and procedures (proc-language-binding-spec). This means that the only reasonable interpretation of 5.2.4 is that it applies only to variables and common blocks. My edits make this clear to the reader.]

277:7-8. Change to 

C1238 (R1225) If proc-language-binding-spec is specified for a procedure,
      each of the procedure's dummy arguments shall be an interoperable
      variable (15.2.4, 15.2.5) or an interoperable procedure
      (15.2.6).  If proc-language-binding-spec is specified for a
      function, the function result shall be an interoperable
      variable.
[I did not get this right in 02-188. These are conditions that are buried in the text in 15.2.6 and are better as constraints IMHO, since they are conditions on whether the procedure is ever interoperable.]

282:17-19. Change to
    If the interface of a procedure has a <proc-language-
    binding-spec>, the procedure is interoperable (15.4).
[The present wording is not consistent with the previous paragraph and suggests that there has to be a corresponding C function.]
 
386:1+. Add paragraph:
  A Fortran derived type is <<interoperable>> if it has the BIND
  attribute.
and move lines 8-14 to follow this. After these, add
   NOTE 15.10a
   The syntax rules and their constraints require that a derived type
   that is interoperable has components that are all data objects that
   are interoperable. No component is permitted to be a procedure or
   allocatable, but a component of type C_PTR may hold the C address
   of such an entity.
[See second paragraph of this paper. Note also that my edits for what is now 387:2-3 and 387:7-8 were accepted.]

388:1+. Add:
   A Fortran procedure is <<interoperable>> if it has the BIND
   attribute, that is, if its interface is specified with a
   <proc-language-binding-spec>.
[See second paragraph of this paper.]

388:10-11. Delete.
[See constraint at 277:7-8, above.]

390:3-4. Replace the sentence 'A variable ... linkage.' by
   'The common block or variable shall be specified to have the BIND 
   attribute.'  
and start a new paragraph thereafter.
[The present sentence is not strong enough and is wrong because it is contradicted by 390:7.  A new paragraph is needed to balance the paragaph that starts at line 8.]

390:7. Move this line to 14+. [It applies to common blocks, too.] 

391:9&11. Change 'extern' to 'external'.

391:13-15. Change to
   A procedure that is is interoperable may be defined either by means
   other than Fortran or by means of a Fortran subprogram, but not
   both.
and delete the internal note. 

391:20. Change to 'A reference to such a procedure'.
[The present wording makes the reader think that we talking about something different.]

411:27-30. Change to

 (16) When execution of a RETURN or END statement causes a variable to
      become undefined, any variable of type C_PTR becomes undefined if
      its value is the C address of any part of the variable that
      becomes undefined.

 (17) When a variable with the TARGET attribute is deallocated, any
      variable of type C_PTR becomes undefined if its value is the C
      address of any part of the variable that is deallocated.

[A change here was rejected in 02-188r2 because 'Subgroup believes that association is well-defined for variables of type C_PTR and that no new form of association is introduced'.  Perhaps I have missed something, but I have not found the place where it well-defined. All I can find is in the name of C_ASSOCIATED and its informal description.]

418:31-31. Delete. [Not as in 02-188r2 and out of order.]

419:5+. Add <<interoperable>> (15.2). The property of a Fortran entity that ensures that an equivalent entity may be defined by means of a companion processor. [As in 02-188r2]
