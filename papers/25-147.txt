The OpenMP language committee has continued work towards an OpenMP 6.1
release in November 2026. There will be an F2F meeting in Paris Jun 23
- 27. Topics to be discussed include:

* revisit support for reserving parallelism in target regions

* clarify behavior relating to mapping Fortran pointer and allocatable
  dummy arguments to devices

* new loop transformation constructs such as fission and loop-blocking

* non-commutative reduction support

* some fixes to syntax for atomic structured blocks, particular on
  update vs capture

* support for scalable vector implementations

Recent updates for OpenMP 6.1 that have been accepted include:

* support for dynamic shared memory in targets (via dyn_groupprivate
  clause and related APIs)

* expand cases where declare target directives are implied for Fortran
  to include declarations in same source file

* extend fuse construct (loop fusion) to apply to loop nests with
  depth greater than 1

An updated Examples document with more OpenMP 6.0 examples is also in
the works and should be released within the next month or so. Includes
the following new examples:

* fuse construct

* stripe construct

* use of free-agent threads

* transparent task dependences (i.e., dependences between non-sibling
  tasks)

* extended "compound" directives

* target_data extensions
