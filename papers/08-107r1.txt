1. Introduction

The definition of the term subcomponent is defective.
So is the definition of the term "ultimate component";
it limits itself to types but the standard uses it on
objects as well as types.

Direct component is not defective as it stands, but it
would be more useful if it were applicable to objects
as well as types.

2. Edits to 08-007

[12:24,25] Delete "of a type", twice.
{Make direct component applicable to objects as well.}

[12:32] Delete "of a type".
{Make ultimate component applicable to objects as well.}

[23:20] Replace definition of subcomponent with
  "of a structure, direct component that is a subobject of that structure"
and move to be a subterm of "component" at [12:30-1].
{Fix subcomponent.}

[64:3] "components" ->
       "components, direct components, and ultimate components"
twice, and insert ", respectively" before ".".
{Make this claim more comprehensive.}

Delete UTI 123 if resolved.
