Title: Negative zero

Submitted by: J3

Status: For Consideration

References: FCD §4.4.2

Basic Functionality: The constraint in §4.4.2 of the standard requires behavior
that is inconsistent with common expectations.  If all
intrinsic functions are prohibited from recognizing the
difference between positive and negative zero, then the
following results are required (all of which, to meet
common expectations should be different):

AIMAG((0.0, -0.0)) -> 0.0
CMPLX(-0.0, -0.0) -> (0.0, 0.0)
CONJG((0.0, -0.0)) -> (0.0, -0.0) !
DBLE(-0.0) -> 0.0d0
DPROD(0.0, -0.0) -> 0.0d0
MAX(-1.0, -0.0) -> 0.0
MIN(1.0, -0.0) -> 0.0
REAL(-0.0d0) -> 0.0
ASIN(-0.0) -> 0.0
ATAN(-0.0) -> 0.0
SIN(-0.0) -> 0.0
SINH(-0.0) -> 0.0
TAN(-0.0) -> 0.0
TANH(-0.0) -> 0.0
TRANSFER(-0.0, 0.0) -> 0.0
MERGE(-0.0, 1.0, .true.) -> 0.0

There are other cases that are also arguably controlled by
the existing constraint (in which -0.0 appears as a value
inside an array argument, for example).  None of the above
results meet common expectations.

Rationale: Many existing implementations already ignore this
constraint.  To force them to conform would decrease
their quality of implementation.  Of those intrinsic
functions relevant to this constraint, all should
distinguish positive from negative zero, rather than
being prohibited from doing so.

Estimated Impact: Little.  Simply eliminating the constraint will require
no changes to existing implementations.  Existing Fortran
programs already have to accomodate negative zeros as
results from implementations that violate the constraint.
In future, people will more often want behavior consistent
with usual practice among the rest of the numerical
software community.  Eliminating the constraint will
permit implementations to accomodate this trend.

Detailed Specification: Referring to the FCD:
Delete lines 38:3-4
Change line 38:5 to:
   (2) as the scalar-numeric-expr in an arithmetic IF.
