Subject: Resolution for 754R
Date:    2005 November 9


The Fortran committee is pleased to see an interchange format defined
for decimal floating point arithmetic, and  will endeavor to
specify a binding to the type specified by 754R in its forthcoming
standard ("Fortran 2008").

Fortran respectfully defers to the wishes of the Cobol
community with regard to decimal arithmetic.

Fortran wishes to encourage 754r to make a definite choice of formats,
and to favor that format which it expects is most favorable to
implementation in actual hardware.
