Note 8.17 on page 189 is seen as needing improvement. An alternative
is to not specify that the IND array is a permutation, but rather just
has no repeated elements. The second subscript on the array A seems to
add nothing.


Edits to J3/07-007r1

[189:Note 8.17] Replace the first sentence of Note 8.17 with "The
following example represents a case in which the user knows that there
are no repeated values in the index array IND."

Replace the example source code with:

INTEGER :: A(N), IND(N)

DO CONCURRENT (I=1:M)
    A(IND(I)) = I
END DO
