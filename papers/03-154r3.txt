1. Comment TC1

   Provide more support for ISO 10646.  

    ISO 10646 support is incomplete in that there is no support for:
    - any of the file formats defined by ISO 10646; different file
      format choices will inhibit portability,
    - reading/writing numeric data to/from 10646 variables, and
    - mixing ASCII and 10646 data, despite 10646 being a superset of ASCII.
    Additionally, there are restrictions on reading/writing ASCII
    characters in a 10646 environment which appear to be impossible to
    check.

    The following features should be added to the standard to correct this:
    - allow the file format to be specified (to be UTF-8).
    - reading/writing numeric data to 10646 variables.
    - reading default character or ASCII data into 10646 variables.
    - assignment of default character or ASCII variables to 10646 variables.
    These requirements only to apply to processors which support ISO 10646.

    Edits will be needed to sections 4.4.4, 7.4.1, 9.4.5.8 and 10.6
    (pages 38, 139-140, 183 and 224).

2. The effect of ISO 10646

The nondefault character features of F95 were designed in the 1980s and
were based on experience of handling extended character sets in byte-based
systems with the help of escape characters. The number of bytes needed for
a character varied so there was no hope of standardizing position editing
when a nondefault character was skipped (see [232:8-9]).

ISO 10646 changes this significantly. Every character has a standardized
4-byte representation and there are standardized methods for compressing a
string of 4-byte characters into strings of octets (UTF-8) or 16-bit values
(UTF-16). If the file is known to be UTF-8 formatted, the system can decode
each record read into a buffer of 4-byte characters, and can encode each
record written from such a buffer (or base its processing on this
model). Position editing becomes possible.

3. Discussion

- (7-bit) ASCII is a 1-byte-coded proper subset of ISO 10646.  It is not
  possible to detect, by examining the file contents, the difference between
  an ASCII formatted file and a UTF-8 formatted file with all characters <=127,
  because they are bit-for-bit identical.

- People who are doing internationalised i/o using our facilities deserve
  similar support to those doing plain ASCII.  They should certainly be able to
  read whole records into 10646 variables for parsing, and be able to use the
  numeric conversion facilities on substrings thereof, without having to
  manually convert, character by character using ACHAR and IACHAR substrings,
  to default character.

- From F90 to F95, due to typesetting difficulties, we lost the international
  characters in what is now 4.4.4, note 4.14.  It's trivial to do Greek letters
  and maths symbols in LaTeX, so this should be improved.  Preferably the F90
  example could be reinstated.  (There were examples of Cyrillic, Hindi,
  Magyar and Nihongo characters in section 4.3.2.1).

- Converting 7-bit ASCII to ISO 10646 is trivial, as it is a proper subset.
  The only vendor we know to have EBCDIC for default character does not
  consider this extra wrinkle to be problematic, as the necessary conversion
  tables are already present for the ACHAR and IACHAR intrinsics.

- There are at least two obvious ways of specifying a file format of UTF-8: the
  simplest is to allow FORM="UTF-8" as specifying not only that the file is
  formatted but also that its encoding form is UTF-8; the other is to add a new
  i/o specifier, e.g. ENCODING="UTF-8".  In either case, for backward
  compatibility with existing programs the INQUIRE statement should continue to
  return the same values for a FORM= enquiry and have a new ENCODING= enquiry
  to detect the encoding form.  For consistency, this paper recommends that
  ENCODING= be used on the OPEN statement as well.

4. Specification

4.1. Basic requirements:

UTF-8 file support:
- That a specifier of ENCODING="UTF-8" be permitted on the OPEN statement; this
  is only for formatted files, and specifies that the encoding form is UTF-8.
  It is only allowed if the processor supports ISO 10646.
- That an ENCODING= enquiry be added to INQUIRE.  This should be permitted but
  not required to detect the encoding form of files that are not connected;
  for connected files, it just returns the encoding form of the connection.
- Any data written to a UTF-8 file may be read back into an ISO 10646 character
  variable.
- Allow numeric/logical data to be written to/read from a UTF-8 file.
- Allow ASCII/default/10646 character data to be written to/read from a UTF-8
  file.

ISO 10646 internal files:
- That internal i/o be permitted to/from ISO 10646 character variables.
- Allow numeric/logical data to be written to/read from a 10646 character
  variable.
- Allow default/ASCII/10646 character data to be written to/read from a 10646
  character variable.

Character assignment:
- That ASCII/default characters be assignable to ISO 10646 character variables.

4.2. Optional requirements:
- That ISO 10646 characters be assignable to ASCII character variables.
  {For symmetry.  This is safe when the ISO 10646 character variables contain
   characters up to CHAR(127,10646); otherwise information is lost.}

5. Technical Flaw in ACHAR intrinsic

The ACHAR intrinsic has a technical flaw and is excessively limited.

The technical flaw is that it says that it returns the
  "character in position I of the ASCII collating sequence, provided the
   processor is capable of representing that character"
Since the return type of ACHAR is default character, the question is not
whether the processor can represent the ASCII char in one of its supported
character sets, but whether it can represent it in its default character set.

The excessive limitation is that it only returns default character.  If the
processor has any non-ASCII non-default character set, ACHAR is pretty useless.
The limitation on IACHAR that it can only be used on default character is
similarly excessive.

We recommend that a KIND argument be added to ACHAR and that IACHAR should
accept any character type.  Edits are included.

6. Edits to 02-007r3

[24:17] Before "nondefault" insert
  "ASCII and ISO 10646 character sets are specified by the relevant standard;
   the characters available in other".
[24:17] After "not specified" insert "by this standard".
{UNRELATED: This edit is not related to UK comment TC1, but the text does not
appear to be correct as it stands.}

[40:13+]
"The collating sequence for the ASCII character type
is the ASCII collating sequence.
The collating sequence for the ISO 10646 character type
is as defined by ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000."

[139:9+5-] Insert
  "ISO 10646, ASCII, or                ISO 10646, ASCII, or default character
    default character"
[139:9+5] Change first "character" to "other character".
{Allow ASCII and default chars to be assigned to UCS4 chars and vice versa.}

[140:11-12] Delete "shall ... but".
[141:4+] Insert new paragraph:
  "If the <variable> and <expr> have different kind type parameters, each
   character <c> in the <expr> is converted to the kind type parameter of
   <variable> by ACHAR(IACHAR(<c>),KIND(<variable>))."
[141:4+2+] Append to note
  "When assigning a character expression to a variable of a different kind,
   each character of the expression that is not representable in the kind of
   the variable is replaced by a processor-dependent character."
{Semantics for assignment of ASCII/default chars to UCS4 and vice versa.}

[142:16] After "." insert
  "If <x1> is of type default character, ASCII character, or ISO 10646
   character, <x2> shall not be of type default character, ASCII character, or
   ISO 10646 character."
{Actually, [142:15-16] appears to be wrong, in that it takes no account of
 rank mismatches.  This will be discussed in a separate paper.}

[178:21,22] Delete italicised "default-", twice.

[181:15+] Insert "<<or>> ENCODING = <scalar-default-char-expr>"
{New ENCODING= specifier.}

[182:36+] Insert new section
  "9.4.5.6a ENCODING= specifier in the OPEN statement

   The <scalar-default-char-expr> shall evaluate to UTF-8 or DEFAULT.  The
   ENCODING= specifier is permitted only for a connection for formatted
   input/output.  The value UTF-8 specifies that the encoding form of the file
   is UTF-8 as specified by ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000.  Such a file is called a
   <<Unicode>> file, and all characters therein are of ISO 10646 character
   type.  The value UTF-8 shall not be specified if the processor does not
   support the ISO 10646 character type.  The value DEFAULT specifies that the
   encoding form of the file is processor-dependent.  If this specifier is
   omitted in an OPEN statement that initiates a connection, the default value
   is DEFAULT."
{New ENCODING="UTF-8" specifier to select UTF-8 encoded files.  We define the
 term "Unicode" partly to ease later edits, partly leaving the door open for
 extension to UTF-16 should that prove popular.}

[208:14+] Insert
  " <<or>> ENCODING = <scalar-default-char-variable>"
{New enquiry for INQUIRE.}

[210:12+] Insert new section
  "9.9.1.8a ENCODING= specifier in the INQUIRE statement

   The <scalar-default-char-variable> in the ENCODING= specifier is assigned
   the value UTF-8 if the file is connected for formatted input/output with an
   encoding form of UTF-8, and is assigned the value UNDEFINED if the file is
   connected for unformatted input/output.  If there is no connection, it is
   assigned the value UTF-8 if the processor is able to determine that the
   encoding form of the file is UTF-8.  If the processor is unable to
   determine the encoding form of the file, the variable is assigned the value
   UNKNOWN.

   Note 9.60a
   The value assigned may be something other than UTF-8, UNDEFINED, or UNKNOWN
   if the processor supports other specific encoding forms (e.g. UTF-16BE)."
{New enquiry for INQUIRE.  The return value for a formatted file that is not
 UTF-8 is deliberately left unspecified to facilitate support of other - past
 or future - encoding forms such as ASCII and EBCDIC.  We also wish to allow
 a processor to use UTF-8 by default, therefore there is no return value of
 DEFAULT (we want it to get UTF-8 in that case).}

[224:8-12] Delete "Characters ...kind.".
[224:14+] Insert new paragraphs:
  "During input from a Unicode file,
   (a) characters in the record that correspond to an ASCII character variable
       shall have a position in the ISO 10646 character type collating sequence
       of 127 or less, and
   (b) characters in the record that correspond to a default character variable
       shall be representable in the default character type.
   During input from a non-Unicode file,
   (a) characters in the record that correspond to a character variable shall
       have the kind of the character variable, and
   (b) characters in the record that correspond to a numeric or logical
       variable shall be of default character type.

   During output to a Unicode file, all characters transmitted to the record
   are of ISO 10646 character type.  If a character input/output list item or
   character string edit descriptor contains a character that is not
   representable in the ISO 10646 character type, the result is processor-
   dependent.
   During output to a non-Unicode file, characters transmitted to the record as
   a result of processing a character string edit descriptor or as a result of
   evaluating a numeric, logical, or default character data entity, are of type
   default character."
{Specify what is required for input, and what happens with output.  Separate
 paragraphs are provided for input and output.  The "not representable in ...
 10646 ... processor-dependent" sentence is probably unnecessary.}

[232:9] After "," insert
  "and the unit is an internal file of type default character or an external
   non-Unicode file,"
{T, TL, TR and X can all work properly in a 10646 char string or Unicode file.}

[236:7,31,32] After "default" insert ", ASCII, or ISO 10646".
{Extend list-directed input for character to ASCII and 10646.}

[291:6] Before ")" insert "[, KIND]".
{Add an optional KIND arg to ACHAR.}

[296:22] After "<<I>>" add "<<[, KIND]>>".
[296:26] Change "<<Argument.>>" to "<<Arguments.>>" and break line afterwards.
[296:26+] Insert
  "KIND (optional)   shall be a scalar integer initialization expression."
[296:27] Replace with a copy of [303:5-7].
[296:29] Before ";" insert "in the character type of the result".
[296:31] Change "processor" to "default character type".
{Add an optional KIND arg to ACHAR, and fix infelicities in the exposition.}

[315:18] Delete "default".
{Allow IACHAR on any character kind.
