Subject: Edits for M.5: Extend Max and Min Intrinsics to Character Type
References:   X3J3/96-007r1, X3J3/96-131r1, J3/97-156r1, J3/97-207

PROPOSAL:

Extend the intrinsic functions Max, Min, MaxLoc, MinLoc, MaxVal, and MinVal to
accept arguments of character data type.

PROPOSED ADDITIONAL EDITS:

Note: Edits that were approved at Meeting 141 (May 1997) are shown in docment
J3/97-007R1 (Sep 1997). Page and line references below are to docment
J3/97-007R1 (Sep 1997).

Editor: Please use a blank character where # appears in the examples below.

[224: 14+] Add paragraph:
The arguments to MAX or MIN may be character expressions. The largest or
smallest character value is the one that would be selected by application of
intrinsic relational operators: i.e., the collating sequence for characters
with the kind type parameter of the arguments is applied.

[227: 24+] Add paragraph:
The argument of MAXVAL or MINVAL may be a character array. The largest or
smallest character value is the one that would be selected by application of
intrinsic relational operators: i.e., the collating sequence for characters
with the kind type parameter of the arguments is applied.

[228: 11+] Add paragraph:
The argument of MAXLOC or MINLOC may be a character array. The largest or
smallest character value is the one that would be selected by application of
intrinsic relational operators: i.e., the collating sequence for characters
with the kind type parameter of the arguments is applied.

[258: 30] Add sentence: For character arguments, if the selected argument is
shorter than the longest argument the result is padded with blanks on the
right to the length of the longest argument.

[258: 31] Add examples: MAX ("Z", "BB") is "Z#", and MAX ( (/ "A", "Z" /), (/
"BB", "Y#" /) ) is (/ "BB", "Z#" /).

[261: 18] Add sentence: For character arguments, if the selected argument is
shorter than the longest argument the result is padded with blanks on the
right to the length of the longest argument.

[261: 19] Add examples: MIN ("A", "YY") is "A#", and MIN ( (/ "Z", "A" /), (/
"YY", "B#" /) ) is (/ "YY", "A#" /).

BACKGROUND:

Specification and Syntax were approved at Meeting 138 (August 1996) - see
X3J3/96-131r1. Edits were approved at Meeting 141 (May 1997). The edits in
this paper are intended to supply additional informative text.
