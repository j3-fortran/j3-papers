Discussion

The current restrictions on variables referenced or defined in the
body of a DO CONCURRENT construct include the following [177:13-14]:

  "A variable that is referenced in an iteration shall either be
  previously defined during that iteration, or shall not be defined or
  become undefined during any other iteration of the current execution
  of the construct."

Variables that are defined then used in the same iteration are
effectively local to the iteration. A user can make this clearer by
using a BLOCK. A Note is provided for this.

[177:28-] In 8.1.6.7 Restrictions on DO CONCURRENT constructs, after
Note 8.9, add a new Note:

"Note 8.9a

  A variable that is effectively local to each iteration of a DO
  CONCURRENT construct can be declared in a BLOCK construct within
  it. For example

   DO CONCURRENT (I = 1:N)
      BLOCK
        REAL :: T
        T = A(I) + B(I)
        C(I) = T + SQRT(T)
      END BLOCK
   END DO
