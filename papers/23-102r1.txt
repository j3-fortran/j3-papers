2. Example
==========

MODULE A

   REQUIREMENT R(T,F)
      TYPE, DEFERRED :: T
      FUNCTION F(x, i) RESULT(y)
         TYPE(T) :: y
         TYPE(T), INTENT(IN) :: x
         INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: i
      END FUNCTION
   END REQUIREMENT
   
   TEMPLATE B(T,F,C)
      REQUIRES R(T,F)            ! provides interface for deferred F
      TYPE, DEFERRED :: T        ! redundant confirmation of T
      INTEGER, CONSTANT :: C(..) ! deferred rank constant

   CONTAINS
      SUBROUTINE SUB(x, i)
         TYPE(T), INTENT(INOUT) :: x
         INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: x
         x = F(x, SUM(C))
      END SUBROUTINE SUB
   END TEMPLATE B

END MODULE A

MODULE B
  USE MODULE A

  TYPE :: MY_TYPE
     REAL :: val
  END TYPE
 
  INSTANTIATE B(MY_TYPE, POWER, [3,4]), ONLY: my_sub => sub

CONTAINS
   FUNCTION POWER(x, i) RESULT(y)
      TYPE(MY_TYPE) :: y
      TYPE(MY_TYPE), INTENT(IN) :: x
      INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: i
      y%val = x%val ** i
   END FUNCTION

   SUBROUTINE DO_SOMETHING(x, n)
      TYPE(MY_TYPE), INTENT(INOUT) :: x
      INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: n

      INTEGER :: i
      DO i = 1, n
         CALL my_sub(x, i)
      END DO
   END SUBROUTINE
END MODULE B


3. Formal Syntax
================

3.1 Deferred entities
--------------------

A deferred entity is an entity, some aspects of which are deferred.  A
deferred entity may appear in a REQUIREMENT or TEMPLATE construct
(3.2, 3.3).  Association with non-deferred entities occurs in the
INSTANTIATE and REQUIRES statements.

A deferred constant is a deferred entity that can appear in constant
expressions with a REQUIREMENT or TEMPLATE construct.

A deferred type is a deferred entity that can appear as a type-spec
within a REQUIREMENT or TEMPLATE construct.

A deferred procedure (3.4.3) is a deferred entity that can appear in
procedure references within a REQUIREMENT or TEMPLATE construct.  A
deferred procedure's interface shall be defined by that REQUIREMENT or
TEMPLATE construct, possibly in terms of deferred types and constants.

3.1.1 Syntax for deferred arguments
-----------------------------------

A deferred argument declaration construct is used to declare
REQUIREMENT or TEMPLATE arguments.

<deferred-arg> <<is>> <deferred-arg-name>

<deferred-arg-decl-construct> <<is>> <deferred-const-declaration-stmt>
                              <<or>> <deferred-proc-declaration-stmt>
                              <<or>> <deferred-type-declaration-stmt>
                              <<or>> <requires-stmt>

<deferred-const-declaration-stmt> <<is>>
           <declaration-type-spec>, <deferred-attr-constant-spec> ::
           <deferred-const-list>

<deferred-attr-constant-spec> <<is>> [<deferred-attr-spec>,]...
                                          CONSTANT
                                          [,<deferred-attr-spec>]...

<deferred-attr-spec> <<is>> CONTIGUOUS
                        <<or>> <dimension-spec>
                        <<or>> <rank-clause>

Constraint: An entity declared in <deferred-const-declaration-stmt>
            shall be INTEGER, LOGICAL, or assumed-length character.

<deferred-const> <<is>> <deferred-const-name>

Constraint: Each <deferred-const> shall appear in a
            <deferred-const-declaration-stmt>.


<deferred-proc-declaration-stmt> <<is>>
     PROCEDURE[(<interface>)] :: <deferred-proc-decl-list>

<deferred-proc-decl> <<is>> <procedure-entity-name>

Constraint: Each <procedure-entity-name> that appears in a
            <deferred-proc-declaration-stmt> shall appear in
            <deferred-arg-list>.

Constraint: Each <deferred-arg> must appear in a
            <deferred-arg-decl-construct> or as a <function-name> or
            <subroutine-name> within an <interface-body> or a
            <requirement-interface-body>.

Constraint: <generic-spec> shall not apper in <interface-stmt> within
            a <deferred-interface-block>.

<deferred-type-declaration-stmt>
       <<is>>  TYPE, DEFERRED :: <deferred-type-list>

<deferred-type> <<is>> <type-name>

Constraint: Each <deferred-type> shall appear in
            <deferred-arg-list>.

Constraint: A <deferred-arg> declaration shall not have an
            <access-spec> nor shall it appear in a PUBLIC statement.

Note: Deferred arguments are local identifiers and are not externally
      accessible.


3.1.2 Deferred argument association
-----------------------------------

Actual deferred arguments are specified by either an INSTANTIATE or a
REQUIRES statement.  

<actual-deferred-arg-spec> <<is>>
        [ <keyword> = ] <actual-deferred-arg>

Constraint: Each <keyword> shall be the name of a <deferred-arg> in the
            referenced requirement or template.

In the absence of an argument keyword, an actual deferred argument
corresponds to the dummy deferred argument occupying the corresponding
position in <deferred-arg-list>; that is, the first actual deferred
argument corresponds to the first dummy deferred argument in the
reduced list, the second actual deferred argument corresponds to the
second dummy deferred argument in the reduced list, etc.

<actual-deferred-arg> <<is>> <constant-expr>
                      <<or>> <type-spec>
                      <<or>> <generic-spec>
                      <<or>> <procedure-name>
                      
Constraint: <constant-expr> must be type INTEGER, LOGICAL or
            CHARACTER.

Constraint: An <actual-deferred-arg> that is a <constant-expr> shall
            correspond to a <deferred-arg> that is declared as a
            <deferred-const> in the referenced template or requirement.

Constraint: The type and kind of an <actual-deferred-arg> that is a
            <constant-expr> shall have the same type and kind of the
            declaration of the corresponding <deferred-const> in the
            referenced template or requirement.

Constraint: If the shape of the corresponding <deferred-const> in the
            referenced template or requirement is not assumed, then
            <constant-expr> shall have the same shape.

Constraint: If the rank of the corresponding <deferred-const> in the
            referenced template or requirement is not assumed, then
            <constant-expr> shall have the same rank.


Constraint: An <actual-deferred-arg> that is a <type-spec> shall
            correspond to a <deferred-arg> that is declared as a
            <deferred-type> in the referenced template or requirement.

Constraint: If an <actual-deferred-arg> is a <derived-type-spec>, its
            <type-name> shall support intrinsic assignment.

Constraint: An <actual-deferred-arg> that is a <generic-spec> or
            <procedure-name> shall correspond to a <deferred-arg> that
            is declared as a <deferred-proc> in the referenced
            template or requirement.

Constraint: An <actual-deferred-arg> that is a <procedure-name> shall
            be consisntent with the characteristics of the corresponding
            <deferred-proc> in the referenced template or requirement.

Constraint: An <actual-deferred-arg> that is a <generic-spec> shall
            have one specific procedure that is consistent with the
            characteristics of the corresponding <deferred-proc> in
            the referenced template or requirement.

Note: The previous two constraints constitute what is referred to as
      "weak constraints" in other languages.

The <deferred-proc> shall be associated with the specific procedure
that is consistent with the characteristics.

3.2 Syntax for the REQUIREMENT construct
----------------------------------------

A REQUIREMENT is a named collection of deferred argument declarations
intended to facilitate reuse of common patterns within templates and
other requirements.

<requirement>
      <<is>> REQUIREMENT <requirement-name> ( [<deferred-arg-list>] )
                [ <use-stmt> ] ...
                <requirement-specification-construct> ...
             END [REQUIREMENT [<requirement-name>]]

Note: <requirement-interface-body> is defined in section 3.1.1, and
      requirement declaration statements are define in section 3.1.2.

<requirement-specification-construct>
        <<is>> <deferred-arg-decl-construct>
        <<or>> <requirement-interface-body>

Constraint: Each <deferred-arg> shall appear in a
            <requirement-specification-construct>.

Note: If a <procedure-declaration-stmt> appears in the
      <requirement-specification-part> it can only be used to define a
      <requirement-arg>.

Note: A <requirement> is a scoping unit that allows use and host
      association.  Each <deferred-arg> is local to the REQUIREMENT
      construct.

3.2.1 Requirement interface body
--------------------------------

A <requirement-interface-body> declares a <deferred-arg-name> as a
deferred procedure and defines its interface.

<requirement-interface-body>
      <<is>> <function-stmt>
                [ <requirement-interface-specification-part> ]
                <end-function-stmt>
      <<or>> <subroutine-stmt>
                [ <requirement-interface-specification-part> ]
                <end-subroutine-stmt>

Constraint: Each <function-name> and <subroutine-name> in a
            <requirement-interface-body> shall be a
            <deferred-arg-name>.

<requirement-interface-specification-part>
          <<is>> [ <use-stmt> ] ...
                 [ <requirement-interface-declaration-stmt> ] ...

<requirement-interface-declaration-stmt>
          <<is>> <deferred-proc-declaration-stmt>
          <<or>> <requirement-interface-type-declaration-stmt>
          <<or>> <requirement-other-specification-stmt>

<requirement-other-specification-stmt>
        <<is>> <allocatable-stmt>
        <<or>> <asynchronous-stmt>
        <<or>> <codimension-stmt>
        <<or>> <contiguous-stmt>
        <<or>> <dimension-stmt>
        <<or>> <intent-stmt>
        <<or>> <optional-stmt>
        <<or>> <paramter-stmt>
        <<or>> <pointer-stmt>
        <<or>> <target-stmt>
        <<or>> <value-stmt>
        <<or>> <volatile-stmt>

<requirement-interface-type-declaration-stmt>
          <<is>> <declaration-type-spec>
                 [ [ , <requirement-interface-attr-spec> ] ... :: ]
                 <entity-decl-list>

<requirement-interface-attr-spec>
        <<is>> ALLOCATABLE
        <<or>> ASYNCHRONOUS
        <<or>> CODIMENSION <lbracket> <coarray-spec> <rbracket>
        <<or>> CONTIGUOUS
        <<or>> DIMENSION ( <array-spec> )
        <<or>> INTENT ( <intent-spec> )
        <<or>> OPTIONAL
        <<or>> PARAMETER
        <<or>> POINTER
        <<or>> <rank-clause>
        <<or>> TARGET
        <<or>> VALUE
        <<or>> VOLATILE

A <requirement-interface-body> is a scoping unit that has use and host
association.

Note: Unlike <interface-body> of the <inerface-block> or
      <template-interface-block>, <requirement-interface-body> allows
      access to host scope entities by default, and does not allow using
      the IMPORT statement.

3.3 Syntax for the REQUIRES statement
-------------------------------------

A REQUIRES statement provides declarations of deferred arguments by
associating them with the deferred dummy arguments of a REQUIREMENT.

<requires-stmt> <<is>>
      REQUIRES [::] <requirement-name>
            ( [<actual-deferred-arg-spec-list>] )

Constraint: <requirement-name> shall be the name of a previously
            defined <requirement>.

<actual-deferred-arg-spec> <<is>>
        [ <keyword> = ] <actual-deferred-arg>

Constraint: Each <keyword> shall be the name of a <deferred-arg> in the
            referenced requirement.


3.4 Syntax for the TEMPLATE construct
-------------------------------------

A template is a set of declarations, specifications and definitions
that are enabled by instantiation.  A TEMPLATE construct defines
a template.  A template is a scoping unit to which use and host
association and template argument association can be applied.  A
template can appear in the specification part of a program unit or
internal subprogram, or in <template-specification-part> of another
template.

<template> <<is>> <template-stmt>
                      [ <template-specification-part> ]
                      [ <template-subprogram-part> ]     
                      <end-template-stmt>

Note: <template-specification-part> is defined in section 3.3.1, and
      <template-subprogram-part> is defined in section 3.3.2.

A TEMPLATE construct may appear in the specification section of a
program, external subprogram, module, submodule, module subprogram,
internal subprogram, or in <template-specification-part> of another
template.

Note: TEMPLATE cannot appear in the specification section of
      a BLOCK construct.

<template-stmt> <<is>> TEMPLATE <template-name> ([<deferred-arg-list>])

<end-template-stmt> <<is>>  END [TEMPLATE [<template-name>]]

Constraint: If a <template-name> appears in the <end-template-stmt>,
            it shall be identical to the <template-name>
            specified in the <template-stmt>.

Constraint: If a <procedure-declaration-stmt> appears in the
            <template-specification-part> it can only be used to
            declare a <deferred-arg>.


3.4.1 Template specification part
---------------------------------

<template-specification-part> <<is>>
            [ use-stmt ] ...
            [ <template-declaration-construct> ] ...

The implicit mapping within <template> is as if
       IMPLICIT NONE(TYPE,EXTERNAL)
is in place.

<template-declaration-construct> <<is>> <template-specification-construct>
                                 <<or>> <deferred-arg-decl-construct>
                                 <<or>> <requirement>
                                 <<or>> <template>
                                 <<or>> <template-interface-block>

<template-specification-construct> 
                      <<is>> <access-stmt>
                      <<or>> <derived-type-def>
                      <<or>> <dimension-stmt>
                      <<or>> <enum-def>
                      <<or>> <enumeration-type-def>
                      <<or>> <generic-stmt>
                      <<or>> <instantiate-stmt>
                      <<or>> <intrinsic-stmt>
                      <<or>> <parameter-stmt>
                      <<or>> <procedure-declaration-stmt>
                      <<or>> <type-declaration-stmt>

Note: The analogous construct for MODULE is divided into two separate
      constructs: <specific-construct> and
      <other-specification-construct>.  However, subgroup does not see
      the criteria by which items were assigned to either construct.
      Further since TEMPLATE admits fewer items, we have decided to
      merge these two constructs.

Note: A DATA, FORMAT, ENTRY or statement function statement shall not
      appear in the template specification part.

Note: An ALLOCATABLE, ASYNCHRONOUS, BIND, CODIMENSION, CONTIGUOUS,
      EXTERNAL, INTENT, NAMELIST, OPTIONAL, POINTER, PROTECTED, SAVE,
      TARGET, VOLATILE, VALUE, COMMON, or EQUIVALENCE statement shall
      not appear in the template specification part. 


Constraint: An entity declared by <type-declaration-stmt> shall have
            the PARAMETER attribute.

Note: This is to say, the template specification section cannot
      declare variables.

<template-interface-block> <<is>>
       <interface-stmt>
         [ <template-interface-specification> ] ...
         <end-interface-stmt>

<template-interface-specification> <<is>> <interface-body>
                                   <<or>> <template-procedure-stmt>

<template-procedure-stmt> <<is>> PROCEDURE [ :: ] <specific-procedure-list>

Constraint: A <template-procedure-stmt> is allowed only in an
            interface block that has a <generic-spec>.

Constraint: In a <template-interface-block> the MODULE keyword shall
            not appear.

NOTE: Subgroup finds that using "MODULE PROCEDURE" for procedures
      defined in a template to be confusing and unnecessarily verbose.
      Thus, in this context, interfaces should only have "PROCEDURE".


3.4.2 Template subprogram part
------------------------------

<template-subprogram-part> <<is>> <contains-stmt>
                                     [ <template-subprogram> ] ...

<template-subprogram> <<is>> <function-subprogram>
                      <<or>> <subroutine-subprogram>

3.4.3 Additional constraint
---------------------------

Constraint: <template> shall only reference intrinsic procedures,
            procedures with explicit interfaces, and operators.

Note: This constraint expresses the notion of "strong concepts".  In
      particular, this allows a template implementation to be verified
      to be internally consistent.

3.5 Syntax for the INSTANTIATE statement
----------------------------------------

The INSTANTIATE statement specifies an instance of a template
and deferred actual arguments that become associated with the deferred
dummy arguments of that template.

<instantiate-stmt>
     <<is>> INSTANTIATE [::] <template-name> (
            [ <actual-deferred-arg-spec-list> ] ) [, <rename-list> ]
     <<or>> INSTANTIATE [::] <template-name> (
            [ <actual-deferred-arg-spec-list> ] , ONLY : [ <only-list> ]

<actual-deferred-arg-spec> <<is>> [ <keyword> = ] <actual-deferred-arg>

Constraint: Each <keyword> shall be the name of a <deferred-arg> in the
            referenced template.

Constraint: Within an <instantiate-stmt>, <actual-deferred-arg> shall
            not depend on any entity defined within the referenced
            template.

Note: <generic-spec> includes operators, defined assignment and
      defined I/O.  The last may be somewhat awkward to use within a
      template without re-expressing as defined I/O again.

Constraint: <constant-expr> shall be of type integer, logical or
            character.
