Discussion
----------

We accept the editor's first suggestion in UTI 23.

The words "since execution last began" may be removed in most places
because if the same team is made current by several executions of
CHANGE TEAM statements, the requirements being satisfied in the first
r executions allow the counting for execution r+1 to be made over all
executions of the team.

This edit for CHANGE TEAM is included in 16-186r1.
