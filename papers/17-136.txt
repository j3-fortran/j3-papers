Discussion
---------------

Subgroup agrees with the suggestions in 17-102 regarding paper
16-241r2, leading to the following explanations and edits.

It is useful after the constraints on <proc-language-binding-spec> to
have a general waffle paragraph to explain
<proc-language-binding-spec> like we do for ELEMENTAL, PURE, etc.

The constraints on interoperable procedures (15.6.2 Procedures defined
by subprograms, section 15.6.2.1 General, page 330) use two different
formulations:

1. If proc-language-binding-spec is specified for a ....
2. ... of a procedure that has a proc-language-binding-spec ...

The first variant occurs 4 times, the second one 2 times. The first
variant has the advantage of mentioning the important condition up front.

Edits are provided to reformulate the two constraints that are of variant 2
into the format of variant 1.

Separately, C1555 seems to be already covered by C1554, so C1555 is
deleted.

In 18.3.7, the definition of the interoperability of procedures reads:

  "A Fortran procedure is interoperable if ..."

instead of

  "A Fortran procedure is interoperable if and only if ..."

which the preceding interoperability subclauses do for variables.
Since there is no other way a Fortran procedure can be interoperable,
we should say it correctly (iff).


Edits to 17-007
---------------

[330:21+] In 15.6.2.1 Procedures defined by subprograms / General,
after the syntax rule R1528 for <proc-language-binding-spec> insert a
new paragraph:

      "A <proc-language-binding-spec> specifies that a procedure
       interface is interoperable (18.3.7)."


[330:31-34] In 15.6.2.1 Procedures defined by subprograms / General,
delete C1555 and replace C1556 with:

   C1556 If <proc-language-binding-spec> is specified for a procedure, the
         <ALLOCATABLE> or <POINTER> attribute shall not be specified for a
         <default-initialized> <dummy argument>."


[493:4] In 18.3.7 Interoperability of procedures and procedure
interfaces, paragraph 1, replace "interoperable if it has" with
"interoperable if and only if it has".
