---------------------------------

{Bill I7}: At [15:15-16] In the case of an optional OLD argument to an
atomic subroutine, the code generated is different depending on
whether OLD is present or not. This is a side effect of economizing on
subroutine names by using the same name for two operations. If the
user writes an OLD argument into the call, it will almost always be
the case that it will be referenced soon after the call. We need to
say that an optional OLD argument that appears shall be present.
Allowing the not-present actual corresponding to an optional argument
is of very little value in this case and allowing it incurs both a
readability and performance penalty. Edits are provided.

{Steve 2}: In ATOMIC_ADD change "ATOM becomes defined with the value
of ATOM+VALUE" to "ATOM becomes defined with the value of ATOM +
INT(VALUE,ATOMIC_INT_KIND)".  The change makes the style more like the
descriptions of the other atomics. And it avoids the problem of VALUE
being too large magnitude to be represented by an integer of KIND
ATOMIC_INT_KND, which would be problematic to implement. Edit included
below.

{Nick 23}: The atomic subroutines must specify that their ATOM
argument is a coarray, in the same way as ATOMIC_DEFINE and
ATOMIC_REF.  Edits are provided for each new Atomic subroutine.

{Van 18, 19, 19a, 20, 21}: In the description of the OLD arguments to
atomics, "scalar of the same type as ATOM" -> "scalar and of type
integer with the same kind as ATOM".  Edits are provided for each
affected atomic subroutine.

{Van 22}: At [16:18] Delete "to have its".

Misc additional minor edits are also included, labeled {Van mxx}.

{Van 17}: At [15:11-13] First two sentences are redundant.  Delete the
first one.
Response: These sentences were directly copied from F2008/10-007r1 at
[315:12-14] and should not be edited here.

{Dan 7}: For atomic_and,or,xor, why not type logical?
Response: Typically atomic hardware supports bitwise operations for
these cases.  Whether that will work for LOGICAL depends on the
internal representation of LOGICAL values. It might work, but
effectively imposes a limitation on the implementation.

{Van 23}: At [16:35] It's hard to justify "swap" in the description of
a subroutine in which only one argument has INTENT(INOUT).  Swap what
with what?
Response: The term "compare and swap" is common in the computer
science lexicon. Using another description would be needlessly
confusing. The second object involved in the swap is split into two
parts, NEW on the way in and OLD on the way out.  This allows NEW to
be a constant, which is a common usage case. Note that the "and swap"
part is conditional depending on the outcome of the compare.
