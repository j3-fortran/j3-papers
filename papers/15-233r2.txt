Edits:

[52:4] 4.2 Type parameters, p2, delete entire paragraph.
{Useless general waffle entirely redundant as it is properly
 specified in p4.}

[57:0+6-8] 4.4.3.2 Real type, NOTE 4.7,
           Change ", and ... and X = -0.0." to ".".
{Arithmetic IF has been deleted.}

[60:25] 4.4.4.2 Character type specifier, p5,
        bullet "If used to declare a dummy argument",
        "assumes the length of the" -> "assumes its length from its",
{Make wording more consistent with e.g. 60:28.}
[60:28] bullet "If used in the <type-spec> of an ALLOCATE",
        "assumes its length from the" -> "assumes its length from its".
{Clarify each <allocate-object> assumes the length from its effective
 argument.}

[66-67:1-] 4.5.2.4 Determination of derived types, NOTE 4.21,
           "<type-name>s of the respective <derived-type-stmt>s"
           ->"type names in the respective derived type definitions".
{An evil conspiracy of LaTeX macros and page breaking has broken this
 note; rewording to use normal terms instead of hyperlinked syntax terms
 should improve that.  Hopefully.}

[74:3] 4.5.4.7 Component order, p1,
       "(where ... used)" -> "where ... used".
{The meaning is supposed to be "structure constructors where component
 keywords are not used", it is not supposed to be a parenthetical remark.}

[75:0+2] 4.5.4.8 Component accessibility, NOTE 4.40
         "a type with private" -> "a public type with private",
[75:0+3] "TYPE POINT" -> "TYPE,PUBLIC :: POINT",
[75:0+7] "is accessible in any scoping unit accessing the module via a USE
         statement"
         ->"can be accessed by use association",
[75:0+8] ", and within" -> "and".
{Simplify explanation and remove overstatements.}

Rejected edits.

[53:33] Text is correct as is, adding "if any" does not clarify.
        (We have had zero-sized arrays for a long time now.)

[54:12] No, TYPE(*) cannot appear as the selector in SELECT TYPE.
