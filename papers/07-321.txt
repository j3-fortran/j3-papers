F03/0097 Blanks as separators in NAMELIST input

  Dick Hendrickson's YES comment on F03/0097:

    I agree with Bill Long's comment

  Bill Long's YES comment for F03/0097:

    (a) Fix a typo in question 1.  In the following question change
         the first "in" to "it".

          1)  Was in intended that blanks be allowed as separators in
              Namelist Input?

    (b) Wording changes in the questions would clarify the issue.

         - At the beginning of the following paragraph, add "Page
           243:12 says that the name-value subsequences are separated
           by value separators."

             Page 243:5 says that namelist value separators are the
             same as list directed value separators.

         - At the beginning of question 2, add "Page 245:29-30 says
           that a name-value subsequence is separated from the ! in a
           comment by a value separator."

             2)  Is there a similar problem with namelist comments as
                 in this fragment?

                   I = 3           !  this is a namelist comment

    (c) Rewrite the answer to put the main subject first.  Change the
        edit for [243:5] to put namelist first (as is the case in
        04-007), so that the full edit is:

         "A value separator for namelist formatting is a value
          separator for list-directed formatting (10.9), or one or
          more contiguous blanks between a nonblank value and the
          following object designator or "!" comment initiator."

    (d) As a separate, but related issue, the text at [243:7-13]
        details the form of namelist input, but does not make any
        mention of comments. Is this a omission? If so, could it be
        fixed as part of this interp?

  Stan Whitlock's YES comment on F03/0097:

    I agree with Bill's comment

  Conclusion on F03/0097:  Passed J3 letter ballot #14 with
                           Bill's changes (a), (b), and (c)

    As to Bill's comment (d), the new definition of "value separator"
    in the edit covers comments when applied to that term in
    [243:12] .  No change is needed.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

F03/0098 Does allocate with source= define subcomponents?

  Dick Hendrickson's YES comment on F03/0098:

    I agree with Bill Long and Jim Xia's comments

  Bill Long's YES comment for F03/0098:

    The answer is fine. In the following statement of the question,
    "allocate STATEMENT" should be "ALLOCATE statement".

      Bullet 11 on 422 says "Successful execution of an allocate
      STATEMENT ... causes the subcomponent to become undefined."

  Stan Whitlock's YES comment on F03/0098:

    I agree with Bill and Jim's comments

  Jim Xia's YES comment on F03/0098:

    The subclause numbers are wrong in edit 2 and 3:
      [421:27-28] 16.5.6, ... should be [421:27-28] 16.5.5, ...


      [421:28+] 16.5.6, ... should be [421:28+] 16.5.5, ...

 Conclusion on F03/0098:  Passed J3 letter ballot #14 with
                          Bill and Jim's changes

----------------------------------------------------------------------

F03/0099 Clause 16 does not account for volatile variable

  Dick Hendrickson's NO vote on F03/0099:

    We need to consider Van Snyder, Bill Long, and Jim Xia's comments

  Bill Long's YES comment for F03/0099:

    1) Should the edit at [113:21+] really be at [113:12+]?  It would
       make sense to put the special cases related to attributes
       together.

    2) The edit at [415:27] in in the section about pointer
       association status, not about the definition status of the
       pointer's target. That seems to be covered by the later edits.
       Incorporating Van's proposed changes, I'd propose:

        "The association status of a pointer object with the VOLATILE
         attribute may be changed by means not specified by the
         program. In addition, its array bounds or deferred type
         parameters may change.  If it is polymorphic, its dynamic
         type may change."

  Van Snyder's NO vote on F03/0099:

    An object doesn't have to be polymorphic in order to have
    changeable deferred length type parameters.  The edit for [415:27]
    ought to be

      [415:27]  Add a new paragraph at the end of 16.4.2.1.4

        "When a pointer object with the VOLATILE attribute is changed
         by a means not specified by the program it may become defined
         or undefined.  In addition, its array bounds, association
         status and deferred type parameters may change.  If it is
         polymorphic, its dynamic type may change."

  Stan Whitlock's NO vote on F03/0099:

    No - Van, Bill, and Jim all make good points - this needs more work

  Jim Xia's NO vote on F03/0099:

    I agree partially with Van's No vote.  The type parameter of a non-
    polymorphic entity that can be changed by means other than the
    program itself must be deferred. In addition, the deferred type
    parameter does not require the entity to be polymorphic.

    In the case of a polymorphic entity with VOLATILE, however, there
    is a possibility that the dynamic type of the entity may require
    type parameters in addition to those specified in the type
    declaration itself.  Any of these additional type parameters may
    change due to either change of the dynamic type or change in
    entity's association status.  This is not covered in Van's edit.

    So I suggest an edit as follows (it may need wordsmithery)

      [415:27]  Add a new paragraph at the end of 16.4.2.1.4

       "When a pointer object with the VOLATILE attribute is changed
        by a means not specified by the program it may become defined
        or undefined.  In addition, its array bounds, association
        status and deferred type parameters may change.  If it is
        polymorphic, its dynamic type and any additional type
        parameters not specified in its declaration may also change."

 Conclusion on F03/0099:  Failed J3 letter ballot #14 - the above
                          comments need to be resolved

F03/0100 Error in field width for special cases of signed INFINITY
         output

  Dick Hendrickson's YES comment on F03/0100:

    I agree with Bill Long's comment

  Bill Long's YES comment for F03/0100:

    The proposed edit is unclear as to what the "otherwise" covers. A
    possible rewrite:

      [228:36-37] Replace the sentence beginning 'If <w> is less
      than 3..." with

       "If <w> is less than 3 + <s>, the field is filled with
        asterisks;  otherwise, if <w> is less than 8 + <s>, the field
        contains the sign, if present, followed by 'Inf'. The value of
        <s> is 1 if a sign is produced and 0 otherwise."

  Stan Whitlock's NO vote on F03/0100:

    No - I agree with Bill that the edit needs fixing but I don't like
    his proposal - this needs more work

  Conclusion on F03/0100:  Failed J3 letter ballot #14 - the edit
                           needs to be reworded

----------------------------------------------------------------------

F03/0101 Is UDDTIO output suitable for namelist and list-directed
         input

  Dick Hendrickson's NO vote on F03/00101:

    I agree with Bill Long's comment

  Bill Long's NO comment for F03/0101:

    (a) Typos in the question.  In this sentence of the question:

          Is it intended that output produced by used defined derived
          type routines conform to these rules?

        replace "used defined" with "user-defined".

    (b) Typos/editing problems in the answer.  In the ANSWER, replace
        "un-delimited" with "undelimited", and "nor" with "or".

    (c) Typos in the edits.  In each edit, replace "used-defined" with
        "user-defined".

    (d) Defects in the edits.  The two edits are each self-contradictory.
        The first says that the form of output for list-directed output
        need not be compatible with the form of list-directed output.
        (In both cases, for the type in question, accomplished with a
        UDDTIO routine.)  Similarly for the second edit.

        The paragraph being edited starts by saying that the form of
        output is that required for input with exceptions. This is just
        one of the exceptions. In particular, the UDDTIO read_formatted
        routine, if one is provided, need not be able to correctly process
        the output generated by the write_formatted routine for the same
        type. If there is no read_formatted routine then the default
        formatted input processing for the type need not be compatible
        with the output generated by the write_formatted routine. It is up
        to the programmer to get this right if needed. If that's what was
        meant here, then both edits could be fixed by deleting the "or
        output" at the end of each edit.

        Or do we mean to say that the form of the output from a UDDTIO
        routine may vary from one variable to the next, for example, by
        generating field widths based on calls to a random number
        generator?  If this is what was intended, then more explanation is
        needed.

        Or was the intention to say that the form of output may differ
        between the cases where there is a UDDTIO routine and not? If this
        is what was intended, then changing "or output" to "or output that
        would have occurred if the type did not specify user-defined
        derived type formatted output".

        In any case, some repair to the edit is needed.

  Van Snyder's YES comment on F03/0101:

    In the last line of the answer, "nor" should be "or".

  Stan Whitlock's NO vote on F03/0101:

    No - I agree with Bill's comment

  Jim Xia's YES comment on F03/0101:

    I agree with Bill's comments (a), (b) and (c)

Conclusion on F03/0101:  Passed J3 letter ballot #14 with Bill's
                         comments (a), (b), and (c) plus the
                         conclusion in (d) paragraph 2: "both
                         edits could be fixed by deleting the "or
                         output" at the end of each edit

NUMBER: F03/0092
TITLE:  Procedure characteristics and unlimited polymorphic
KEYWORDS: Procedure, unlimited polymorphic
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Consider

    abstract interface
        function foo (x)
            class(*) x
            class(*), pointer :: foo
        end function
    end interface

    procedure (foo), pointer :: proc_ptr
    procedure (foo), target  :: proc_tgt

    proc_ptr => proc_tgt

According to the rules of procedure pointer assignment at [144:39-41],
proc_ptr and proc_tgt are required to have the same interface
characteristics.  However because an unlimited polymorphic entity is not
considered to have a declared type, the rules for characteristics of
dummy data objects [256:26-32] and characteristics of function
results [257:2-8] are not applicable. In addition, rules at [145:5-6]
require that proc_ptr and proc_tgt have the same function return type.
This also does not apply to unlimited polymorphic data.

Is the example intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

Yes, the example was intended to be standard-conforming.
An edit is provided to clarify this.

The characteristics however are adequately defined.  FOO, and thus
both PROC_PTR and PROC_TGT have no type, but are polymorphic; this
precisely characterises an unlimited polymorphic entity.  Only the
requirement of type matching in 7.4.2.2 is incorrect.

EDITS to 04-007:

[145:5] After "the same type"
        insert " or both be unlimited polymorphic".

TITLE:  Allocatable array on intrinsic assignment with scalar expr
KEYWORDS: allocatable array, intrinsic assignment
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Consider

    CHARACTER(:), ALLOCATABLE :: str(:)
    ALLOCATE (CHARACTER(1) :: str(0:9))
    str = 'reallocate?'

According to the third paragraph of 7.4.1.3, the variable STR should
be deallocated on this assignment because it has a deferred length
type parameter different from the <expr> ('reallocate?'); it should
then be allocated with its length type parameter the same as that of
the <expr> and with the shape and bounds of <expr>.  But the STR
cannot be allocated with the shape and bounds of the <expr> since it
is a scalar.

The standard, however, provides a possible interpretation for the
shape of <expr> two paragraphs later where it says
  "If <expr> is a scalar and <variable> is an array, the <expr> is
   treated as if it were an array of the same shape as <variable>
   with every element of the array equal to the scalar value of
   <expr>."

Q(1). Should the variable STR be reallocated in this case?

Q(2). If so, what are the values of its length type parameter, shape
      and bounds?

ANSWER:

(1) Yes, STR should be reallocated - that is the purpose of the
    combination of ALLOCATABLE and deferred type parameters.  If
    the user does not wish for automatic reallocation he can use
    "str(:) = 'do not reallocate'" instead.

(2) The length parameter of str after the assignment is 11 (the value
    returned by LEN('reallocate?')).  The shape and bounds should be
    unchanged.  An edit is provided to clarify this.

Note that the standard does not forbid, but does not specify semantics
for,

  str = 'oops'

when STR is an unallocated array with a deferred length parameter.
An edit is supplied to make it clear that this is not allowed.

Note also that this applies to parameterized derived types with
deferred type parameters.

EDITS:

[139:22-] Insert new sentence at beginning of paragraph
  "If <variable> is an unallocated allocatable array, <expr> shall
   be an array of the same rank as <variable>."

[139:25] Change "corresponding type parameters of <expr>,"
         to "corresponding type parameter of <expr>."

[139:25] Before ", with the shape of <expr>"
         Insert ". If <variable> is an array and <expr> is scalar it is
                 allocated with the same bounds as before, otherwise
                 it is allocated".

TITLE: Blanks as separators in NAMELIST input
KEYWORDS: Namelist input, blanks, separators
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

1)  Was it intended that blanks be allowed as separators in Namelist
    Input?

Consider a namelist input fragment:

              I = 3              J = 4

  Page 243:12 says that the name-value subsequences are separated by
  value separators.

  Page 243:5 says that namelist value separators are the same as
  list directed value separators.

  Page 239:7 says those value separators are "...blanks between
  values" and then defines what the values are.

  The "J" above isn't a value, so the blanks aren't separators and
  the fragment is illegal for namelist input

2)  Is there a similar problem with namelist comments as in this
    fragment?

              I = 3           !  this is a namelist comment

  Page 245:29-30 says that a name-value subsequence is separated
  from the ! in a comment by a value separator.

ANSWER:

1)  Yes, it was intended to allow blanks as separators for namelist
input.  Edits are supplied to correct the wording in the standard.

2)  Yes, there is a similar problem with comments.  The fragment is
intended to be legal.  The edits correct the error.

EDITS:

  "A value separator for namelist formatting is a value separator
   for list-directed formatting (10.9), or one or more contiguous
   blanks between a nonblank value and the following object

KEYWORDS: allocate, source, define
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Was it intended that an allocate with a source= clause define
subcomponents?

Bullet 11 on 422 says "Successful execution of an ALLOCATE statement
...causes the subcomponent to become undefined."

ANSWER:

An Allocate with a SOURCE= specifier was intended to define
subcomponents.

In fact, none of the lists in clause 16 account for a SOURCE=
specifier.  Edits are supplied to clarify this.

EDITS:

[113:21]  At the end of the last sentence in 6.3.1.1 insert
"unless they are defined by a SOURCE= specifier"

[421:27-28] 16.5.5, list item 19, modify by adding after
       "Allocation of an object", "except by an ALLOCATE statement
       with a SOURCE= specifier".

             object to become defined if the corresponding subobject
             of the SOURCE= expression is defined."

[422:41]  16.5.6, list item (11) insert "with no SOURCE= specifier" after

KEYWORDS:UDDTIO, list-directed I/O, namelist I/O
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

The first paragraph of 10.9.2 says that the form of the values
produced by list-directed output is the same as that required for
input.  It also says values are separated blanks or commas, etc.

The first paragraph of 10.10.2 has similar words for namelist output.
It also requires that the variable name be produced in upper case and
that the output consist of name-value pairs.

Is it intended that output produced by user-defined derived type
routines conform to these rules?

ANSWER:

No, it was not intended to constrain the user-derived type output
values.  There should be an exception similar to the one for adjacent
undelimited character values.  User derived type output fields do not
need to be readable by either namelist or list-directed input.

EDITS:

[241:5]  Add at the end of the paragraph
"The form of the output produced by a user-defined derived type output
routine invoked during list-directed output is specified by the
invoked routine.  It need not be compatible with list-directed input."

[246:4]  After "and logical values" add ", and output produced by
user-defined derived type output"

[246:7]  Add at the end of the paragraph
"The form of the output produced by a user-defined derived type output
routine invoked during namelist output is specified by the
invoked routine.  It need not be compatible with namelist input."
