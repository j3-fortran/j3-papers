Subject: UTI 009 - Allow <boz-literal-constant>s in output lists
Date: 2020-October-15

Discussion:

UTI 009 on page 271 of 20-007 states:

-------------------------------
Unresolved Technical Issue 009

Output of boz-literal-constant is not permitted at all.  That's
because such a list item is not of type integer, real, or complex, and
thus fails the rules in 13.7.2.4.
---------------------------------

The text at [270:4] says "The B, O, and Z edit descriptors can also be
used to specify the output of <boz-literal-constant>s.", which
contradicts the text at the beginning of 13.7.2.4 at [276:28-31]
which says:

"13.7.2.4 B, O, and Z editing 

The Bw, Bw.m, Ow, Ow.m, Zw, and Zw.m edit descriptors indicate that
the field to be edited occupies w positions, except when w is
zero. When w is zero, the processor selects the field width. On input,
w shall not be zero. The corresponding input/output list item shall be
of type integer, real, or complex."

Indeed, the final sentence does not include <boz-literal-constant>s
which is a clear omission.  An edit is provided to correct this. The
edit takes into account that a literal constant cannot appear as an
input list item and BOZ is not a "type".


Edits to 20-007
----------------

[276:31] in 13.7.2.4 B, O, and Z editing, replace the last sentence at
the end of the first paragraph that currently reads:

"The corresponding input/output list item shall be of type integer,
real, or complex."

with two sentences:

"For output, the corresponding list item shall be a
<boz-literal-constant> or of type integer, real, or complex. For
input, the corresponding list item shall be of type integer, real, or
complex."
