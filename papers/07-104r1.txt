Subject:    Editorial, Clause 15 ignores c_sizeof
References: J3/07-007

In 15.2.3, the paragraph beginning at 468:24 contains several
sentences which don't really say anything about the old F2003
interoperability functions.  But, there is no sentence which
specifically doesn't say anything about c_sizeof.

[469:4] Insert:
"The result of the C_SIZEOF function is the same as applying the
C sizeof operator."
