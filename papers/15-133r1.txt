NUMBER: F08/0130
TITLE: Does coarray allocation sync even with stopped images?
KEYWORDS: ALLOCATE, DEALLOCATE, coarray, synchronization, stopped
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Example 1: Consider the trivial program

  Program m206c7e1
    Use Iso_Fortran_Env
    Implicit None
    Real,Allocatable :: x(:)[:]
    Integer :: me[*],i
    Integer stat
    me = This_Image()
    If (Num_Images()<3) Error Stop 'Need at least 3 images'
    If (me==1) Then
      Stop 'Image 1 is now stopping'
    End If
    Allocate(x(100)[*],Stat=stat)
    !
    If (me==2) Print *,'Arrived'                !***A
    !
    If (stat==0) Error Stop 'INCONCEIVABLE'
    If (stat/=Stat_Stopped_Image) Error Stop 'Bad STAT'
    !
    Do i=1,Num_Images()
      If (me[i]/=i) Error Stop 'me not right?'  !***B
    End Do
  End Program

Q1. On images other than image 1, does execution ever reach the
    statement with comment "!***A"?

    6.7.1.2 Execution of an ALLOCATE statement, p4 says
      "When an ALLOCATE statement is executed for which an
       allocate-object is a coarray, there is an implicit
       synchronization of all images.  On each image, execution of the
       segment (8.5.2) following the statement is delayed until all
       other images have executed the same statement the same number
       of times."

    The second sentence seems to say that execution on images>1 is
    delayed forever, since image 1 will never execute that ALLOCATE
    statement.

Example 2: Consider the program

  Program m206c7e2
    Use Iso_Fortran_Env
    Implicit None
    Real(real32),Allocatable :: x(:,:,:,:)[:],y(:,:,:,:)
    Integer :: me[*],i
    Integer stat
    me = This_Image()
    If (Num_Images()<3) Error Stop 'Need at least 3 images'
    If (me==1) Then
      Allocate(y(1000,1000,1000,1000))                !***C
    End If
    Allocate(x(1000,1000,1000,1000)[*],Stat=stat)     !***D
    !
    If (me==1 .And. stat==0) Error Stop 'Inconceivable!'
    !
    If (stat==0) Print *, 'ALLOCATE ok on image', me  !***E
    !
    Do i=1,Num_Images()
      If (me[i]/=i) Error Stop 'me not right?'        !***F
    End Do
  End Program

For purposes of discussion, let us assume that each image has 6
Terabytes of memory available to it for dynamic allocation.

The ALLOCATE statement commented "!***C" will allocate 4 terabytes of
memory on image 1.  Execution of the ALLOCATE statement commented
"!***D" will attempt to allocate 4 terabytes on each image; this will
fail on image 1 as there is insufficient memory available, but could
succeed on other images.

Q2. Is the success of an ALLOCATE statement the same on every image,
    or may it fail on some images and succeed on others?  That is,
    might the statement commented "!***E" execute the PRINT on some
    images (but not all).

Q2 continuation:
    If the answer is that the ALLOCATE must either succeed or fail on
    all images, can the STAT= value differ by image (for example,
    might a processor return a different STAT= code for "no memory on
    this image" and "no memory on some other image").

Example 3: Consider the program

  Program m206c7e3
    Use Iso_Fortran_Env
    Implicit None
    Real,Allocatable :: x(:)[:]
    Integer :: me[*],i
    Integer stat
    me = This_Image()
    If (Num_Images()<3) Error Stop 'Need at least 3 images'
    If (me==1) Then
      Call do_something_that_takes_a_very_long_time
    End If
    Allocate(x(100)[*],Stat=stat)               !***G
    !
    If (stat==0) Error Stop 'INCONCEIVABLE'
    !
    Do i=1,Num_Images()
      If (me[i]/=i) Error Stop 'me not right?'  !***H
    End Do
  End Program

Let us imagine that the processor operates some form of "timeout"
mechanism, for example, if an image fails to reach a synchronization
point within an hour of the first image reaching that statement, an
error is returned.  (If the slow image subsequently reaches that
statement, one might conjecture that it will also get an error, but
probably STAT_YOU_ARE_TOO_SLOW rather than STAT_TIMEOUT).

In the example above, let us assume that the ALLOCATE statement
commented "!***G" fails, e.g. with a timeout error as we imagined above.

Q3. After resolution of question 1, which images are synchronized
    after execution of an ALLOCATE statement that fails?  That is,
    is execution of the statements commented "!***B" (in Q1), "!***F"
    (in Q2) and "!***H" (above) permitted, or are they impermissible
    references to variables in unordered segments?

    In the case of "!***B", one might conjecture that all the
    non-stopped images are synchronized.

    In the case of "!***F" the text of the standard appears to require
    that image 1 has to wait for all the other images, but it might
    equally be conjectured that that is a mistake and that since it
    knows straightaway that it cannot satisfy the memory allocation it
    should be allowed to return straightaway without synchronizing,
    i.e. the "!***F" is not allowed.

    In the case of "!***H", image 1 has still not even reached the
    ALLOCATE statement (after an hour of the others waiting), so it
    would seem that it is impossible for it to have synchronized as
    required by the standard, and therefore that (for i==1 at least)
    the execution of "!***H" is not allowed.

Q4. When allocation of a coarray is involved, and an error occurs
    (e.g. as in the examples above, plus other cases), under what
    situations does the coarray in question become allocated?

    In particular, can a coarray be allocated on some images but not
    others?  If the answer is that the coarray never becomes
    allocated, that means that in the case of a stopped image, the
    remaining images cannot allocate any coarray.

Q5. Do the answers to Q1-Q4 also apply to DEALLOCATE statements?

ANSWER:

A1. In the case of stopped images, the requirement in 6.7.1.2 was only
    intended to apply to the non-stopped images.  An edit is provided
    to correct this mistake.

A2. Allocation of a coarray was intended only to succeed if it
    succeeds on all images.  An edit is provided to add this missing
    requirement.
(A2 continuation)
    There was not intended to be any requirement that a nonzero STAT=
    value be the same on each image.  No edit is provided to add such
    a requirement.

A3. After execution of an ALLOCATE statement that returns an error
    other than STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE, there was not intended to be any
    requirement for synchronization.  An edit is provided to correct
    this mistake.

A4. The coarray can become allocated on an image if and only if it can
    become allocated on all other images.  An edit is provided to add
    this requirement.  The consequence in the case of a stopped image
    is indeed that no image can subsequently change the allocation
    status of any coarray.

A5. Yes, the answers also apply to DEALLOCATE statements.
    Corresponding edits are supplied.

EDITS:

[128:16-17] 6.7.1.2 Execution of an ALLOCATE statement, p4,
  Change "On each image"
  to     "If no error condition apart from STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE occurs,"
  Change "all other images"
  to     "all non-stopped images",
{A1,A3: Synchronization only applies to successful allocations and to
         allocations that fail only due to STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE.}
  Append a sentence requiring allocation success consistency for
  coarrays, making the whole paragraph read:
    "When an ALLOCATE statement is executed for which an
     <allocate-object> is a coarray, there is an implicit
     synchronization of all images.  If no error condition apart from
     STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE occurs, execution of the segment following the
     statement is delayed until all non-stopped images have executed
     the same statement the same number of times.  The coarray shall
     not become allocated on an image unless it is successfully
     allocated on all images."
{A2,A4: Last sentence is the consistency requirement.}

[131:17-18] 6.7.3.2 Deallocation of allocatable variables, p11,
  Change "On each image"
  to     "If no error condition apart from STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE occurs,"
  Change "all other images"
  to     "all non-stopped images",
  Append a sentence requiring deallocation consistency, making the
  whole paragraph read:
    "When a DEALLOCATE statement is executed for which an
     <allocate-object> is a coarray, there is an implicit
     synchronization of all images.  If no error condition occurs,
     execution of the segment (8.5.2) following the statement is
     delayed until all non-stopped images have executed the same
     statement the same number of times.  If the coarray is a dummy
     argument, its ultimate argument (12.5.2.3) shall be the same
     coarray on every image.  The coarray shall not become deallocated
     on an image unless it is successfully deallocated on all images."
