Subject: Control of leading zero in formatted numeric output
Date: 2019-February-14

Reference: 18-007r1, 18-268, 18-120r3, 18-010

Introduction
------------

At meeting 215, J3 agreed to add "leading zero format control" to its
work list for Fortran 202x. Please see 18-268 from meeting 217 for
additional background.

Requirements
------------

- Add control edit descriptors, analogous to the SS, SP and S edit
  descriptors, allowing the programmer to specify whether a leading
  zero is to appear in output for the F, E, D and G formats in the
  cases where it is currently optional.

  The requirement of the leading zero when otherwise no digits would
  appear is to remain. As with the existing S control descriptor,
  one of the new descriptors selects the implementation-defined
  behavior, which remains the default.

- Continuing the analogy with SS, SP and S, and the SIGN= OPEN/INQUIRE
  specifier, add a new specifier to OPEN and INQUIRE to allow
  specification or inquiry of the current mode. Like SIGN=, this
  is to be a "changeable mode" (12.5.2p1). List-directed and namelist-
  directed output are to use the current "leading zero" mode.

Specification
-------------

1. Add the following control edit descriptors: LZS, LZP, LZ.

The LZS, LZP, and LZ edit descriptors temporarily change (12.5.2) the
leading zero mode for the connection. The edit descriptors LZS, LZP,
and LZ set the leading zero mode corresponding to the LEADING_ZERO=
specifier values SUPPRESS, PRINT, and PROCESSOR_DEFINED, respectively.

The leading zero mode controls optional leading zero characters in numeric
output fields. When the leading zero mode is PRINT, the processor shall
produce a leading zero in any position that normally contains an optional
leading zero. When the leading zero mode is SUPPRESS, the processor shall
not produce a leading zero in such positions. When the leading zero mode
is PROCESSOR_DEFINED, the processor has the option of producing a leading
zero or not in such positions, subject to 13.7.2(5) [rule about filling
field with asterisks and optional characters].

The LZS, LZP, and LZ edit descriptors affect only F and E editing during
the execution of an output statement. The LZS, LZP, and LZ edit
descriptors have no effect during the execution of an input statement.

2. Add the data transfer statement specifier LEADING_ZERO

The specifier value shall evaluate to PRINT, SUPPRESS, or
PROCESSOR_DEFINED. The LEADING_ZERO= specifier temporarily changes
(12.5.2) the leading zero mode for the connection. If the specifier
is omitted, the mode is not changed.

3. Add the OPEN specifier LEADING_ZERO=.

The specifier value shall evaluate to one of PRINT, SUPPRESS, or
PROCESSOR_DEFINED. The LEADING_ZERO= specifier is permitted only for a
connection for formatted input/output. It specifies the leading zero mode
for this connection. It is a changeable mode (12.5.2). If this specifier
is omitted in an OPEN statement that initiates a connection, the default
value is PROCESSOR_DEFINED.

4. Add the INQUIRE specifier LEADING_ZERO to retrieve the leading zero
mode for a connected unit.

Straw Vote
----------

There are several plausible choices for the "P" keyword value. For SIGN=,
the word is PLUS which makes no sense here. What is the committee's
preference? Choosing a different initial letter may hinder understanding
of the control edit descriptors.

- PRESENT
- PRINT
- PROVIDE
- PRODUCE (this is the word used in the normative text for SS/SP/S)
- something else

Edits to 18-007r1
-----------------

{add remark to Introduction in the bullet item for Input/Output}

[xiii] add:

"The LEADING_ZERO specifier in the OPEN and INQUIRE statements, and the
LZP, LZS and LZ control edit descriptors, provide control of optional
leading zeros during formatted output."

{add LEADING_ZERO to the OPEN statement]

[220:10+, 12.5.6.2, Syntax of the OPEN statement] add after IOSTAT=:

          " or LEADING_ZERO = scalar-default-char-expr "

[222:7+, 12.5.6.11+] add:

"12.5.6.11+ LEADING_ZERO= specifier in the OPEN statement

The scalar-default-char-expr shall evaluate to one of PRINT, SUPPRESS,
or PROCESSOR_DEFINED. The LEADING_ZERO= specifier is permitted only for a
connection for formatted input/output. It specifies the leading zero mode
(13.8.3+, 12.6.2.14) for this connection. It is a changeable mode
(12.5.2). If this specifier is omitted in an OPEN statement that
initiates a connection, the default value is PROCESSOR_DEFINED. "

{add LEADING_ZERO to data transfer statement control list}
[225:17+, 12.6.2.1p1, Control information list > Syntax)] add after
IOSTAT=:

          " or LEADING_ZERO = scalar-default-char-expr "

{Prohibit LEADING_ZERO= in a READ statement}
[225:28, 12.6.2.1p1]

In C1212, replace "A DELIM= or SIGN= specifier" with "A DELIM=,
LEADING_ZERO=, or SIGN= specifier"

{Require format or namelist if LEADING_ZERO= specified}
[226:18, 12.6.2.1p1]

In C1227, insert ", LEADING_ZERO=" after "BLANK="

{Specify limits on specifier value interpretation.}
[226:27, 12.6.2.1p4]

Insert ", LEADING_ZERO=" after "DELIM="

{Add description of specifier for data transfer statement}

[228:30+, 12.6.2.9+]

Insert a new subsection:

"12.6.2.9+ LEADING_ZERO= specifier in a data transfer statement

The scalar-default-char-expr shall evaluate to PRINT, SUPPRESS, or
PROCESSOR_DEFINED. The LEADING_ZERO= specifier temporarily changes
(12.5.2) the leading zero mode (13.8.3+, 12.5.6.11+) for the connection.
If the specifier is omitted, the mode is not changed. "

{Add LEADING_ZERO= to INQUIRE}

          " or LEADING_ZERO = scalar-default-char-expr "

after ID=, insert a new subsection:

"12.10.2.14+ LEADING_ZERO= specifier in the INQUIRE statement

The scalar-default-char-variable in the LEADING_ZERO= specifier is
assigned the value PRINT, SUPPRESS, or PROCESSOR_DEFINED, corresponding
to the leading zero mode in effect for a connection for formatted
input/output. If there is no connection, or if the connection is not
for formatted input/output, the scalar-default-char-variable is assigned
the value UNDEFINED."

{Add LZP, LZS, LZ edit descriptors}

{The editor is welcome to rearrange the order of specifiers if desired -
I am not able to discern the pattern of the current order.}

[258:27+, 13.3.2p2, Edit descriptors], after "or :" insert:

     " or leading-zero-edit-desc"

[259:0+, 13.3.2p3] before R1317 (sign-edit-desc) insert:

                               or LZ"

[259:14, 13.3.2p4]

In the list of edit descriptors, insert ", LZS, LZP, LZ"

[272:29+, 13.8.3+] After the subsection on colon editing, insert
the new subsection:

"13.8.3+ LZS, LZP and LZ editing

The LZS, LZP, and LZ edit descriptors temporarily change (12.5.2) the
leading zero mode (12.5.6.11+, 12.6.2.9+) for the connection. The edit
descriptors LZS, LZP, and LZ set the leading zero mode corresponding
to the LEADING_ZERO= specifier values SUPPRESS, PRINT, and
PROCESSOR_DEFINED, respectively.

The leading zero mode controls optional leading zero characters in numeric
output fields. When the leading zero mode is PRINT, the processor shall
produce a leading zero in any position that normally contains an optional
leading zero. When the leading zero mode is SUPPRESS, the processor shall
not produce a leading zero in such positions. When the leading zero mode
is PROCESSOR_DEFINED, the processor has the option of producing a leading
