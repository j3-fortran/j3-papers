NUMBER: F08/0104
TITLE: IEEE Inquiry Functions
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

All references are to Fortran 2008 10-007r1.

On comp.lang.fortran Francis Coudert asked
 The Fortran 2008 standard defines an inquiry function
 as an "intrinsic function, or function in an intrinsic
 module, whose result depends on the properties of one
 or more of its arguments instead of their values".
 10-007r1 section 1.3.89 [11:27-30]

 I wonder: by that definition, how can the
 IEEE_SUPPORT_HALTING(FLAG) function from the
 IEEE_EXCEPTIONS intrinsic module be an inquiry function?
 Its result depends on the value of FLAG, not its
 properties.

QUESTIONS:

Question 1.

Are the functions

 IEEE_support_flag
 IEEE_support_halting
 IEEE_support_rounding
 c_associated
 c_funloc
 c_loc

intended to be inquiry functions?

Question 2.

Are they consistent with the definition of inquiry
functions?

Question 3.

Are they allowed in Specification expressions?

Question 4.

Are they allowed in Constant expressions?

ANSWERS:

Answer 1.

No.  These intrinsic module functions

 IEEE_support_flag
 IEEE_support_halting
 IEEE_support_rounding
 c_associated
 c_funloc
 c_loc

are not inquiry functions because their results depend on their
arguments.  Edits are provided to correctly identify these functions
as transformational:

[18:35-37] section 1.3.146
transformational function
intrinsic function, or function in an intrinsic module, that
is neither elemental nor an inquiry function

Answer 2.

No.  Their current classification is inconsistent with the definition
of inquiry functions.

Answer 3.

They should be allowed in specification expressions.  Edits are
provided to correct this.

Answer 4.

They should be allowed in constant expressions.  Edits are
provided to correct this.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[150:28+] section 7.1.11 Specification expression, paragraph 2,
after bullet (10), insert a new bullet:

"(nn) a reference to a transformational function from the
intrinsic module IEEE_ARITHMETIC or IEEE_EXCEPTIONS (14) or
the intrinsic module ISO_C_BINDING (10), where each argument
is a restricted expression,"

[152:7-8] section 7.1.12 Constant expression, paragraph 1, replace
bullet (8):

"(8) a reference to the transformational function
IEEE_SELECTED_REAL_KIND from the intrinsic module
IEEE ARITHMETIC (14), where each argument is a constant
expression,"

with:

"(8) a reference to a transformational function from the
intrinsic module IEEE_ARITHMETIC or IEEE_EXCEPTIONS (14) or
the intrinsic module ISO_C_BINDING (10), where each argument
is a constant expression,"

[407-408:24+] section 14.10 Summary of the procedures, paragraph 3,
in Table 14.1, for procedure IEEE_SUPPORT_ROUNDING: change the
"Class" column entry from "I" to "T".

[408:1-] section 14.10 Summary of the procedures, paragraph 3,
in Table 14.2, for procedures IEEE_SUPPORT_FLAG and
IEEE_SUPPORT_HALTING: change the "Class" column entries from
"I" to "T".

paragraph 2:

"Inquiry function." -> "Transformational function."

[420:4] section 14.11.32 IEEE_SUPPORT_ROUNDING (ROUND_ VALUE) or
