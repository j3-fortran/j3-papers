  <FORTREQ>
  <NUMBER> 113
  <TITLE> Allow MERGE in constant expressions
  <KEYWORDS> MERGE, EXPRESSIONS, PARAMETER, CONSTANT
  <STATUS> Registered
  <TARGET>
  <SUBGROUP> 
  <VERSION> 1

  <REQUIREMENT>
  Modify the limitations on initialization expressions in some way that would
  allow the MERGE intrinsic to be used.

  <JUSTIFICATION>
  It is possible to work around the lack of MERGE, at least for integer
  relations, but the result tends to be obscure in the extreme.

  <ESTIMATED IMPACT>
  The document changes will likely be difficult to formulate, but well
  localized.

  The changes to existing processors should be similarly localized.
