                                                                  N1177
  
  To: X3J3 and WG5
  From: Richard Maine
  Subject: Edits made to X3J3/95-007R2
  
  The following changes have been made relative to X3J3/95-007r2 (N1166)
  to produce X3J3/96-007, also known as N1176, which is being circulated
  for final review prior to the DIS ballot on the f95.
  
  This list includes the changes formerly mentioned in paper
  X3J3/96-030, a fix for UK substantitive issue 5 as
  described in paper X3J3/96-050, plus fixes for a few other
  comments as described in paper X3J3/96-038.
  
  I have kept a copy that has change bars relative to X3J3/95-007r2,
  but the version for the DIS ballot has all the change bars cleared.
  
  ----------Misc fixes.
  
  [xiii:42]  Replace 'and' by 'simultaneously and then'.
  
  [xv:29] Delete comma.
  
  [xv:30] ", in order to decrease" -> "; this decreases"
  
  [14:17] "Statement function" -> "Statement function statement"
  
  [27:29-40]  Merge notes 3.8 and 3.9 as follows.  Start with
                      An "!" or ";" in character position 6
         as in note 3.8.  Then use the rest of the text from 3.9,
         following "position 6".  Change "another" to "an".
         Result replaces the old 3.8.  Delete the old 3.9
  
  [32:1] Delete "unsigned and".  No such term is defined.
  
  [33:21-22] Replace 'underflow occurs ... below' by 'the exact result of
        an operation is negative but rounding produces a zero'.
  
  [40:14] Delete hyphen from 'non-pointer'.
  
  [49:1] "type-spec" -> "<type-spec>"
  
  [51:27-31] Change the note to read
  
       An interface body may be specified for a dummy or external
       function whose result has a character length parameter value of *
       only if the function is not invoked.  This is because this
       characteristic has to be specified to be the same in the interface
       body as in the procedure definition, but in order to invoke such a
  May 14 07:44 1996  X3J3/96-099 (8 Pages) Page 2


       procedure, the calling routine is required to specify a length
       other than *.
  
  [54:2] "rank or the rank and shape are" -> "rank or shape is"
  
  [61:16] Change 'an' to 'a nonpointer'.
  
  [83:28] Change 'PROCES' to 'PROCESS'.
  
  [115:25] Add "is a scalar variable that" after "It".
           (because rank is an attribute).
  
  [115:26] Add ", and this type shall be integer type" after "FORALL" to
           be similar to comparable sentences at 280:41 and 280:45.
  
  [115:47] Capitalize the first word and add ',' at the end.
  [115:48] Capitalize the first word and add ', and' at the end.
  [116:1] Capitalize the first word and add '.' at the end.
  
  [119:16] Replace '<index-name> variables' by '<forall-header> expressions'. 
  
  [129:6] Add period at end of line in constraint after R834.
  
  [199:5] "shall" -> "shall not" in 4th constraint after R1215
  
  [212:5-8] Capitalize the first word of each item.
  
  [245:31] "is absent or present with the value..."
           -> "is absent or has the value..."
           The original wording invited strange misreadings (which could
           alternatively be fixed by adding "is" before "present").  This
           fix also repairs a bad line break.
  
  [253:31] 13.14.67 heading.  MAXLOC -> MAXVAL
  
  [256:19 13.14.72 heading.  MAXLOC -> MINVAL
  
  [260:27] 13.14.83 heading.  MAXLOC -> PRODUCT
  
  [266:37-40] Replace all 4 lines by
  
    Case (iv): If B is of type real and is zero, then
           (a) If the processor cannot distinguish between positive and
               negative real zero, the value of the result is |A|.
           (a) If B is positive real zero, the value of the result is |A|.
           (b) If B is negative real zero, the value of the result is -|A|.
  
  [268:37] 13.14.105 heading.  MAXLOC -> SUM
  
  [273:30] "present with" -> "has"
  May 14 07:44 1996  X3J3/96-099 (8 Pages) Page 3


  
  [280:41] "Its only attributes are" -> "It is a scalar variable that has".
  
  [280:43] Add "; it has no other attributes" before the period.
  
  [280:45] "Its only attributes are" -> "It is a scalar variable that has".
  
  [281:2] Add "; it has no other attributes" before the period.
  
  [293:30] Delete hyphen from 'non-pointer'.
  
  [305:30] Replace R504 by R512.
  [305:31] Replace (10) by (11).
  
  [305:45] "in" -> "In"
  
  [310:22] "compoents" -> "components"
  
  [316:12] "i" -> "I"
  
  --------------Resolution of UK substantitive item 5.
  Most of this is from paper X3J3/96-050, except for the deletion of
  Note 12.36, which is clearly needed because it directly referred
  to the deleted sentence above it.  I also consistently used :: syntax
  throuought the added example, and I added "s" to "expression".
  
  [214:4+] Add the following new constraint:
  
    Constraint: A dummy argument, or a subobject thereof, shall not appear
                in a <specification-expr> except as the argument to one of
                the intrinsic functions BIT_SIZE, KIND, LEN, or the numeric
                inquiry functions (13.11.8).
  
  [214:9+] Add a new note as follows:
  
    The restriction on dummy arguments in specification expressions is
    imposed primarily to facilitate optimization.  An example of usage
    that is not permitted is
  
         ELEMENTAL REAL FUNCTION F (A)
            REAL :: A
            INTEGER :: N
            REAL :: WORK_ARRAY (N)  ! Invalid
            ...
         END FUNCTION F
  
    An example of usage that is permitted is
  
         ELEMENTAL REAL FUNCTION F (A)
            REAL :: A
  May 14 07:44 1996  X3J3/96-099 (8 Pages) Page 4


            REAL (SELECTED_REAL_KIND (PRECISION (A)*2)) :: WORK
            ...
         END FUNCTION F
  
  [214:17-18] Delete sentence "For...expression."
  
  [214:19-20] Delete note 12.36
  
  [214:35-36] Delete sentence "For...expression."
  
  [214:40-215:9] Delete note 12.38
  
  --------------Some global items.
  
  Index.  Make font size for index entries 10 pt like the rest of the
      document instead of 12 pt.
  
  Change font for "FORTRAN 66" and "FORTRAN 77" to be consistently large "F"
      with "ORTRAN" in small capitals as in section 1.5.2 on pp 3-4.
      Changes are needed in the following lines:
  
      FORTRAN 66: 303:16, 303:20, 303:25, 303:27, 307:15
  
      FORTRAN 77: Contents at 1.5.2, 6:20, 6:24, 303:9, 303:13, 303:16, 303:20,
                  303:21, 303:24, 307:15, index at "compatibility", index at 
                  "FORTRAN 77 compatibility".
  
      (The heading for section 1.5.2 is ok on page 3.  However, my attempts
      to get the font size change into the table of contents entry for this
      section on pg i failed.  The index entries were also tricky, but they
      worked).

  interp 27
  
       1. In section 13.14.13, [232:19] in the description of the
          TARGET dummy argument add
            ". It shall have the same type, type parameters, and rank
                as POINTER"
          following
             "shall be a pointer or target"
  
       2.  Section 13.14.13, replace Case (ii) [232:25-27] and Case (iii)
           [232:28-30] with
           (Editor's note: I added commas after "otherwise" and "If POINTER
           is disassociated".  Also deleted "the" before "POINTER").

             sequences and they occupy the same storage units.
             Otherwise, the result is false.
             If either POINTER or TARGET is disassociated, the result
             is false.
  
           Case (v):   If TARGET is present and is an array pointer, the result
             is true if the target associated with POINTER and the
             target associated with TARGET have the same shape, are
             neither of size zero nor arrays whose elements are zero-sized
             storage sequences, and occupy the same storage units in
             array element order.  Otherwise, the result is false.
             If either POINTER or TARGET is disassociated, the result
             is false. "

          with the TARGET attribute, whether any pointers associated
          with the original actual argument become associated with the
          dummy argument with the TARGET attribute is processor

       3. In section 12.4.1.2, 8th paragraph, [201:1]
          Change 'is either scalar or is an assumed-shape array'
              to 'is either a scalar or an assumed-shape array'

       (As mentioned in email, the following text reflects some editorial
       changes from the exact text of the interpretation).
  
       1. [262:15+] In Section 13.14.86, before "Examples", insert the
          following paragraph:
  
           "The pseudorandom number generator used by RANDOM_NUMBER
            maintains a seed that is updated during the execution of
            RANDOM_NUMBER and that may be specified or returned by
            RANDOM_SEED.  Computation of the seed from argument PUT
            is performed in a processor-dependent manner.
            The value returned by GET need not be the same as the value
            specified by PUT in an immediately preceding reference to
            RANDOM_SEED.  For example, following execution of the
            statements
  
                 CALL RANDOM_SEED(PUT=SEED1)
                 CALL RANDOM_SEED(GET=SEED2)
  
            SEED2 need not equal SEED1.  When the values differ, the use
            of either value as the PUT argument in a subsequent call to
            RANDOM_SEED shall result in the same sequence of pseudorandom
            numbers being generated.  For example, after execution of
            the statements
  
                 CALL RANDOM_SEED(PUT=SEED1)
                 CALL RANDOM_SEED(GET=SEED2)
                 CALL RANDOM_NUMBER(X1)

  ----------- Final adjustments
  
  After all the above edits were done, some adjustments around tables and
  notes (which are implemented as Frame tables) were made to improve page
  breaks.  The automatic page breaking doesn't deal well with tables, so
  they often need to be hand-tuned.  None of these adjustments involved
  any changes to text.
  
  I ran a script to edit the Frame Postscript prolog so that the
  Postscript files should print without change on US letter and A4
  paper.
