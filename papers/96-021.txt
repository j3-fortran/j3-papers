Subject: 006 post-meeting 135 letter ballot

This is the 006 post-meeting 135 letter ballot. The ballot looks
a little different from other 006 post-meeting ballots as it
includes votes for edits being applied to Fortran 95.

Some of the 006 items listed below include edits to the Fortran 90
standard. If these 006 items are approved then corresponding edits
to Fortran 95 may be needed to keep the two standards synchronized.
Thus this ballot includes votes on the proposed Fortran 95 edits. The
proposed edits use page/line numbers from the CD version of Fortran 95
(95-007r1).

If you decide to vote No on a defect item that contains an edit, please
indicate in your comment whether you approve of the edit for Fortran 90.
(ie your NO vote is based on the text in the answer/discussion not
on the edit). Approving the edit will mean that the edit can be
included in corrigendum 3, even though work is still needed on the
text of the defect item.

This ballot is being conducted by email. No hardcopy will be mailed.
Please respond by e-mail. If you are unable to respond by e-mail please
contact me (Janice Shepherd (1-914-784-6313)).

Please let me know if you have any concerns about the ballot.
The ballot will end at midnight (eastern time) Jan 2nd. This is
longer than 30 days to give time for holidays/vacations.

The text of the defect items and the F95 edits were sent out
separately. Let me know if you did not receive the items.

Please do NOT return the text of the defect items when voting.

If you want to make a comment about an interpretation (you must make a comment
if you are voting No) please put the comment in the following format:

number  vote  lastname  Comment text ....
                        more comment ....
eg.
0        Y    Bleikamp  I really like these edits!

This format makes it easier for me to sort the comments by
interpretation number.

As I won't be sorting the comments on the F95 edits, I'm not
recommending a specific style for them.

You do not have to use the ballot form listed below to indicate your vote.
Sending me a note indicating "I vote yes without comments on all items
except for the following ..." is an acceptable form of voting. Other forms
of voting are fine too, as long as I can understand your vote.
