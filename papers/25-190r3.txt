I  Introduction

Paper 23-234r2 provides a comprehensive list of the IEEE-754
recommended operations, and calls out the subset that are not
yet part of the Fortran standard.

Paper 25-143 contains the Requirements and Specifications.  It further
lists each operation and connects each to its related Fortran operation.

This paper is to be the Edits paper

II Semantics

Only generic functions are to be added for these names, with
behavior to match that listed in IEEE 754 latest.

III Edits

[xv] Add to "Intrinsic procedures" the sentence:
"The new intrinsic functions COMPOUND, EXPM1, EXP10M1, EXP2M1,
LOGP1, LOG10P1, LOG2, LOG2P1, POW, ROOTN, and RSQRT were added
to correspond to ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2020 recommended operations."

16.9  Specifications of the standard intrinsic procedures

[412:13+] insert one new intrinsic {note: after COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT}

16.9.59+ COMPOUND(X, N)
  <<Description.>>  Exponential growth.
  <<Class.>> Elemental function.
  <<Arguments.>> X shall be of type real, and must be >=-1.
                 N shall be of numeric type.
  <<Result characteristics.>> Same as X.
  <<Result value.>> The result has a value equal to a processor-dependent
  approximation to (1+X)**N.


[423:28+] add these three new intrinsics {note: after EXP}

16.9.84+ EXPM1(X)
  <<Description.>> Exponential minus 1.
  <<Class.>> Elemental function.
  <<Argument.>> X shall be of type real or complex.
  <<Result characteristics.>> Same as X.
  <<Result value.>> The result has a value equal to a processor-dependent
  approximation to EXP(X)-1.  If X is of type complex, its imaginary part
  is regarded as a value in radians.

16.9.84++ EXP10M1(X)
  <<Description.>> Base 10 exponential minus 1.
  <<Class.>> Elemental function.
  <<Argument.>> X shall be of type real or complex.
  <<Result characteristics.>> Same as X.
  <<Result value.>> The result has a value equal to a processor-dependent
  approximation to (10**X)-1. If X is of type complex, its imaginary part
  is regarded as a value in radians.

16.9.84+++ EXP2M1(X)
  <<Description.>> Base 2 exponential minus 1.
  <<Class.>> Elemental function.
  <<Argument.>> X shall be of type real or complex.
  <<Result characteristics.>> Same as X.
  <<Result value.>> The result has a value equal to a processor-dependent
  approximation to (2**X)-1. If X is of type complex, its imaginary part
  is regarded as a value in radians.

[445:12+] insert one intrinsic: {note: after LOG}

16.9.128+ LOGP1(X)
  <<Description.>> Natural logarithm of a value plus 1.
  <<Class.>> Elemental function.
  <<Argument.>> X shall be of type real or complex.  If X is real its
  value shall be greater than -1.  If X is complex its value shall not
  be -1.
  <<Result characteristics.>> Same as X.
  <<Result value.>> The result has a value equal to a processor-dependent
  approximation to LOG(X+1).  A result of type complex is the principal
  value with imaginary part 'w' in the range -pi <= 'w' <= pi.  If the
  real part of X is less than -1 and the imaginary part of X is zero,
  then the imaginary part of the result is approximately pi if the
  imaginary part of X is positive real zero or the processor does not
  distinguish between positive and negative real zero, and approximately
  -pi if the imaginary part of X is negative real zero.

  <<Description.>> Computes the reciprocal of the square root of a
  given value.

  value shall be greater than or equal to zero.  If X is complex its
  value must not be zero.

  approximation to 1/SQRT(X).
