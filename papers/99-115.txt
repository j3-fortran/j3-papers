Subject: Edits for J3 notes, chapters 9-10
Date: March 3, 1999


Here are the edits to resolve most of the J3 internal notes in 99-007
from chapters 9 and 10.

If Van's paper on unit numbers for "*" passes, unresolved issues 63 and 64
could be addressed.  If Malcolm's paper on formatted stream I/O passes,
unresolved issue 68 could be addressed.

Unresolved issue 28:

    section 9.3 (internal files), [171:10+], add these new list items:

        (10) The initial rounding mode is processor dependent for an internal file.

	(11) The initial decimal edit mode is POINT for an internal file.

Typo correction
    section 9.4.4.11, [176:39],
        change "more" to "mode"


Unresolved issue 29:
    section 9.4.4.6, [175:34-37],
        replace "If NULL is specifed ..... treated as zeros." with
	
	It specifies the inital form of the blank interpretation mode (10.6.6)
	for all formatted input/output for this connection.  


    section 10.6.6, [223:12],
    change "to specify"
    to
    "to specify the blank interpretation mode. 
     The form of this mode controls"


Unresolved issue 1:
    section 9.5.1.11, [183:31]
    change "When" to "If"


Unresolved issue 4:
    section 9.5.1.11, [184:5+], add the following

    Within a scoping unit, 
    a pending I/O storage sequence <<affector>> is a variable that is referenced
    or defined, and whose definition or reference refers to any storage unit in
    any pending I/O storage sequence.  Note that a variable may be a
    pending I/O storage sequence affector in one scoping unit, but not in
    some other scoping unit, since pending I/O storage sequences only exist for
    the duration of an asynchronous data transfer operation (9.6).

Unresolved issue 8:
    delete J3 internal note [185:39-46].


Unresolved issue 69:
    in note 9.32 [186:7], 
    change "scalar and of intrinsic type" to "scalar"

    also [186:9-10], delete " of intrinsic type"

    section 9.5.2, [186:4+], add

        All scalar objects resulting when a data transfer statement's list items
        are expanded according to the rules in this section for handling array
	and derived type list items are called <<effective items>>.  Zero sized
	arrays and implied-DO lists with an iteration count of zero are ignored
	and are not considered to be effective list items.  A scalar character
	item of zero length is an effective list item.

    section 9.5.4.4, [190:6-8]
    Delete
	The next item to be processed in the list is called the next effective
	item. Zero-sized arrays and implied-DO lists with iteration counts of
	zero are ignored in determining the next effective item. A scalar
	character item of zero character length is treated as an effective item. 
    [190:12], add the following after "namelist-group-object-list."
    	The next item to be processed is called the next effective item.
        Effective items are derived from the input/output list items as
	described in 9.5.2.


Unresolved issue 3:
    Section 9.5.4, [188:2-3]
    replace
        execution of the current data transfer statement is terminated
    with
        steps 4-8 are skipped for the current data transfer statement
	and the IOSTAT and ERRMSG variables are set to values determined by the
	WAIT operation.

    note to Richard Maine, the text assumes that an error cannot occur when
    positioning the file after the data transfer, because, in an implementation,
    that positioning is part of the data transfer operation, and would have
    triggered an error in step (6).  Your note about getting an error when
    identifying the unit is correct, but a non-existent unit won't have
    any pending i/o operations, and establishing the format is ok.  I'd
    rather not skip the parts about transfering data, because it might
    suggest that one can have undefined/not associated list items if the
    unit number is bad.  Not a good suggestion.  So i'd suggest leaving
    this list a little vague about what happens for errors when identifying
    the unit.

Unresolved issue 23:
    Section 9.5.4.4.3 [195:12-14]
    replace the whole paragraph with
	If the parent data transfer statement is a READ statement, the
	processor shall define the effective list item from the parent READ
	statement with the value assigned to the <dtv> dumy argument (or some
	portion thereof) by the user defined derived type input procedure.

    [195:15-16]
    replace 
        "the <dtv> dummy argument shall have the value of the list item" 
    with
    	"the processor shall provide the value of the effective list item
	 in the <dtv> dummy argument"

    [195:17-20]
    replace
        The <v_list> argument shall have the user-specified values from the
	the v-list of the edit descriptor.  The <v_list> argument shall have
    with
        The processor shall provide the values from the v-list of the edit
	descriptor in the <v_list> dummy argument, with


Unresolved issue 70:
    section 9.2.3.2, [169:29+]
    Add the following paragraph,
        File positioning for child data transfer statements is described in
	9.5.4.4.3.

    section 9.5.4.4.3 [196:1-19], 
    replace [196:1-19] with
        Since a child data transfer statement does not position the file
	prior to data transfer, the child data transfer statement starts
	transfering data from wherever the file was positioned by the parent
	data transfer statement after processing the last effective list item
	or last record positioning edit descriptor.  This is usually in the
	middle of a record.

Unresolved issue 25:
    Section 9.8.1.28, [206:20+], add the following:
        The processor shall return PROCESSOR_DEFINED only if the current
	rounding control in effect behaves differently than the UP, DOWN, ZERO
	and NEAREST modes.

    also delete [206:25:31]


Unresolved issue 30:
    The addition for issue 25 make this issue moot, and the note refered
    to should be deleted.

    Section 9.8.1.28 [21:24],
    delete Note 9.57

Unresolved issue 24:
    This is still unresolved.  We will probably add many more tables for
    G formatting, 1 or 2 per rounding mode, to get everything just right
    (3 or 4 revisions from now)


Unresolved issue 31:
    We will introduce a new term, <<decimal symbol>>, instead of decimal
    point, which is defined as "." or "," depending on the current
    decimal edit mode.

    Add a new section, 10.5 (and renumber the existing 10.5 and later sections):
        10.5  Decimal symbol
	The <<decimal symbol>> is the character that appears
	after the units digit in the decimal representation of a real value
	in an internal or external file.
	When the decimal edit mode is POINT, the decimal symbol is a
	decimal point.  When the decimal edit mode is COMMA, the decimal
	symbol is a comma.  

    Globally change "decimal point" to "decimal symbol" EXCEPT for these
    (do this global change before entering text just above for issue 31):
   
        Do not change chapter 3, or [224:5]

        [225:41]
        replace 
            decimal point, or a comma if the decimal edit mode is COMMA,
        with
            decimal symbol

	

Unresolved issue 65:
    asks if we should allow a ";" as a value separator even when the decimal
    mode is ".".
    If we do, then we break (subtlely) compatibility with F95, where an
    undelimited character constant in namelist input can contain a ";"
    as long as the decimal edit mode is PERIOD.

    My inclination is to say no.  We force the user to get "." or ","
    correct for the decimal symbol, so why not require the correct
    separator.

    Delete [224:28-31]  (unresolved issue 65)
