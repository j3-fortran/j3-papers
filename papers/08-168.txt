Subject: Adding locks to the co-array core subset

Background:
-----------

Paper 08-126 is the critique of coarrays from the Rice University
group submitted at meeting 183. A reply to that paper was formed
following the meeting (see paper J3/08-16x).  One major issue, the
lack of a lock facility, was felt to be sufficiently important to have
in the initial Fortran 2008 lanugage. In anticipation of a formal
public comment on this topic, Sepcification, Syntax, and Edits are
provided below.


Specification:
--------------

Locks are scalar variables that have one of two values: locked or
unlocked. The operations that change the value of a lock are atomic,
so that multiple images might concurrently attempt to set its value to
locked (acquire the lock) or unlocked (release the lock), but only one
image will succeed.  OpenMP, UPC, and other programming models contain
tools to manipulate locks.

A lock variable permits fine-grain disjoint access to a data
structure.  Critical sections, by contrast, permit disjoint access to
a sequence of statements.  Using lock variables, one can scale the
amount of potential concurrency with the size of a data structure by
protecting sections of the data structure (e.g. nodes in a graph)
individually with locks, if desired.

Locks are scalar objects of an intrinsic opaque derived type, LOCK_T,
defined in the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV. This type is
default-initialized to unlocked. Typically, locks will be declared to
be coarrays.

New image control statements, LOCK and UNLOCK, are provided to alter
the values of locks.  Execution of either statement includes the
effect of executing a SYNC MEMORY statement.

A lock variable is currently locked by an image if its value was set
to locked by that image and has not been subsequently unlocked.

Execution of a LOCK statement without a SUCCESS= specifier causes the
<lock-variable> to be assigned the value of locked. If the lock
variable is currently locked by a different image, and no error
condition occurs, execution of the LOCK statement completes when the
lock is released by the other image and acquired by this image.

Execution of a LOCK statement with a SUCCESS= specifier causes the
<lock-variable> to be assigned the value locked and the value of the
SUCCESS variable to true, if it was currently unlocked. Otherwise, the
<lock-variable> is not changed and the value of the SUCCESS variable
is set to false.

The <lock-variable> in a LOCK statement shall not be currently locked
by the image executing the LOCK statement.

An error condition occurs if a LOCK statement specifies a lock
variable that is currently locked by the executing image.

Execution of an UNLOCK statement causes the value of the
<lock-variable> to be set to unlocked. The <lock-variable> shall be
currently locked by the executing image.

An error condition occurs if the value of the lock variable in an
UNLOCK statement is unlocked, or if the variable is currently locked
by a different image.


Example:

--------
USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV

TYPE(LOCK_T) :: queue_lock[*] ! Lock to manage the work queue
INTEGER :: work_queue_size[*]
TYPE(Task) :: work_queue(100)[*] ! List of tasks to perform

TYPE(Task) :: job ! Current task working on
INTEGER :: me

me=THIS_IMAGE()
DO
   ! Process the next item in your work queue

   LOCK(queue_lock) ! New segment A starts
   ! This segment A is ordered with respect to
   ! segment B executed by image me-1 below because of lock exclusion
   IF(work_queue_size>0) THEN
      ! Fetch the next job from the queue
      job=work_queue(work_queue_size)
      work_queue_size=work_queue_size-1
   END IF
   UNLOCK(queue_lock) ! Segment ends
   ... ! Actually process the task

   ! Add a new task on neighbors queue:
   LOCK(queue_lock[me+1]) ! Starts segment B
   ! This segment B is ordered with respect to
   ! segment A executed by image me+1 above because of lock exclusion
   IF(work_queue_size[me+1]<SIZE(work_queue)) THEN
      work_queue_size[me+1]=work_queue_size[me+1]+1
      work_queue(work_queue_size[me+1])[me+1]=job
   END IF
   UNLOCK(queue_lock[me+1]) ! Ends segment B

END DO
--------

One could view the execution of a CRITICAL construct as being
controlled by a single, program-wide lock variable associated with
that construct. This is, in fact, a likely implementation.  It is
sometimes useful, and also more scalable, to have the capability of
requiring mutual exclusion of the execution of a CRITICAL construct
only among a subset of the images, based on a data structure they
share.  This could be accomplished explicitly by placing the construct
block between a LOCK and UNLOCK statement pair, instead of CRITICAL /
END CRITICAL statements. Alternatively, and more structured, the lock
controlling execution of the construct could be specified as part of
an extended syntax for the CRITICAL statement. This capability is
provided as an extension of the locking capability.

Execution of a CRITICAL statement that specifies a lock variable has
the effect of the execution of a LOCK statement that specifies the
same lock variable and no other specifiers. The lock variable shall
not be currently locked by the executing image.  Execution of the
corresonding END CRITICAL statement has the effect of the execution of
an UNLOCK statement that specifies that lock variable. If a second
image executes a CRITICAL statement that specifies the same lock
variable, execution of its block is delayed until the image currently
holding the lock releases it.

Unlike the case of a CRITICAL construct without a lock variable, more
than one CRITICAL construct may specify the same lock variable, in
which case the execution of any of the set of blocks is restricted to
a single image.  It is also possible for two images to specify
different lock variables for a particular CRITICAL construct, allowing
for concurrent execution of the block by those two images.


Example:

--------
USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV

TYPE(LOCK_T) :: queue_lock[*] ! Lock to manage the work queue
INTEGER :: work_queue_size[*]
TYPE(Task) :: work_queue(100)[*] ! List of tasks to perform

TYPE(Task) :: job ! Current task working on
INTEGER :: me

me=THIS_IMAGE()
DO
   ! Process the next item in your work queue

   CRITICAL(queue_lock) ! New segment A starts
      ! This segment A is ordered with respect to
      ! segment B executed by image me-1 below because of lock
      exclusion
      IF(work_queue_size>0) THEN
         ! Fetch the next job from the queue
         job=work_queue(work_queue_size)
         work_queue_size=work_queue_size-1
      END IF
   END CRITICAL ! Segment ends
   ... ! Actually process the task

   ! Add a new task on neighbors queue:
   CRITICAL(queue_lock[me+1]) ! Starts segment B
      ! This segment B is ordered with respect to
      ! segment A executed by image me+1 above because of lock
      exclusion
      IF(work_queue_size[me+1]<SIZE(work_queue)) THEN
         work_queue_size[me+1]=work_queue_size[me+1]+1
         work_queue(work_queue_size[me+1])[me+1]=job
      END IF
   END CRITICAL ! Ends segment B

Edits:
------

------------------------------------
[28] In 2.2 "High level syntax" rule R214 "<action-stmt>" add two new
entries alphabetically:

"<<or>> <lock-stmt>"
"<<or>> <unlock-stmt>"

------------------------------------
[174:8.1.6p1] In R819 of "CRITICAL construct" append after "CRITICAL"

"[ ( <lock-variable> ) ]"

------------------------------------
[174:8.1.6p1] Following R819 of "CRITICAL construct" add a new syntax
rule and constraint:

"R819a  <lock-variable>  <<is>>  <scalar-variable>

 C813a (R819a) A <lock-variable> shall be of type LOCK_T defined in
 the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV."


------------------------------------
[175:8.1.6p3] At the beginning of paragraph 3 of "CRITICAL construct"
replace

"The processor"

with

"If a <lock-variable> does not appear in the CRITICAL statement, the
processor"

------------------------------------
[175:8.1.6p3] Move the second two sentences of paragraph 3 of
"CRITICAL construct", "The image shall not execute ... is therefore a
segment (8.5.1)." to the end of paragraph 2 of the same subclause.


------------------------------------
[175:8.1.6p3+] After paragraph 3 of "CRITICAL construct", add a new
paragraph:

"If a <lock-variable> appears in the CRITICAL statement, the construct
is executed as if the CRITICAL statement were replaced by a LOCK
statement with the same <lock-variable> and no other specifiers, and
the END CRITICAL statement were replaced with an UNLOCK statement with
the same <lock-variable>. Execution of a CRITICAL construct that
specifies a lock-variable on one image is ordered relative to the
execution of a CRITICAL construct the specifies the same lock variable
on a different image. These may be different constructs."


------------------------------------
[175:8.1.6Note8.10+] At the end of "CRITICAL construct", add a new
Note:

"NOTE 8.10a
The following example illustrates the manipulation of a shared work
queue using locked CRITICAL constructs:

USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV

TYPE(LOCK_T) :: queue_lock[*] ! Lock to manage the work queue
INTEGER :: work_queue_size[*]
TYPE(Task) :: work_queue(100)[*] ! List of tasks to perform

TYPE(Task) :: job ! Current task working on
INTEGER :: me

me=THIS_IMAGE()
DO
   ! Process the next item in your work queue

   CRITICAL(queue_lock) ! New segment A starts
      ! This segment A is ordered with respect to
      ! segment B executed by image me-1 below because of lock
      exclusion
      IF(work_queue_size>0) THEN
         ! Fetch the next job from the queue
         job=work_queue(work_queue_size)

         work_queue(work_queue_size[me+1])[me+1]=job
      END IF
   END CRITICAL ! Ends segment B

END DO
[End NOTE]"


------------------------------------
[187:8.5.1p2] In the bullet list of 8.5.1 "Image control statements",
after the entry that begins "CRITICAL ..." add a new entry:

"LOCK or UNLOCK statement;"


------------------------------------
[191] After subclause 8.5.4 "SYNC MEMORY statement", add a new
subclause:

"8.5.4a LOCK and UNLOCK statements

R862a <lock-stmt> <<is>> LOCK ( <lock-variable> [, <lock-stat-list>] )

R862b <lock-stat> <<is>>  SUCCESS=<scalar-logical-variable>
                  <<or>>  <sync-stat>

R862c <unlock-stmt> <<is>> UNLOCK ( <lock-variable> [, <sync-stat-list>] )


A <lock-variable> represents two values of a lock: locked and
unlocked. A lock is acquired by setting its value to locked, and
released by setting its value to unlocked.  A lock variable is
currently locked by an image if it value was set to locked by that
image and has not been subsequently set to unlocked.

Execution of a LOCK statement without a SUCCESS= specifier causes the
<lock-variable> to be assigned the value of locked. If the lock
variable is currently locked by a different image, execution of the
LOCK statement completes when the lock is released by the other image
and acquired by this image.

If a <lock-variable> has the value unlocked, execution of a LOCK
statement with a SUCCESS= specifier causes the <lock-variable> to be
assigned the value locked and the value of the SUCCESS variable to
true. Otherwise, the <lock-variable> is not changed and the value of
the SUCCESS variable is set to false.

The <lock-variable> in a LOCK statement shall not be currently locked
by the image executing the LOCK statement.

Execution of an UNLOCK statement causes the value of the
<lock-variable> to be set to unlocked. The <lock-variable> shall be
currently locked by the executing image.

NOTE 8.39a
A lock variable is effectively defined atomically by a LOCK or UNLOCK
statement. If LOCK statements on two images both attempt to acquire a
lock, one will succeed and the other will either fail, if a SUCCESS=
specifier was provided, or will wait until the lock is later released.
[End NOTE]

NOTE 8.39b
The following example illustrates the use of LOCK and UNLOCK
statements to manage a work queue:

USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV

TYPE(LOCK_T) :: queue_lock[*] ! Lock to manage the work queue
INTEGER :: work_queue_size[*]
TYPE(Task) :: work_queue(100)[*] ! List of tasks to perform

TYPE(Task) :: job ! Current task working on
INTEGER :: me

me=THIS_IMAGE()
DO
   ! Process the next item in your work queue

   LOCK(queue_lock) ! New segment A starts
   ! This segment A is ordered with respect to
   ! segment B executed by image me-1 below because of lock exclusion
   IF(work_queue_size>0) THEN
      ! Fetch the next job from the queue
      job=work_queue(work_queue_size)
      work_queue_size=work_queue_size-1
   END IF
   UNLOCK(queue_lock) ! Segment ends
   ... ! Actually process the task

   ! Add a new task on neighbors queue:
   LOCK(queue_lock[me+1]) ! Starts segment B
   ! This segment B is ordered with respect to
   ! segment A executed by image me+1 above because of lock exclusion
   IF(work_queue_size[me+1]<SIZE(work_queue)) THEN
      work_queue_size[me+1]=work_queue_size[me+1]+1
      work_queue(work_queue_size[me+1])[me+1]=job
   END IF
   UNLOCK(queue_lock[me+1]) ! Ends segment B

END DO
[End NOTE]"

------------------------------------
[192:8.5.5p1+] After paragraph 1 of "STAT= and ERRMSG= specifiers in
image execution control statements" add a new paragraph:

"If the STAT= specifier appears, successful execution of the LOCK or
UNLOCK statements casues the specified variable to become defined with
the value zero.  If an error condition occurs during execution of
either of these statements, the variable becomes defined with a
processor-dependent positive integer value.

NOTE 8.39a
An error condition occurs if a LOCK statement specifies a lock
variable that is currently locked by the executing image. An error
condition occurs if the value of the lock variable in an UNLOCK
statement is unlocked, or if the variable is currently locked by a
different image. An error condition may also occur if the implicit
SYNC MEMORY operation that occurs as part of the LOCK or UNLOCK
statement fails.
[End NOTE]"


------------------------------------
[192:8.5.5p2] In paragraph 2 of "STAT= and ERRMSG= specifiers in image
execution control statements" replace

"SYNC IMAGES, or SYNC MEMORY"

with

"SYNC IMAGES, SYNC MEMORY, LOCK, or UNLOCK"


------------------------------------
[397:13.8.2.13+] In the descriptions of the contents of the
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module (13.8.2), add a new subclause
following "IOSTAT_INQUIRE_INTERNAL_UNIT":

"13.8.2.13a  LOCK_T

LOCK_T is a derived type with private nonpointer, nonallocatable,
noncoarray components. Variables of type LOCK_T are use as
<lock-variable>s in LOCK and UNLOCK statements (\ref{LOCK and UNLOCK
statements}) or CRITICAL statements (\ref{CRITICAL statement})."


------------------------------------
[453:16.6.3p1] In the list in 16.6.3 "Variables that are initially
defined"

in list item (6) replace the final "." with ";"

and add to the end of the list:

"(7) variables of type LOCK_T defined in the intrinsic module
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV."

------------------------------------
[454:16.6.5p1] In the list in 16.6.5 "Events that cause variables to
become defined" add two new list items at the end:

"(29) Execution of a LOCK statement containing a SUCESS= specifier
     causes the specified logical variable to become defined. If the
     logical variable becomes defined with the value true, the
     <lock-variable> in the LOCK statement also becomes defined.

(30) Execution of a LOCK statement that does not contain a SUCCESS=
     specifier causee the <lock-variable> to become defined.

(31) Execution of an UNLOCK statement causes the <lock-variable> to
     become deifned.

(32) Execution of a CRITICAL statement containing a <lock-variable>
     causes the <lock-variable> to become defined.

(33) Execution of an END CRITICAL statement that terminates a critical
     construct whose CRITICAL statement contains a <lock-variable>
     causes that <lock-variable> to become defined."

------------------------------------
[456:16.6.7p1] In the list in 16.6.7 "Variable definition context",

in list item (13) replace the final "." with ";"

and add two new items at the end of the list:

"(14) a <lock-variable>;"

 (15) a SUCCESS= specifier in a LOCK statement."
