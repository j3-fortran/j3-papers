Subject: More editorial changes
Date: 2006/05/03

1. Introduction

This paper describes additional editorial changes which will be added to
standing document 008, as well as describing the differences between 06-169
and 06-169r1.

Those additional editorial changes which have been done to the 007 and
which affect c05 are also included in 06-169r1.

2. Differences between 06-169 and 06-169r1 (excluding those noted in 3.)

- Fixed broken cross-ref in the first sentence of 5.3.1.

- Fixed "to received data" -> "to receive data" in 5.3.11, 1st para.

- 5.3.11, Deleted the first of the paragraphs which started
  "The INTENT(OUT) attribute ...".  (Left in by mistake - the second such
  paragraph covers everything.)

- 5.3.12, Deleted extra space at the start of C533.
  Changed "generic name in one or more generic interfaces"
  to "generic name of one or more generic interfaces".

- 5.3.20, Changed
    "to manage the interactions with the non-Fortran processes"
  to
    "to manage any interaction with non-Fortran processes"
  since there is not necessarily any interaction or indeed any
  non-Fortran process involved.

3. Additional editorial changes

These changes have all been applied to the 007 sources and will therefore
appear in 06-007.  Note that many of these changes are mandated by the
current ISO directives.

- No more "Sections"; removed "Section" and ":" from the chapter titles,
  and all appearances of "Section" in the text have been changed to
  "Clause" or "Subclause" as appropriate.
  (And many occurrences of "section" to "clause", but not all.)

- 7.1.8.2 Integrity of parenthese, changed the enormously ambiguous
    "The sections that follow" (i.e. the whole rest of the standard)
  to
    "Subclauses 7.1.8.3 to 7.1.8.7".
  which is what it actually meant.

- 7.2 Interpretation of operations
  Introduced "7.2.1 General" in accordance with the ISO directives.
  Changed
    "... in the following sections" (i.e. the whole rest of the standard)
  to
    "in subclause 7.2".
  (Note that this is not ambiguous when one follows the ISO
   directives, a clause or subclause is the whole thing - there is
   never any text between 7.2 and 7.2.1.)

- In Annex C, fixed a hard-coded "Section 7" to
  "Clause \ref{D7:Expressions and assignment}".
  Actually, I'm not sure that it would not be better to make those 7.2.1
  (where array expressions are defined to be elemental), plus 7.4.1.3
  (where intrinsic assignment is defined to be elemental) would not be
  better for this one..

- Deleted C.1.1 Intrinsic and derived types.
  It was ancient stuff about how "this standard" was different from F77,
  and was not referenced from the main text.

- 13.8.2 introduced 13.8.2.1 "General", reworded "following subclauses"
  to "subclause 13.8.2".  It will get reworded more quite soon.

- We variously use "ONLY option", "ONLY qualifier", "ONLY clause" and
  "ONLY specifier", all to mean the same thing.  And "ONLY keyword".
  Changed them all to "ONLY option".

- Changed three "If RESULT is specified" to "If RESULT appears".

- 15.2, introduced 15.2.1 General and changed
    "The following subclauses"
  to
    "Clause \ref{D15:Interoperability between Fortran and C entities}".

- 1.4 item (4), Changed "through" to "to".  "Through" is not grammatical.
  (This change also improves the typesetting.)

- Revised many lists to conform with the ISO directives (except for the one
  about when to use letters and when to use numbers).  Thanks to Van for
  his help with this.
    [xiii] introduce by a complete sentence.
    [1:21-24] begin each item in lower case
    [1:27-2:7] begin each item in lower case
    [2:13-32] add a colon after "if" and begin each item in lower case
    [3:14] replace colon by period
    [4:9] replace colon by period
    [4:40-41] introduce by a complete sentence
    [6:12-14] introduce by a complete sentence
    [7:9-10] Replace by prose.
    [7:12-16] Replace by prose.
      "this document" -> "this part of ISO/IEC 1539".
    [7:17-18] Advising our future selves via the standard is inappropriate.
      Revised to say what I think we mean:
        "A future revision of this part of ISO/IEC 1539 might delete
         an obscolescent feature if its use has become insignificant."
      I am not really convinced we need even that.
    [7:19-20] Delete.  If we are convinced that a feature is so bad we want
      to delete it without putting it on notice for a revision, we will do
      so, regardless of this text.
    [7:22] Delete.  Fortran processors are REQUIRED to support these
           features, advising them to "support these features as long as
           they are widely used" is completely pointless.
    [12:1-3] begin each item in lower case
    [13:7-8] Replace
      "A generic interface block may also be used to specify that
       procedures may be invoked"
    with
      "A generic interface block can also be used to specify that a
       procedure can be invoked"
    because: "may" is only for permission, "can" is for possibility and
    capability.
    [15:9-10] Delete "The ... following:" (the previous sentence already
      introduces the list, this fragment was redundant).
    [23:5-12] Rewrite into prose.  This could be left as nested lists,
      but it is more straightforward as prose.
    [27:1] replace colon by period
    [41:5] Change "may be used only in the following ways:"
           to "shall be used only".
    [41:28] Change "following meaning:" to "following meanings.".
    [42:8] replace colon by period
    [43:7] replace
      "For the default character type, the only constraints on the collating
       sequence are the following:"
    with
      "The collating sequence of the default character type shall satisfy the
       following constraints."
    [59:3] replace colon by period
    [61:9] replace colon by period
    [62:10-14] replace semi-colons with commas, end item (2) with "and".

    [126:24-127:19] begin each item in lower case

    [205:26] delete "any of the following conditions are met:", begin each
    item in lower case, end each item but the last two with comma, and end
    the penultimate item with ", or".
    [216:38-217:2] change "in the following cases" to "when", delete "when"

    [217:14-25] begin each item in lower case
    [217:32-45] begin each item in lower case
    [218:6-20] replace the first item
      (1) if the pad mode has the value

    [434:20-23] replace intro "A <<scoping unit>> is", begin each item in

    the useless incorrect nonsense "may designate" junk.
    [437:6-7] replace non-ISO-directive-conforming lie with
      "The following Fortran 90 features are not required by Fortran 95,
       Fortran 2003, or this part of ISO/IEC 1539.".
    ROFL thinking what part of ISO/IEC 1539 they are required by, but
    them's thar brakes.  I'm not entirely satisfied by this sentence
    but at least it is now true *and* conformant with the ISO
    directives.
    BTW, surely "A similar result" should be "A better result that
    actually makes sense unlike the F77 definition"?  on line 10-11.
    [437:34] replace colon with period
    [437:34+1-4] replace table with bulleted list, yay!

    [469:24] replace colon with period
    [484:14-20] delete colon from intro, begin each item in lower case, end
    the first two items with a comma, and end the third item with ",
    and".
    [ac:throughout] Replace "I/O" with "input/output".
    [499:4-6] begin each item in lower case, replace semicolons with commas.

4. Other changes to 008.

None of these have as yet been done to the standard.  Soon?

- Consider changing "2.5 Fundamental terms" to conform to the ISO directives!

- c04 "Types", 3rd paragraph
  "A derived type is one that is defined by a derived-type definition"
  is a lie.  Fix.
  The paragraph following that one is a lie too.  Fix that one too.

- check every use of "may", as most of them are wrong.

- Consider rewriting 2.3.4 Execution sequence so that all of the exceptions
  are in the list of exceptions, instead of only half of them.  (RETURN,
  STOP and END are exceptions but called out in prose instead of being in
  the list; and worse, this makes the description hard to read.)

- Rewrite item (1) of 2.5.5 Definition to make it true.

- 3.1 Processor character set, why are "Control characters" and "Graphic
  characters" in bold (term definition font) when there is no definition?
  We are just using the terms from another standard - without reference...

- Replace short outer-level enumerated lists with bullet lists, except
  when an individual list item is referred to elsewhere in the
  standard (this is obvious from the LaTeX source of the list).

- Consider rewriting [217:11-26] and [217:29-45] into individual sentences.

- Consider eliminating duplication between list-directed and namelist.

- Consider changing "hold" to "apply" where it means the latter.

- Rewrite the "elemental operator" nonsense in c14.  There is no such
  thing.  Furthermore, the module has to define (private) procedures
  in the generic sets - describe them.  Ugh.

- Rewrite the first sentence of 14.1 so that it is completely true
  instead of only partially.

- Consider deleting 14.9.1 to 14.9.5 because they are unnecessarily
  duplicative and not formatted in accordance with ISO directives.

- Consider deleting the tables in c13 that are both redundant and
  unnecessary.  And not conformant with the ISO directives.

- Consider rewriting [408:2-21] into several distinct paragraphs
  instead of one enormous structured sentence.

- Replace I/O with input/output throughout.  We decided on this
  already once, why are we still inconsistent?

- Take a chainsaw to the glossary instead of a scalpel.
