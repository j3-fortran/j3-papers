16:7. Change 'components of intrinsic or of other derived types' to
'its components'.
[A subroutine component does not have a type. We do not need to be
precise here.]

16:32. After 'functions.' add 'In contexts where a structure component
that is a pointer refers to its target (if any), the structure
component is not a subobject.'
[I think we need to make this clear when we define the term
'subobject'.]

17:4. At line end, add 'named' before 'variable'.

19:4. Change 'An <<object>>' to 'A' and delete 'subobject selectors,
which are'.  [The term 'designator' is used also for procedures, see
20:9, for example.]

19:21-22. Delete 'or' on line 21; after '(16.4.3) 'add ', or inheritance
association (16.4.4)'; after 'use association,' add 'linkage association,'.

20:12. Change 'data object designator or procedure name' to 'data object
designator or procedure designator'.

20:33. Add period after '<n>'.

24:7+. The typeset grave accent is an open-quote symbol.
Can a grave accent be present instead of an open-quote symbol?
