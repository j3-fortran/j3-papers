NUMBER: F03/0109
TITLE: Referencing deferred binding via absent dummy argument
KEYWORDS: Type-bound procedure, deferred binding
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

The intent was that it would be impossible to reference a deferred
binding.  However, it doesn't appear to me that this intent was achieved.
Consider the following program

  program P
    type, abstract :: T
    contains
      procedure(sub), nopass, deferred :: deferred_proc
    end type T

    call sub

  contains

    subroutine Sub ( X )
      class(t), optional :: X
      call x%deferred_proc
    end subroutine Sub

  end program P

Is this a valid program?  If not, what restriction of the standard does it
violate?

Since x%deferred_proc has the NOPASS attribute, this does not require the
value of x (4.5.7) and thus is not a reference to x (2.5.6).  Therefore,
the first item in the second list in 12.4.1.2 (at [04-007:272:32-33]) does
not prohibit this.

ANSWER:

This was not intended to be a valid program. A type-bound procedure shall
not be invoked through an absent dummy argument. An edit is supplied to
clarify this situation.

The same flaw is present for procedure pointer component invocation.

EDITS:

Add new items to the second list in 12.4.1.6, [273:12+]

  "(11) It shall not be supplied as the <data-ref> in a
        <procedure-designator>.
   (12) It shall not be supplied as the <variable> in a
        <proc-component-ref>."
