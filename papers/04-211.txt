Title: Clarify "approximation" for real values

Submitted by: J3

Status: For Consideration

References: 

Basic Functionality: State in one place that the standard recognizes that
(essentially) all real and complex values and computations
involve approximations.

Rationale: In some places we say real computations are approximate
(e.g., SQRT). In other places we do not (e.g., +).

Probably nobody will think that + must be exact, but
why not state it clearly.

It will shorten the standard.

Estimated Impact: This is editorial only.

Detailed Specification: Put the words in the standard once.

Remove all/most of the occurrences of
"processor-dependent approximation".

History: Submitted as Pub-104
