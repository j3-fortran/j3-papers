Part 1: Interpretation Processing Rules
======================================================================

0. All interpretations are listed in J3 standing document 006.

1. Interpretations are processed by the J3/interp group and given a
   number.  The interpretation is marked "J3 consideration in
   progress".  An answer is formulated and presented to J3 in a
   meeting paper.

2. J3 votes on the answer at a J3 meeting; a simple majority vote
   marks the answer as "passed by J3 meeting".

3. Between J3 meetings the chair of /interp sends a J3 letter ballot
   to J3 to approve interp answers that have been "passed by J3
   meeting".  The letter ballot runs for 30 days.  Not voting on
   three of four consecutive J3 letter ballots is grounds to
   terminate J3 membership.  An interp answer passes by a 2/3rds
   vote; a no vote must be accompanied by an explanation of the
   changes necessary to change the member's vote to yes.

   J3/interp reserves the right to recall an interp answer for more
   study even if the answer passes.

4. The chair of J3/interp gathers all interp answers that are marked
   "passed by J3 letter ballot" and forwards them to the WG5
   convenor.  The WG5 convenor holds a ballot of individual members;
   a no vote must be accompanied by an explanation of the changes
   necessary to change the member's vote to yes.  The answers that
   pass this ballot become "WG5 approved".

   J3/interp reserves the right to recall an interp answer for more
   study even if the answer passes.

5. "WG5 approved" answers are processed into a corrigendum document
   by taking the edits from the interp answers and putting them in
   the format required by ISO.  A WG5 vote is made on forwarding the
   corrigendum to SC22.  Interps so forwarded are marked
   "Corrigendum".

6. J3/interp creates a edit for the next Fortran Standard if one is
   needed for all interps marked "Corrigendum".

Part 2: Active F90/F95 interpretations
======================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------

NUMBER: F90/0145
TITLE: Expressions in <type-spec> of a FUNCTION statement
KEYWORDS: expression - specification, expression - initialization,
          FUNCTION statement, host association, use association
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

The syntax rule R1217 shows that the type and type parameters of a
function can be specified in the FUNCTION statement (12.5.2.2).

(a) If a <type-spec> appears in a FUNCTION statement, can the
initialization and specification expressions of that <type-spec>
involve names of entities that are declared within the function or
are accessible there by host or use association?

(b) Section 5.1 states:

      "The <specification-expr> (7.1.6.2) of a <type-param-value>
       (5.1.1.5) or an <array-spec> (5.1.2.4) may be a nonconstant
       expression provided the specification expression is in an
       interface body (12.3.2.1) or in the specification part of a
       subprogram."

As a FUNCTION statement is not part of the specification part of a
subprogram, this text in the standard appears to distinguish between
FUNCTION statements that are in interface blocks and ones that are
not. This text seems to prohibit such examples as:

         INTEGER I
          ...
         CONTAINS
           CHARACTER*(I+1) FUNCTION F()
              ...
              COMMON // I
              ...

where it can be confusing as to which I is being referenced in the
FUNCTION statement.  While host association does not apply to
interface bodies, for consistency should the text quoted from Section
5.1 have been "... is in the specification part of an interface body
(12.3.2.1) or in the specification part of a subprogram."?

(c) Section 7.1.6.1 states:

      "If an initialization expression includes a reference to an
       inquiry function for a type parameter or an array bound of an
       object specified in the same <specification-part>, the type
       parameter or array bound must be specified in a prior
       specification of the <specification-part>."

Was this text intended to apply to FUNCTION statements even though
they are not part of any <specification-part>, thus disallowing
fragments such as:

      INTEGER (KIND=KIND(X)) FUNCTION F()
        INTEGER(KIND=KIND(0)) X
        ...

Similar text appears in Section 7.1.6.2.

ANSWER:

(a) A specification expression in the <type-spec> of a FUNCTION
statement may involve names of entities that are declared within the
function or are accessible there by host or use association, but an
initialization expression in such a <type-spec> may only involve
names that are accessible by host or use association.

(b) No.  It was not the intent of the standard to distinguish between
the two types of FUNCTION statements cited.  As elaborated in the
discussion of part (a), the standard intended to allow the
<type-spec> expression of a FUNCTION statement to be a nonconstant
expression.  The sentence cited is corrected with a supplied edit.

(c) Yes, the text cited from 7.1.6.1 was intended to apply to
FUNCTION statements.  The sentence quoted and the corresponding
sentence in 7.1.6.2 are corrected with supplied edits.  The code
fragment is not standard conforming.

Discussion:

(a) An initialization expression is a constant expression with an
additional rule relating to exponentiation (7.1.6.1).  Since it is a
constant expression, the only names it can contain are the names of
named constants, structure constructors, intrinsic procedures, and
variables whose type parameters or bounds are inquired about.

    * Named constant

      Section 5.1.2.1 states:

       "A named constant must not be referenced in any ... context
        unless it has been defined in a prior PARAMETER statement or
        type declaration statement using the PARAMETER attribute, or
        made accessible by use association or host association."

      Since the FUNCTION statement is the first statement of the
      scoping unit, there can be no prior PARAMETER statement or type
      declaration statement using the PARAMETER attribute, so the
      first clause does not apply. A named constant can appear in a
      <type-spec> of a function statement if it is accessible within
      the function by host or use association.

    * Structure constructor

      Rule R502 shows that the only opportunities for expressions to
      appear in <type-spec>s are in a <kind-selector> or in a
      <char-selector>.  However, a structure constructor can not
      appear in a <kind-selector> because rule R505 shows that a
      <kind-selector> must be an integer expression.  Similarly, R506
      shows that any initialization expression in a <char-selector>
      must be type integer.  Therefore, a structure constructor can
      not appear in an initialization expression in the <type-spec>
      of a FUNCTION statement.

    * Intrinsic procedure

      The intrinsic procedure names or classes of intrinsic
      procedures that may appear in an initialization expression are
      given in 7.1.6.1.

    * Variables whose type parameters or bounds are inquired about

      The text from section 7.1.6.1 as cited in question (c) was
      intended to apply to initialization expressions in the
      <type-spec> of a FUNCTION statement.  With the correction
      supplied, this means that if a variable appears as the argument
      to an inquiry intrinsic in the <type-spec> of a FUNCTION
      statement, the function must be a module procedure or an
      internal procedure, and the variable must exist in (be
      accessible from) the host scoping unit.

Rule R502 defines <type-spec>.  The only opportunity for a
<type-spec> to contain a <specification-expr> is when the data type
is character (<type-param-value> may be a <specification-expr>).
Section 7.1.6.2 states that a specification expression is a
restricted expression that is scalar, of type integer, and each
operation must be intrinsic.  In addition, rule (2) of 7.1.6.2 states
that a primary of a specification expression can be a dummy argument
that has neither the OPTIONAL nor INTENT(OUT) attribute.  The
following code fragment demonstrates a use of such a dummy argument:

              CHARACTER*(N+1) FUNCTION S(N)
              INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: N

Rule (2) also states that the primary can be a subobject of such a
dummy argument.  Section 6.1.2 indicates that a structure component
must not be referenced or defined before the declaration of the
parent object.  Similar rules are needed to prevent a substring from
being referenced ahead of the declaration of its parent, and an array
element or array section from being referenced ahead of the
declaration of the array.  Edits are provided to supply these rules.
Since a subobject can not be referenced before its parent object is
declared and the FUNCTION statement is the first statement of the
subprogram, the parent's declaration could not have occurred.  Thus a
subobject must not be referenced in the <type-spec> on a FUNCTION
statement for objects declared within the function.

Rule (3) states that a primary can be a variable that is in a common
block.  The following code fragment demonstrates a use of such a
common block member:

              CHARACTER*(N+1) FUNCTION S()
              ...
              COMMON N

As in rule (2), rule (3) allows a subobject of such a variable but
for the same reasons as above, such a subobject designator can not
appear in the <type-spec> expression of a FUNCTION statement.

Rule (4) states that a primary may be a variable that is accessible
by use association or host association.  The following code fragments
demonstrate uses of such variables:

              PROGRAM MAIN
              INTEGER :: N = 21
              ...
              CONTAINS
                CHARACTER(LEN = 2*N) FUNCTION SS(K)    ! N is host
                ...                                    !  associated.
                END FUNCTION
              END PROGRAM

    and

              MODULE MOD
              INTEGER K
              DATA K /20/
              END MODULE

              USE MOD
              ...
              END FUNCTION

Rule (4) also states that the primary can be a subobject of such a
use or host associated variable.

A structure constructor can not appear in a FUNCTION <type-spec>
specification expression because the expression must be of type
integer and any operations (which might yield an integer value from
one or more structure constructors) must be intrinsic.

Other rules of 7.1.6.2 state which intrinsic procedure names or
classes of intrinsic procedures may appear in a specification
expression.

Section 7.1.6.2 also states:

        A variable in a specification expression must have its type
        and type parameters, if any, specified by a previous
        declaration in the same scoping unit, or by the implicit type
        rules currently in effect for the scoping unit, or by host or
        use association.

The discussion above regarding specification expressions has already
ruled out "previous declarations" so the first clause of the cited
sentence does not apply.  The other clauses apply equally to a
FUNCTION statement <type-spec> and to type declaration statements
inside the function.

(b) When the discussion for part (a) is applied to the code fragment
provided, it means that the 'I' referenced in the <type-spec> of the
FUNCTION statement is the common block member.

NUMBER: F03/0030
TITLE:  IEEE divide by zero
KEYWORDS: IEEE-754, divide-by-zero
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 3

QUESTION:

Is infinity / 0.0 a divide by zero exception?
Is NaN / 0.0 a divide by zero exception?

Fortran 2003 defines (in 14.2) infinity / zero and NaN / zero
cases as IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO.  IEEE-754 defines (in 6.1 and 6.2)
those two as unexceptional.

ANSWER:

On an IEEE-conformant processor, these cases do not raise exceptions
(see clauses 6.1 and 6.2 of IEC 60559:1989).

The definitions in 14.2 were intended to describe IEC 60559:1989
exceptions with sufficient latitude to allow use on machines that do
not conform to IEC 60559:1989.  However, the definition of
IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO is not consistent with IEC 60559:1989.

Furthermore, the definition of the IEEE_OVERFLOW flag is also not
consistent with IEC 60559:1989, because this exception is not raised
for operations on infinite operands.

Additionally, if the data type is not an IEEE data type, but the
exception is supported, the circumstances under which the exception is
raised are processor dependent.

Edits are provided.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[403:7-9] Clause 14.3, first paragraph, first bullet (IEEE_OVERFLOW),
  Replace with
  "IEEE_OVERFLOW occurs in an intrinsic real addition, subtraction,
   multiplication, division, or conversion by the intrinsic function
   REAL, as specified by IEC 60559:1989 if IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE is
   true for the operands of the operation or conversion, and as
   determined by the processor otherwise.  It occurs in an intrinsic
   real exponentiation as determined by the processor.  It occurs in a
   complex operation, or conversion by the intrinsic function CMPLX,
   if it is caused by the calculation of the real or imaginary part of
   the result."

[403:10-11] Clause 14.3, first paragraph, second bullet
  (IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO),

13.7 [300:13-15] incorrectly requires an infinite result or a
NaN result to always signal some IEEE exception.

Consider changing [300:13] "infinite result" to "infinite result
(from finite arguments)".  Reason: IEEE-754 mathematical
operations on infinity that produce an infinity are
unexceptional.

Consider changing [300:14] "NaN result" to "NaN result (from
non-NaN arguments)".  Reason: IEEE-754 mathematical operations
on quiet NaN operands that produce a quiet NaN result are
unexceptional.

Consider adding to 13.7 [300:15+] something along the lines of:
"Unless specified otherwise, a math function with NaN
argument(s) shall return a NaN, which should be one of the NaN
arguments."  This allows not having to specify the results for
each specific math function.

Consider adding the above suggested cases to each of the 13.7.*
functions, perhaps, with a bold face IEEE sub-heading.

ANSWER:

The penultimate sentences of 13.7 was intended for the case
where all arguments on entry have normal or denormal values
and edits are supplied to correct this.

To specify the results of all the intrinsics for non-normal
values is beyond the scope of an interpretation. Perhaps this
should be considered for an extension that is adopted for the
next revision of the standard. Meanwhile, guidance is provided
by the second and third paragraphs of 14.8, which state

"The inquiry function IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN is provided to inquire
whether the processor supports IEEE NaNs. Where these are supported,
their behavior for unary and binary operations, including
those defined by intrinsic functions and by functions in intrinsic
modules, shall be consistent with the specifications in the IEEE
International Standard.

The inquiry function IEEE_SUPPORT_INF is provided to inquire whether
the processor supports IEEE infinities. Where these are supported,
their behavior for unary and binary operations, including
those defined by intrinsic functions and by functions in intrinsic
modules, shall be consistent with the specifications in the IEEE
International Standard. "


EDITS:

Page and line numbers refer to 04-007.

[300:13&14] Subclause 13.7. In the penultimate sentence, replace
"If" by "If the values of all input arguments are normal or
denormal and" and replace "if" by "if the values of all input
arguments are normal or denormal and"

TITLE: Polymorphic arguments to intrinsic procedures
KEYWORDS: polymorphism, intrinsic procedures
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: No edits in F2008 Corrigendum 3

QUESTION:

The descriptions of the intrinsic procedures often use the term "type"
without qualification.  It is unclear whether they mean "declared
type" or "dynamic type".  If they mean "dynamic type", then this would
appear to allow unlimited polymorphic arguments to intrinsic
procedures like ABS and SIN.  Resolution of generic intrinsic
procedures in this case would create an undue (and likely unintended)
burden on the processor, and the declared type of the result of such a
function call would be unclear as well.

Question 1:
Are the arguments of the intrinsic functions ALLOCATED, ASSOCIATED,
LBOUND, SHAPE, SIZE, and UBOUND permitted to be polymorphic?

Question 2:
(a) Is the ARRAY argument of the intrinsic function CSHIFT permitted
    to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If the argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?  What

    are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 4:
(a) Are the A and MOLD arguments of the intrinsic function
    EXTENDS_TYPE_OF permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on their types refer to their declared types
    or dynamic types?

Question 5: This question is deferred to interp F08/0102.
(a) Are the TSOURCE and FSOURCE arguments of the intrinsic function
    MERGE permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on the types of the arguments refer to their
    declared types or dynamic types?
(d) If either argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 6:
Are the FROM and TO arguments of the intrinsic function MOVE_ALLOC
permitted to be polymorphic?

Question 7:
(a) Are the ARRAY and VECTOR arguments of the intrinsic function PACK
    permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on the types of the arguments refer to their
    declared types or dynamic types?
(d) If either argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 8:
(a) Are the SOURCE and PAD arguments of the intrinsic function RESHAPE
    permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on the types of the arguments refer to their
    declared types or dynamic types?
(d) If either argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 9:
(a) Are the A and B arguments of the intrinsic function SAME_TYPE_AS
    permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on their types refer to their declared types
    or dynamic types?

Question 10:
(a) Is the SOURCE argument of the intrinsic function SPREAD permitted
    to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If the argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?  What
    are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 11:
(a) Is the SOURCE argument of the intrinsic function TRANSFER
    permitted to be polymorphic?
(b) Is the MOLD argument of the intrinsic function TRANSFER permitted
    to be polymorphic?

(c) If the MOLD argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 12:
(a) Is the MATRIX argument of the intrinsic function TRANSPOSE
    permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If the argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?  What
    are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

(c) Do the requirements on the types of the arguments refer to their
    declared types or dynamic types?
(d) If either argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 14:
Are any of the other arguments of any intrinsic procedure permitted to
be polymorphic?

ANSWER:

The assertion that it is unclear whether "type" means declared, dynamic,
or both, is misguided.  The general rule is that wherever it makes
sense, it means both.  Where only one meaning makes sense, it means
that one.  Where only one meaning is intended but it would otherwise
not be clear from context, it is qualified as "declared type" or
"dynamic type".

Answer 1:
Yes.

Answer 2:
(a) Yes.
(b) Yes.  "The result is of the type ... of ARRAY".

Answer 3:
(a) Yes.
(b) No.
(c) The requirements apply to both the declared type and the dynamic
    type.
(d) "The type has ... the type ... of ARRAY".  Therefore it is polymorphic
    if ARRAY is polymorphic.

Answer 4:
(a) Yes.
(b) No.
(c) The requirements refer to the declared type; this is explicitly
    stated.

Answer 5:  This question has been deferred to interp F08/0102
   TSOURCE and FSOURCE are required have the same declared type, but may be
   polymorphic.  The questions of what the requirements are on the dynamic type,
   and whether the result is polymorphic, are deferred to interp F08/0102.

Answer 6:
Yes.

Answer 7:
(a) Yes.
(b) No.
(c) The requirements refer to both the declared type and the dynamic
    type.  Note that this means that if either ARRAY or VECTOR is not
    polymorphic, the requirement for type matching means that the
    dynamic type of the polymorphic argument is known.
(d) The result "has the same type" as ARRAY, and therefore is polymorphic
    if ARRAY is polymorphic.

Answer 8:
(a) Yes.
(b) No.
(c) The requirements refer to both the declared type and the dynamic
    type.
(d) The result "has the same type" as SOURCE, and therefore is polymorphic
    if and only if SOURCE is polymorphic.

Answer 9:
(a) Yes.
(b) No.
(c) The requirements are explicitly stated to refer to the declared type.

Answer 10:
(a) Yes.
(b) Yes.  "The result is ... of the same type ... as ARRAY.".

Answer 11:
(a) Yes.
(b) Yes.
(c) "The result is of the same type ... as MOLD.".

Answer 12:
(a) Yes.
(b) Yes.  The declared and dynamic types of the result are those of
    the argument.

Answer 13:
(a) Yes.
(b) Yes.
(c) The requirements refer to both the declared type and the dynamic
    type.
(d) Yes.  The result has the same declared and dynamic types as VECTOR,
    and is polymorphic if and only if VECTOR is polymorphic.

Answer 14:
Yes.  For example, IMAGE_INDEX, LCOBOUND, PRESENT, STORAGE_SIZE, and
UCOBOUND.

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

MODULE m

  TYPE t
    INTEGER :: i
    INTEGER :: j
  END TYPE

  INTEGER :: ipos

  INTERFACE READ(FORMATTED)
    MODULE PROCEDURE formattedReadT
  END INTERFACE

CONTAINS

  SUBROUTINE formattedReadT (dtv, unit, iotype, vlist, iostat, iomsg)
    CLASS(T), INTENT(INOUT) :: dtv
    INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: unit
    CHARACTER(*), INTENT(IN) :: iotype
    INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: vlist(:)
    INTEGER, INTENT(OUT) :: iostat
    CHARACTER(*), INTENT(INOUT) :: iomsg

    READ(unit, *) dtv%i
    INQUIRE(unit, POS=ipos)
    READ(unit, *) dtv%j
  END SUBROUTINE

END MODULE

PROGRAM foo
  USE m
  TYPE(t) :: a
  OPEN(10, FILE='file.txt', ACCESS='stream', FORM='formatted')
  WRITE(10, '(A)') '2*3 5'
  REWIND(10)
  READ(10, *) a
  PRINT *, a%i, a%j, ipos
END PROGRAM

10.9 of Fortran 2003 states that the r*c form of list-directed input
is equivalent to r occurrences of c.  So, when the read is performed,
it is as if the input record contains two occurrences of the number 3.

The first child read statement reads the first 3, and does not advance
the file position to the next record (because it is a child data
transfer statement).  It appears that the second read statement should
read the second 3.  But the file position between the child read
statements is unclear.

What does the above program print?

ANSWER:

The standard does specify the behavior of a processor when a list
directed input record contains a r*c constant, but that is irrelevant
to the question at hand.  Executing an INQUIRE statement using an
internal unit is prohibited by [235:16] 9.10.2.1p2.  The program does
not conform.

The question raised at m200 was about the definition of "internal unit
(9.6.4.8.3)" [226:4], which seems to conflict with the Terms and
Definitions [12:26-31]:

    1.3.94
     internal file
      character variable that is connected to an internal unit (9.4)

    1.3.95
     internal unit
      input/output unit that is connected to an internal file (9.5.4)

The clarification we needed but couldn't find is probably [208:8-10]:

    An internal unit is used to refer to an internal file and is
    specified by an internal-file-variable or a file-unit-number
    whose value is equal to the unit argument of an active defined
    input/output procedure (9.6.4.8).

TITLE: The BIND attribute for C_PTR and C_FUNPTR
KEYWORDS: BIND attribute, C_PTR, C_FUNPTR, private components
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 3

QUESTION:

1. Do the derived types C_PTR and C_FUNPTR have the BIND attribute?

This affects whether an object of one of these types is permitted
directly in COMMON.  C5101 in the Fortran 2008 standard states "If a
common-block-object is of a derived type, it shall be a sequence type
or a type with the BIND attribute and it shall have no default
initialization."

2. Whether the derived types C_PTR and C_FUNPTR have the BIND
attribute affects whether they are extensible.  Subclause 4.5.7.1 of
the Fortran 2008 standard states "A nonsequence derived type that does
not have the BIND attribute is an extensible type."  Are these types
extensible?

3. Subclause 15.3.3 of the Fortran 2008 standard states that C_PTR and
C_FUNPTR are derived types with private components. Are user-defined
derived types with the BIND attribute permitted to have private
components?

ANSWER:

1. No, these types do not have the BIND attribute.  15.3.3 does not
specify that they have the BIND attribute.  15.3.4 does not require
them to have the BIND attribute in order to make them interoperable.
15.3.5 would require them to interoperate with a C struct if they had
the BIND attribute; this is absurd, since C object pointers and C
function pointers are clearly not structs.

Note that whether these types have default initialization is not
specified by the standard, so possession of BIND would not necessarily
have allowed them in COMMON anyway.

Edits are provided to correct incomplete, and thus misleading,
statements about derived types and the BIND attribute.

2. No, these types were not intended to be extensible.  It was an
oversight that these types were not explicitly excluded from being
extensible by subclause 4.5.7.1 paragraph 1 of the Fortran 2008
standard.  An edit is provided to correct this.

3. Yes, a user-defined derived type with the BIND attribute is
permitted to have private components.  This situation is the same
as for SEQUENCE types, which are similar (but not interoperable).
As with SEQUENCE types, making a component PRIVATE does prevent
access, in a conforming program, to the component by a programmer who
is sufficiently determined; however, it continues to fulfill the
software engineering role for which it was intended.  Note further
that there are many other situations where two different Fortran
derived types will interoperate with the same C derived type; this is
not a defect in either standard, but simply a consequence of the two
languages having different approaches to type compatibility.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[19:15-16] In 1.3.147.6,
  replace the definition of "extensible type"
  with "type that may be extended using the EXTENDS clause (4.5.7.1)".
{Repair definition of extensible type.}

[77:3] In 4.5.7.1p1,
  After "A derived type" insert
    ", other than the type C_PTR or C_FUNPTR from the intrinsic module
     ISO_C_BINDING,"
{Prohibit these types from subsequent extension.}

[431:6] In 15.3.4p1, replace the first sentence with
  "Interoperability between derived types in Fortran and struct types
   in C is provided by the BIND attribute on the Fortran type."
{Reduce misleading opening blather - this is just here so we didn't
 start the subclause with a bunch of constraints.  Alternatively we
 could move paragraph 2 (and note 15.12) to replace paragraph 1.}

  After "is interoperable" insert "with a C struct type".
{Correct another misleading sentence.}

[431:13-18] In 15.3.4p2,
  Change all four occurrences of "Fortran derived type"
  to "derived type";
  change the single occurrence of "Fortran type" to "derived type".
{Remove unnecessary and confusing qualification of "derived type" with
 "Fortran".}

  Rich Bleikamp's NO comment for F03/0059:

    The replacement text reads "if the variable would not be processed
    by a UDDTIO ...", but I think the presence of an object designator
    might actually determine whether or not the object designator is
    processed by a UDDTIO routine (sort of the reverse decision
    process than what is being suggested, where being processed by a
    UDDTIO routine precludes the use of a non-simple variable name in
    the input record).

    Second, the sentence immediately after the replaced text talks
    about "Successive qualifications" being applied to the name.  I
    think this reads awkwardly with the suggested edit.

    Third, I think the answer may be wrong.  For namelist input, we
    should allow (perhaps we already do) object designators all the
    time, and just not invoke the UDDTIO routine if the object
    designator is not a simple  variable name, or if the resulting
    objects datatype/shape do not match an existing interface for a
    UDDTIO routine.  Also, its not clear to me (its too late in the
    day), but perhaps we really want to allow an object designator
    that's an array element reference to invoke a UDDTIO routine.
    We could use the datatype and shape of the object designator to
    determine whether or not a UDDTIO routine should be invoked
    (still a compile time decision).  I'm not at all sure we'd want
    to allow component references in such a case, or perhaps a
    component reference in the input record just precludes the
    possibility of invoking a UDDTIO routine for that input value.

    The tradeoffs here are:
    1) allow some more functionality (which we may already allow),
       such as array element references appearing in a namelist input
       record (as a namelist group object name, possibly qualified),
       and still cause a UDDTIO routine to be invoked, and

    2) keep the rules simple enough that the user and compiler's I/O
      library can easily agree on what's supposed to happen, and
      what input values are therefore allowed.

    I was going to suggest a replacement edit, but my head hurts too
    much :).

TITLE: Recursive declaration of procedure interfaces
KEYWORDS: procedure, interface
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 3

QUESTION:

Q1. Consider the following program:

      PROGRAM foo
        PROCEDURE(sub) :: p
        INTERFACE
          SUBROUTINE sub(p2)
            IMPORT p
            PROCEDURE(p) :: p2
          END SUBROUTINE
        END INTERFACE
      END PROGRAM

C1216 appears to prohibit the case of an interface name in a procedure
declaration statement being the name of something declared in a later
procedure declaration statement.  But it does not appear to prohibit
the case of an interface name being the name of something declared in
a later interface body.

In the above program, the characteristics of p rely on the
characteristics of sub.  The characteristics of sub, in turn, rely on
the characteristics of p.

Is this program standard-conforming?

Q2. Consider the module

    MODULE m1
    CONTAINS
      SUBROUTINE s(p)
        PROCEDURE(s) :: p
      END SUBROUTINE
    END MODULE

Constraint C1216 does not apply here since "s" is not declared by a
procedure declaration statement; unlike Q1, it is also not declared by
an interface body.  However, the characteristics of S have not been
determined before the procedure declaration statement has been
processed, and that cannot be processed until we know what the
interface of S is.

Is this program unit standard-conforming?

Q3. Consider the module

    MODULE m2
    CONTAINS
      SUBROUTINE s1(a)
        PROCEDURE(s2) :: a
      END SUBROUTINE
      SUBROUTINE s2(b)
        PROCEDURE(s1) :: b
      END SUBROUTINE
    END MODULE

The interface of A depends on the interface of S2, which depends on
the characteristics of B, which depends on the characteristics of S1,
which depends on the characteristics of A; a circular dependency.

Is this program unit standard-conforming?

Q4. Consider

      MODULE m3
        PROCEDURE(s),POINTER :: sptr
      CONTAINS
        SUBROUTINE s(p)
          PROCEDURE(sptr) :: p
        END SUBROUTINE
      END MODULE

In the normal course of events there is no problem declaring a
procedure pointer to have the interface of a module procedure that is
defined later, and this is desirable, but in this case there seems to
be a circular dependency between the characteristics of sptr, s, and
p.

Is this program unit standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

None of the examples are standard-conforming, as the standard does not
establish an interpretation for them.

An edit is provided to clarify this.

EDIT to 10-007r1:

QUESTION:

Section 7.1.7 of the Fortran 2008 standard says that if the value of an

standard-conforming to use the predetermined value.

Consider the subprogram

        SUBROUTINE S()
        USE, INTRINSIC :: IEEE_ARITHMETIC
        USE, INTRINSIC :: IEEE_FEATURES

        INTEGER, PARAMETER :: sp = IEEE_SELECTED_REAL_KIND(6,30)

        END

(1) Is a processor permitted always to print zero for the residual
    Z1 - Z2 ?
(2) Same question, after giving X and Y the PARAMETER attribute.

ANSWER:

(1) Yes.  The processor is allowed to evaluate expressions (constant
or otherwise) in any mathematically equivalent way.  In particular, it
is permitted to evaluate using higher precision than any precision
available when the program is executed.  For example, it might compute
Z1 == Z2 == 0.67222259081253, then compute Z1 - Z2 == 0.0, regardless
of how the program might do rounding at the seventh decimal digit when
it is executed.

(2) Yes, for the same reasons as question (1).

Bader NO vote:

The answers given to both (1) and (2) in the interp appear to me
to be counterintuitive; the programmer would expect that the
calculation of Z1 and Z2 respectively obey the imposed rounding
mode. In particular, I suspect there are situations where it is
more obvious to the compiler than to the programmer that expressions
are evaluated at compile time, and that different processors may
have differing capabilities in identifying such expressions. The
resolution of such situations is one target that the IEEE facilities
were designed for. I therefore am in favor of the stance that, if
supported, the setting of the rounding mode should take precedence
over processor-dependent compile-time evaluations.

Corbett NO vote:

I disagree with the interpretation given.  I believe that the
assignments should require conversions to be done and that the
conversions should be done in accord with the rounding mode
currently in effect.  Therefore, the results should not be zero.

Long NO vote:

I was confused by John's comment that the rounding mode on
entry to the subroutine affected the value of Z1 since the computation
of Z1 follows a call that resets the rounding mode.  I think the real
question here is what the standard means by "mathematical".  I had
always thought in terms of things like algebra.  John's answer seems
to imply that computational numerics (as specified by IEEE) are part
of the concept of "mathematical".  In other contexts, I think that
John's interpretation could be harmful.  On the other hand, the
current answer does seem to make the usefulness of the
IEEE_SET_ROUNDING_MODE routine more limited that would be
expected. Also, does the concept of mathematically equivalent apply to
the aggregation of multiple statements, or does it apply to just one
expression?  A processor that used the "mathematically equivalent"
argument to get 0 would need to forward sub the expressions for Z1 and
Z2 into the print statement to get X*Y - X*Y.  I don't think we
intended to allow forward substitution of expressions across one of
the IEEE mode setting routines.

Maclaren comment:

This relates to F03/0065, but is the other way round.  Unlike that one,
I consider this consistent with the majority of the semantic wording in
the C standard.

Muxworthy No vote:

I agree with John's vote.

Reid NO vote:

The IEEE rounding mode on entry to the procedure may vary from
call to call. The value of Z1 depends on this rounding mode.
Therefore, the processor should not always print zero for Z1-Z2.
Whether or not Z1 and Z2 have the PARAMETER attribute makes no
difference. Yes, the processor is allowed to evaluate an
expression in any mathematically equivalent way, but here the
mathematics dictates that a particular form of rounding, defined
in the IEEE standard, be applied.

Snyder NO vote:

    The answer makes rounding mode changes pointless.

    The work-around usually advanced to cause rounding mode changes to
    have effect (but not advanced in the answer to the interpretation)
    is to store intermediate results that are computed with different
    rounding modes in VOLATILE variables if they are ultimately to be
    combined in a single expression.

    Subclause 5.3.19 states, in part, however, that "The VOLATILE
    attribute specifies that an object may be referenced, defined, or
    become undefined, by means not specified by the program."  Setting
    the rounding mode is done by means that ARE specified by the
    program, so the advice is not germane.  One who reads subclauses
    5.3.19, 14.4, 14.11.6, and 14.11.21, and the answer to this
    interpretation, might not realize that the use of VOLATILE variables
    is required, under the present interpretation, for subclauses 14.4,
    14.11.6, and 14.11.21 to be meaningful.

    A better answer would have been to amend 7.1.5.2.4 to require that
    all entities within the expression are evaluated with the same
    rounding mode, or to specify that quantities evaluated with
    different rounding modes cannot be considered to be mathematically
    equivalent, even if evaluated by textually identical expressions.
    This might require processors either to abandon certain
    optimizations, or to perform more detailed dataflow analysis that
    propagates rounding mode to determine when those optimizations are
    permitted.

    If the position implied by the answer to this interpretation is to
    be maintained, the absence of edits is entirely inadequate.  The
    definition of VOLATILE must be changed to encompass actions that ARE
    specified by the program, and to encompass advice concerning
    rounding mode changes.  Advice to store intermediate results that
    are computed with different rounding modes into VOLATILE variables,
    if they are to be combined in a single expression, must be included
    in subclauses 14.4 and 14.11.21.

    During the requirements phase for the 2008 standard, there was a
    request (in 04-219) for a "strict mode" similar to that described in
    section G.2 of the Ada standard, in which rounding mode settings
    would actually have an effect without needing to resort to VOLATILE
    variables.  If a "strict mode" had been provided, it might have made
    sense to allow a processor to ignore rounding mode changes outside
    strict regions.  A request for a "strict mode" will be presented
    during the requirements-gathering phase for the next revision of the
    standard, for this as well as other reasons.

No it does not.  IEEE peculiarities play no part in the mathematical
Reals.

IEEE is merely one form of computer arithmetic.  (It would make very
bad mathematics, since IEEE numbers are not even a subset of the
2-point compactification of the Reals, thus nearly all mathematical
identities and theorems about the Reals would get destroyed.)  Computer
arithmetic is *computational* not *mathematical*.  ALL computer
arithmetics frequently give different computational answers for
mathematically-equivalent expressions.

And I cannot believe you are again trotting out this nonsense saying
constant expressions should not be treated as constant.  If I have
   "REAL(KIND=INT(a+b)) :: x(INT(a+b)) = a+b; y=a+b",
with a and b being floating-point named constants, I am not allowed
to evaluate a+b at compile time?  Surely you jest.  Or I can in the
KIND= but not in the array bound?  Unless the array is in COMMON or
has the SAVE attribute?  Surely you jest even more.  Or I can
everywhere except in the "y ="?  You cannot be serious.

Furthermore, the rationale you are using is applicable to all routines
regardless of whether they call IEEE_SET_ROUNDING and would thereby
destroy many basic optimisations.  You.Really.Can.Not.Be.Serious.

TITLE: Error in field width for special cases of signed INFINITY
       output
KEYWORDS: formatted output, signed infinity
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 3

QUESTION:

Is there an error in the description for the output of a IEEE infinity
with a sign and a field width of 3 or 8?

Fortran 2008, 10.7.2.3.2 paragraph 7, [252:33-34], describes the
output of IEEE infinities; this specifies asterisks (field overflow) if
the field width is less than 3, and omission of "inity" if the field
width is less than 8.  However, this does not take into account the
fact that there might be a plus or minus sign in the field.

The current text also fails to take into account the case of <w> = 0,
for both Infinity and NaN values.

ANSWER:

Yes, there is an error in the special cases.  Edits are provided to
correctly describe the required field widths for signed infinities.
An edit is also provided to repair the description of the output of
NaN values.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[252:33-34] 10.7.2.3.2p7, Replace "If <w> is ... produced." with

  "The minimum field width required for output of the form 'Inf' is 3
   if no sign is produced, and 4 otherwise.  If <w> is greater than
   zero but less than the minimum required, the field is filled with
   asterisks.  The minimum field width for output of the form
   'Infinity' is 8 if no sign is produced and 9 otherwise.  If <w>
   is greater than or equal to the minimum required for the form
   'Infinity', the form 'Infinity' is output.  If <w> is zero or <w>
   is less than the minimum required for the form 'Infinity' and
   greater than or equal to the minimum required for the form 'Inf',
   the form 'Inf' is output.  Otherwise, the field is filled with
   asterisks."

[252:37] Same subclause, p8, Replace "If <w> ... askerisks." with

  "If <w> is greater than zero and less than 3, the field is filled
   with asterisks.  If <w> is zero, the output field is 'NaN'.".

NUMBER: F03/0121
TITLE: Precise FP semantics of the REAL intrinsic
KEYWORDS: REAL intrinsic
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Must the intrinsic function REAL with KIND parameter wp return a value
that is a REAL (KIND=wp) floating point number?

RATIONALE FOR THE QUESTION:

Computer hardware may use a wider floating-point format for registers
than for memory; e.g., 80 bits for registers and 64 bits for memory
for the case of standard double precision floating point numbers.
Some algorithms require a high level of control over floating point
semantics.  If the intrinsic function REAL with KIND parameter wp is
guaranteed to return a REAL (KIND=wp) result then a programmer can use
this to force intermediate results into main memory format, never mind
that the optimizing compiler may have placed the intermediate in a
register.

I am interested in a J3 interpretation of this matter, especially a
loud and clear affirmative interpretation, because it appears that
some present Fortran compilers optimize away my explicit use of the
REAL intrinsic.  The context is code for compensated summation (Kahan
summation).  I appreciate that parentheses are inviolable courtesy of
the Fortran standard, but in order to have code that cannot be broken
by an optimizing compiler I seem to need also a language mechanism to
force intermediate results into main memory format.

Bas Braams

ANSWER:

Yes, for purposes of determining the type and kind of the result, for
use in subclause 7.1.9.3, the result of the intrinsic function REAL with
KIND argument wp returns a value that is of type REAL(KIND=wp).
However, if it is used within an expression involving intrinsic
operations,
  "the processor may evaluate any mathematically equivalent
   expression, provided that the integrity of parentheses is not
   violated."
and
  "mathematically equivalent expressions of numeric type may produce
   different computational results",
which means that it is unlikely to serve your purpose.

Intermediate results can be rounded to storage format by assignment to a
VOLATILE variable.

F03/0121

Bader NO vote:

The answer as a whole seems misleading; given the specification
of the REAL intrinsic and existing rules for type conversions (or
their absence) in expressions, the answer should simply be "yes".
The reference to mathematically equivalent expressions is mostly
irrelevant (since by parenthesization the programmer's purpose
should very likely be achievable), and that to VOLATILE variables
is simply unnecessary.

Corbett NO vote:

I previously voted for the answer given.  Since then, I
have been convinced I was mistaken.  I no longer think
that REAL(X), where X has type REAL but has a different
kind type parameter value from that of type default real,
should be considered mathematically equivalent to X.  I
now agree with Mr. Braams that the intrinsic function REAL
should do a real conversion.

I agree with Van that nothing in the standard or in the
existing interpretations requires VOLATILE to force a
conversion.  Interpretation F90/000001 is the only
interpretation I have found that addresses the issue,
and it, of course, could not require the use of VOLATILE.
I agree with John that VOLATILE should not be required to
force a conversion.

Long NO vote:

Similar to F03/0084, this hinges on the meaning of "mathematical".
I'm not convinced that a processor is allowed to treat
X and REAL(X,wp) as mathematically equivalent.  The REAL function
(may) perform an operation that is outside the scope of normal
algebra.

Maclaren comment:

The recommendation to use VOLATILE is wrong.  There is a common myth in
among C and C++ programmers and even in informative text in the
standards that volatile implies this semantic, but it is not justified
by their normative text, nor do all compilers support it.  Fortran
should not follow suit - in particular, Fortran 2008 5.3.19 makes no
such guarantee.

In particular, because 5.3.19 provides licence to the processor and not
to the programmer, a compiler is at liberty to optimise all references
to VOLATILE variables if it does not provide any method of accessing it
other than those specified by the program.  Regrettably, the correct
response is:

   There is no feature in Fortran to provide this facility, though
   assignment to a VOLATILE variable will often work.  On some
   processors, making that a BIND(C) variable in a module will be
   needed but, on a few, this recipe will not work at all.

This should be addressed properly in a future revision.

Muxworthy comment:

Like Van, I find the Answer unsatisfactory although the outcome (no
edit) is correct.  The answer is Yes.  This is stated clearly in
13.7.138.  What a processor might or might not do behind the scenes is
irrelevant.  If it does not obey 13.7.138 it is non-standard-
conforming.  (We are talking about a high-level language, not C).

Reid NO vote:

I think it is unacceptable to recommend the use of the VOLATILE
attribute for a variable that is referenced, defined, or becomes
undefined only within the Fortran program. The desired effect
may be obtained by assigning the intermediate result to a
variable without the VOLATILE attribute because this rules out
the exceptions explained in the final sentence of the first
paragraph of the answer ("Furthermore, ...").

Snyder NO vote:

    The answer refers to subclause 7.1.5.2.4 without identifying that
    subclause: "the processor may evaluate any mathematically
    equivalent expression, provided that the integrity of parentheses is
    not violated," and uses that as justification for the answer.
    Subclause 7.1.5.2.4 is entirely irrelevant to the question.

    Subclause 4.1.2 specifies that "For each type there is a set of
    valid values."  Subclause 4.2 specifies that "the set of values...
    depend[s] on the values of the parameters."

    Subclause 13.7.2, as amended by the answer to interp F08/0008,
    says, in part, "A program shall not invoke an intrinsic procedure
    under circumstances where a value ... returned as a function result
    is not representable by objects of the specified type and type
    parameters."

    Allowing the REAL intrinsic function to return a result that is
    claimed to have a specified kind, and a value that is not a member
    of the set of valid values for that kind, violates the requirements
    of subclauses 4.1.2, 4.2, and 13.7.1 as amended by interpretation
    F08/0008.  An interpretation should not introduce an inconsistency
    that will later need to be resolved by yet another interpretation.
    Even if F08/0008 were to fail, the result of the answer to this
    interpretation would be to introduce a conflict to 13.7.1 status quo
    ante, which reads, in part, "A program is prohibited from invoking
    an intrinsic procedure under circumstances where a value to be
    returned in a subroutine argument or function result is outside the
    range of values representable by objects of the specified type and
    type parameters," and continues with caveats not germane to the
    present interpretation.

    The only reason ever to invoke the REAL intrinsic function with a
    real argument and a KIND argument is to produce a result with the
    specified kind, and a value that is a member of the set of valid
    values for that kind.  This is exceedingly rare, except perhaps as
    an actual argument (where the processor must necessarily produce a
    value that is a member of the set of valid values, and additionally
    is represented by the specified type and kind), and therefore
    requiring processors to produce a value for the result of REAL that
    is a member of the set of valid values for the kind of the result
    would have no measurable effect on performance in any program other
    than an arcane SPEC benchmark.

    The answer should be "Although a processor is allowed to replace an
    expression with a mathematically equivalent expression, subclauses
    4.1.2, 4.2, and 13.7.1 (or 13.7.1 as amended by interpretation
    F08/0008) require the value of the result of every intrinsic
    function to be a member of the set of valid values for the type and
    kind of the function result."  No normative edits would be required,
    although it would be helpful to add a recommendation in a note (or a
    requirement) to 13.7.138p5 Case (i) that the result have a value
    that is not different from the argument by more than one unit in its
    least significant place (unless the argument is NaN), and that it be
    rounded according to IEC 60559:1989 and the rounding mode currently
    in effect if the IEEE_ARITHMETIC module is accessible (unless the
    argument is NaN).

    Advice in the presently proposed answer is offered to use the
    VOLATILE attribute.  Subclause 5.3.19 states, in part, however,
    that "The VOLATILE attribute specifies that an object may be
    referenced, defined, or become undefined, by means not specified by
    the program."  Invoking the REAL intrinsic function is a means that
    IS specified by the program, so the advice is not germane.

    One who reads subclauses 4.1.2, 4.2, 5.3.19, 7.1.5.2.4 and 13.7.1
    would have no clue that the way to make REAL operate as essentially
    all users expect it to operate is to store its result into a
    variable that has the VOLATILE attribute!  If one must have the
    presently proposed answer, having no edits is entirely inadequate.
    Subclause 5.3.19 must be amended to include effects that ARE
    specified by the program.  Subclauses 5.3.19 and 13.7.138 must be
    amended to include advice to use the VOLATILE attribute to make REAL
    function as essentially all users expect it to.  Further, there must
    be an explicit exemption for REAL in subclause 13.7.1, and maybe in
    4.1.2 and 4.2 as well.

    A perverse reading of 13.7.1, adroitly sidestepping subclauses 4.1.2
    and 4.2, might be that a function is allowed to return a value that
    is not a member of the set of valid values for the type and kind of
    the result, but that a program is not allowed to invoke the function
    in such a way as to produce that result.  This would make it illegal
    instead of pointless to invoke the REAL intrinsic function with the
    hope to produce a value that is a member of the set of valid values
    for the kind of the result.  That is, for example, that REAL is
    permitted to act consistently with the present answer to this
    interpretation, but a program is not permitted to invoke
    REAL(3.14159265358979323846264338d0,kind(1.0e0)) if the processor
    uses 32-bit IEEE arithmetic for default real, because the result
    would not be a member of the set of valid values.  If so, in order
    to detect programs that are not standard conforming, a helpful
    processor should announce an error in this circumstance, which
    requires producing a value that is a member of the set of valid
    values, and comparing it to the proposed result value instead of
    using it as the result value.  One might argue that 13.7.1 was
    aimed, for example, at SQRT(-1.0), for which the mathematical
    function approximated by the intrinsic function has no values that
    are representable by the type and kind of the result.  But it
    doesn't say so, and that argument does not reasonably apply to
    REAL.  Since 13.7.138p5 Case (i) explicitly says that REAL produces
    an approximation to its argument, it is more reasonable for
    REAL(3.14159265358979323846264338d0,kind(1.0e0)) to produce an
    approximation that is a member of the set of valid values for the
    kind of the result, than for its invocation to be prohibited, or for
    it to produce a result that is not a member of the set of valid
    values for the kind of the result.

    If a processor absolutely must reduce REAL with a real argument to
    the identity operation under certain circumstances, a command-line
    argument to cause this behavior could be provided, with a caveat
    that using that setting admits behavior that is not consistent with
    the standard.

Well no.  Inter-statement optimisation is alive and well (re, in spite
of F90/000001: some vendors have to compete on SPEC benchmarks and the
like!), and the people moaning about the REAL() intrinsic not doing
what they want frequently also want the optimisation cranked up to that
level. In that case, VOLATILE is something that does, in fact, work.

One might plausibly argue that we are being more helpful here than we

Many compilers have many bugs in many areas, and volatile is no

TITLE: Functions returning procedure pointers
KEYWORDS: procedure pointer
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 3

QUESTION:

(1) Is a function permitted to return a procedure pointer?
    Much of the language talks about the function result variable,
    but a procedure pointer is not a variable.  For example, 2.2.3
    says [12:16]
       "The VARIABLE that returns the value of a function is called
        the RESULT VARIABLE."
    (emphasis mine); which indicates that the value of a function is
    returned in a variable.

(2) Where may a function reference that returns a procedure pointer
    appear?  In particular,
    (a) as a <selector> in a SELECT TYPE or an ASSOCIATE statement;
    (b) within parentheses as a primary;
    (c) as the argument to an intrinsic inquiry function such as
        KIND or LEN.

(3) [12:18-19] says
      "a subroutine may be used to change the program state by
       changing the values of any of the data objects accessible
       to the subroutine".
    A procedure pointer is not a data object, so is this meant to
    imply that a subroutine is not permitted to change the state of a
    procedure pointer?  Similar text for functions appears in the same
    paragraph.

ANSWER:

(1) Yes, a function is permitted to return a procedure pointer; the
     text calling this a variable is in error.  Edits are supplied to
     correct these mistakes.

(2) It was intended that a function reference that returns a
     procedure pointer only be permitted as an argument to the
     ASSOCIATED and NULL intrinsic functions and in places where an
     ordinary procedure name would be acceptable.  Parentheses around
     a pointer act to dereference the pointer and return a copy of the
     value: this action is inapplicable to procedures. Thus the
     answers to the specific sub-questions are No, No, and No again.
     Clarifying edits are provided.

(3) No, this implication is not intended.  A clarifying edit is
    provided.

NUMBER: F08/0029
TITLE: G0 edit descriptor and floating-point output
KEYWORDS: G edit descriptor, 0 width
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

For data types other than floating-point, the effect of the G0 edit
descriptor is precisely defined.  For floating-point output, the
effect is precisely defined only if the value is an IEEE NaN or
Infinity, the result is otherwise left up to the processor to select
"reasonable" values for w, e, and d (if d is unspecified).

The standard states [258:7-9 10.7.5.2.2p2]:

      "the G0 and G0.d edit descriptors follow the rules for the
       Gw.dEe edit descriptor, except that any leading or trailing
       blanks are removed".

One might deduce from the wording of this that there is no upper limit
on the choice of w, since the production of additional leading (or
trailing) blanks has no effect on the output.

Q1. Is a value for w or e that results in the field being filled with
    asterisks reasonable?  This is not, after all, an error condition.

Q2. Is a value for d that results in significant loss of precision
    reasonable?  E.g. d==1, or for a less extreme example,
    d==PRECISION(value)/2.

Q3. Is a value for d that produces many more digits than the precision
    reasonable?  E.g. d==1000000.  Or, for a less extreme example,
    d==PRECISION(quad) with a single precision value.

Q4. Is a value for e that produces many more digits in the exponent
    than the exponent range reasonable?  E.g. e==1000000.

Q5. If the standard cannot tell me what "reasonable" means, what
    purpose does it serve for it to say that it must be reasonable?
    I cannot see how to tell whether a processor conforms to the
    standard in this respect.

DISCUSSION:

The standard permits, but does not require, the "best" values of w, d
or e to be chosen for each internal value.

ANSWER:

A1. No, that is not reasonable.  An edit is supplied to clarify the
    meaning of "reasonable".

A2. No, a value of d that results in a significant loss of precision
    is not reasonable.  An edit is supplied to correct this.

A3. No, it is not reasonable for d to be ridiculously large.
    An edit is supplied to clarify the intent.

A4. No, e should not be bigger than that required to represent the
    largest finite machine-representable number.  An edit is
    supplied to specify this.

A5. Yes, the use of the word "reasonable" in this context is entirely
    meaningless.  An edit is supplied to remove this misleading
    terminology.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

In 10.7.5.2.2, paragraph 2:

[258:9] In 10.7.5.2.2p2 last sentence:
  "Reasonable processor-dependent" -> "Processor-dependent".
{A5.}

[258:10] In 7.5.2.2p2 last sentence, after "value" insert
  ", that do not result in the field being filled with asterisks".
{A1.}

[258:10] Append new sentences to 10.7.5.2.2p2:
  "The value of <d> shall not result in the production of an output
   value that differs from the internal value by more than
   100*SPACING(value), and shall not be more than two larger than the
   maximum number of digits that might be required to distinguish
   between two different machine numbers of the kind of the internal
   value.  The value of <e> shall not be so large that the exponent
   would have a leading zero both when the internal value is the
   largest finite machine number and when it is the smallest finite
   machine number of that kind."
{The first sentence limits the choice of <d> to lose no more than 2
 digits of precision (A2) and to have no more than 2 spurious digits
 of  precision (A3); for some floating-point formats, the upper bound
 is not strong, being d <= 2+MAX(PRECISION(value)+2,RANGE(value)*2).
 The second sentence would allow e==4 for a lop-sided exponent range,
 e.g. -1100 to +900, but would limit e to at most 3 if the exponent
 range is e.g. -308 to +308 (A4).
 Neither of these restrictions prevent a processor from producing
 fewer mantissa or exponent digits for particular values if that does
 not result in serious loss of accuracy.}

F08/0029
Corbett NO vote:
I agree that the word "reasonable" should not appear in the
Fortran standard.  The first two proposed edits should be
incorporated.  The third edit should not be adopted.

I object to the third edit on general grounds.  The issues dealt
with in the third edit should be matters of "quality of
implementation."  I see no reason for the Fortran standard to
restrict implementors' choices in this area.

I also object to the third edit on specific grounds.  The
proposed edit makes no provision for nonzero scale factors.  If
a nonzero scale factor is in effect, an implementation might
reasonably choose a value of d that is outside the range
specified by the edit, if only to avoid the scale factor being
outside the allowed range of values.

The phrase
    and shall not be no more than two larger than the
    maximum number of digits that might be required to
    distinguish between       two different machine
    numbers of the kind of the internal value.
should say either "any" between "between" and "two",
or should say "all pairs of" instead of "two."

NUMBER: F08/0041
TITLE:  Segment ordering rules
KEYWORDS: segment, allocation
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

(1) Was it intended to allow the allocation of a variable that is not
    a subobject of a coarray to be unordered with respect to its
    definition by another image through a pointer component of a
    coarray?

For example,

  PROGRAM example1
    TYPE t1
      REAL,ALLOCATABLE :: c(:)
    END TYPE
    TYPE t2
      TYPE(t1),POINTER :: p
    END TYPE
    TYPE(t1),TARGET :: x
    TYPE(t2) :: y[*]
    y%p => x                         ! y[n]%p => x[n] for all n.
    SYNC ALL
    IF (THIS_IMAGE()==1) THEN
      ALLOCATE(x%c(1000))            ! Allocates x[1]%c.
    ELSE
      y[1]%p%c(THIS_IMAGE()) = 999   ! Defines some part of x[1]%c.
    END IF
  END PROGRAM

(2) If a variable is already defined (initially or by some segment
    that precedes all other segments in this question), may one image
    reference it while another image causes it to become undefined in
    unordered segments?

For example, is

  PROGRAM example2
    REAL :: x(100)[*]
    x = 1
    SYNC ALL
    IF (THIS_IMAGE()==1) THEN
      PRINT *,SUM(x)
    ELSE
      CALL destroy(x)
    END IF
  CONTAINS
    SUBROUTINE destroy(x)
      REAL,INTENT(OUT) :: x(:)
    END SUBROUTINE
  END PROGRAM

standard-conforming?  This does not appear to violate any of the
segment ordering requirements in 8.5.2 because it is not defined in
any unordered segment (so bullet 1 does not apply), there is no
allocation or pointer association status (so bullet 2 does not apply),
and there is no dummy argument being defined (so bullet 3 does not
apply).

ANSWER:

(1) No, this example violates the requirement of the first bullet in
    paragraph 3 of 8.5.2, which says:
      "if a variable is defined on an image in a segment, it shall not
       be referenced, defined, or become undefined in a segment on
       another image unless the segments are ordered".
    x[1]%c is defined in segment 2 by images 2-N, but is made
    undefined on image 1 (allocation makes a variable undefined except
    when default initialization occurs).

(2) No, this example was not intended to be standard-conforming.  An
    edit is supplied to clarify the intent.

EDITS to 10-007:

[189:14] In 8.5.2 paragraph 3, first bullet point,

** start negative comments
  John Reid's NO vote on F08/0041:

    There are errors in both examples. In example (1), the component of
    type t2 should have type t1. In example (2), the PRINT statement
    should reference x on another image, e.g. PRINT *, x(1)[2].

    More seriously, the edit proposed in 10-201 has been removed. While
    it is not necessary for allocation, it is needed for pointer
    association.  This means that it is desirable to rewrite the
    questions and answers.  Here is my suggestion

    QUESTION:

    (1) If a variable is already defined (initially or by some segment
        that precedes all other segments in this question), may one
        image reference it while another image causes it to become
        undefined in unordered segments?

    For example, is

      PROGRAM example2
        REAL :: x(100)[*]
        x = 1
        SYNC ALL
        IF (THIS_IMAGE()==1) THEN
          PRINT *,x(1)[2]
        ELSE
          CALL destroy(x)
        END IF
      CONTAINS
        SUBROUTINE destroy(x)
          REAL,INTENT(OUT) :: x(:)
        END SUBROUTINE
      END PROGRAM

    standard-conforming?  This does not appear to violate any of the
    segment ordering requirements in 8.5.2 because it is not defined in
    any unordered segment (so bullet 1 does not apply), there is no
    allocation or pointer association status (so bullet 2 does not
    apply), and there is no dummy argument being defined (so bullet 3
    does not apply).

    (2) Was it intended to allow a pointer assignment to a pointer that
        is not a subobject of a coarray to be unordered with respect to
        its definition by another image through a pointer component of
        a coarray?

    For example,

      PROGRAM example1
        TYPE t
          REAL,POINTER :: p
        END TYPE
        REAL,TARGET :: a=0.0, b=1.0
        TYPE(t) :: y[*]
        y%p => a                         ! y[n]%p => a for all n.
        SYNC ALL
        IF (THIS_IMAGE()==1) THEN
          y%p => b                       ! y[1]%p => b
        ELSE
          y[1]%p = 999                   ! Defines a[1] or b[1]?
        END IF
      END PROGRAM

    (1) No. This case has been overlooked in the segment ordering rules.
        An edit is supplied to correct this.

        rules.   An edit is supplied to correct this.

  Van Snyder's No vote on F08/0041:

    "is defined" is a static concept.  The requirement should
     always have been "becomes defined".  Therefore the edit should
     be to replace "variable is defined" to "variable becomes
     defined or undefined" -- or do we need another interp to
     repair this?

  Jim Xia's No vote on F08/0041:

    The first example should be fixed to have t2 contains a pointer
    component of type t1.  The second example is perfectly legal.  Seems
    we need to rework on this interp.

  result of ballot on F08/0041:

    In example (1), the component of type t2 is changed to type t1.
    However, more work is needed on this interp as a result of these
    comments => F08/0041 fails.

TITLE:  constraints on entities of type LOCK_TYPE
KEYWORDS: lock, polymorphism

STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

  Program example
    Use Iso_Fortran_Env, Only:lock_type
    type :: m
      class(*), allocatable :: lock
    end type
    type(m) :: om[*]
    allocate(lock_type :: om%lock)
    call inner(om)                  ! Problem call.
  Contains
    Subroutine inner(omm)
      Type(m),Intent(Out) :: omm
      Print *,Allocated(omm%lock)
    End Subroutine
  End Program

Constraint C1304 attempts to prohibit a variable with a LOCK_TYPE
subobject from appearing in a variable definition context, such as the
call to inner, but the dynamic type of om%lock cannot be determined
statically.

Is this program standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

The example was not intended to be standard-conforming.  An ALLOCATE
statement with a <type-spec> should not have been permitted to add
components of type LOCK_TYPE; an edit is supplied to correct this
error.

QUESTION:

Consider

    REAL,TARGET :: x(100) = [ (i,i=1,100) ]
    REAL,POINTER :: p(:)
    TYPE t
      REAL,POINTER :: q(:)

    y = t(x( [ 1,4,9,25 ] ))   ! (4)
    PRINT *,y%q
  END PROGRAM

The pointer assignment statement at (1) associates P with X.
The intrinsic assignment statement at (2) includes the effect of
pointer assignment of X to Y%Q, but is not a pointer assignment
statement.

The pointer assignment statement at (3) is not standard-conforming
according to 6.5.3.3.2 paragraph 2:
  "An array section with a vector subscript shall not be
   ... the <data-target> in a pointer assignment statement"

However, the intrinsic assignment statement at (4) is not subject to
this requirement as it is not a pointer assignment statement.

Note that the quoted paragraph is entirely  duplicative, as in:
 - the first bullet item is covered by 12.5.2.4p18,
 - the second bullet item is covered by C724 in 7.2.2.2
   (but C724 does not cover this case either),
 - the third bullet item is covered by C901 in 9.5.1.
Editorial improvements have been made in corrigendum 1.  The entire
paragraph has been rewritten.

Q1. Was the statement marked (4) intended to be allowed?

Q2. If not, was it intended to be prohibited by a constraint like
    C724, or was it intended to be a simple requirement?
    (Editorial note: in any case surely the requirement should appear
    in the pointer assignment subclause.)

ANSWER:

A1. No, this was not intended.  An edit is supplied to correct this.

A2. Constraint C724 was intended to cover this case.  An edit is
    supplied to correct this.

EDIT:

[158:19-20] In 7.2.2.2 Syntax of the pointer assignment statement,
            C724, change ""(R737) A <variable>"
            to "A variable that is a pointer target",
            making the whole constraint read:
  "A variable that is a pointer target shall have either the TARGET
   or POINTER attribute, and shall not be an array section with a

QUESTION:

(1) Consider the following

  module Funcs

    interface operator ( .op. )
      module procedure Unary, Binary
    end interface

  contains

    function Unary ( Arg )
      integer, intent(in) :: Arg
      integer, pointer :: Unary
    ...
    end function Unary

    function Binary ( Arg1, Arg2 )
      integer, intent(in) :: Arg1, Arg2
      integer, pointer :: Binary
    ...
    end function Binary

  end module Funcs

  program What

    use Funcs
    integer :: X, Y = 42

    10 .op. x = y

  end program What

Is the "10" in "10 .op. x = y" an operand, and therefore an argument of
a reference to Binary, or is .op. a reference to Unary and "10" a
statement label?

(2) Consider the following

  module Funcs

    interface operator ( .op. )
      module procedure Unary, Binary
    end interface

  contains

    function Unary ( Arg )
      integer, intent(in) :: Arg

    ...
    end function Binary

  end module Funcs

  program What

    use Funcs
    integer :: X = 42, Y

    read (10) .op. x, y

  end program What

Is "10" an <io-control-spec-list>, or is "(10) .op. x" a <format>?

Note that this program is valid Fortran 90, and "(10) .op. x" is
a <format> according to the Fortran 90 standard.

ANSWER:

It was an oversight that the programs in (1) and (2) conform to the
syntax and constraints in two different ways.

The problem stems from the over-ambitious extension of allowing
pointer function references to denote variables; this was unambiguous
for <function-reference> syntax, but is not for operator syntax.
Also, operator syntax has other restrictions on it that are intended
to prevent modification of an operand, and these are subverted if the
result is treated as a variable.

Edits are supplied to remove the treatment of pointer-valued operators

QUESTION:

Consider the following

  module Funcs

    interface operator ( .op. )
      module procedure Unary, Binary
    end interface

  contains

    function Unary ( Arg )
      integer, intent(in) :: Arg
      character(len=...), pointer :: Unary
    ...
    end function Unary

    function Binary ( Arg1, Arg2 )
      integer, intent(in) :: Arg1, Arg2
      character(len=...), pointer :: Binary
    ...
    end function Binary

  end module Funcs

  program What

    use Funcs
    integer :: X = 42, Y

    read (10) .op. x, y

  end program What

Is "10" an <io-control-spec-list>, or is "(10) .op. x" a <format>?

Note that this program is valid Fortran 90, and "(10) .op. x" is
a <format> according to the Fortran 90 standard.

  An edit is supplied
to remove the ambiguity in the current standard.

ANSWER:

This is another example of the same problem as F08/0075, viz syntactic
ambiguity caused by the F2008 feature "operator syntax for variable
denotation".  Therefore this interpretation request is subsumed by
F08/0075.

TITLE: Pointer arguments to PURE functions
KEYWORDS: PURE function, POINTER, INTENT(IN)
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 3

QUESTION:

 Consider the following subprogram:

   Real Pure Function F( X )
     Real,Pointer :: X
     Real :: F
     f = 1.0
     x = 2.0    ! (A)
     Nullify(x) ! (B)
   End Function F

 This subprogram does not conform to Fortran 2003, because both
 statements (A) and (B) violate constraint C1272 which says
   "C1272 In a pure subprogram any designator with a base object that
          ... is a dummy argument of a pure function ... shall not be
          used ... [in] a variable definition context ...".

However, the corresponding constraint in Fortran 2008, C1283, is
missing the condition that applies the constraint to a dummy
argument of a pure function, except when it has INTENT(IN).  Thus
the statements marked (A) and (B) do not violate C1283, and
therefore this subprogram appears to conform to Fortran 2008.

Was this subprogram intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

No, this subprogram was not intended to be standard-conforming.
An edit is supplied to re-insert the omitted condition.

NUMBER: F08/0085
TITLE: Problems with PARAMETERs
KEYWORDS: PARAMETER
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 3

QUESTION:

(1) Consider the program fragment

    Subroutine s
      Parameter (n=1)
      Integer :: x,n       !(A)
      Parameter (x=3)

    The type declaration statement marked "!(A)", declares the
    entities X and N to be of type INTEGER.  Furthermore, as we see by
    the immediately preceding and following PARAMETER statements, both
    X and N are named constants.

    Unfortunately, a constraint says
      C507 (R503) "An <initialization> shall appear if the entity is a
                   named constant (5.3.13)."
    (BTW, R503 is <entity-decl>.)

    Therefore one concludes that the type declaration statement marked
    "!(A)" is not conforming as it violates C507 for both X and N.

    Is this statement intended to be conforming?

(2) Firstly, consider

    Subroutine s2(n)
      Integer,Parameter :: x(n:n+1) = [ 1,2 ]
      Character(n),Parameter :: y = 'abc'
      ...

    The type declaration statements are not conforming because
    according to 5.2.2p1, X and Y are automatic data objects, and C506
    says that <initialization> shall not appear in that case.

    Now consider

    Subroutine s2b(n)
      Implicit Character(n) (a-z)
      Parameter (y = 'abc')
      Integer :: x(n:n+1)
      Parameter(x=[1,2])

    This is not valid Fortran 2003, because 5.2 contains the
    requirement:
      "The combination of attributes that may be specified for a
       particular entity is subject to the same restrictions as for
       type declaration statements regardless of the method of
       specification.  This also applies to PROCEDURE, EXTERNAL, and
       INTRINSIC statements."

    This requirement does not appear in F2008.  However, there is no
    indication in the Introduction of this new feature.

    Is this extension to Fortran 2003 deliberate?

ANSWER:

(1) Yes, the type declaration statement was intended to be allowed.
    An edit is supplied to correct this mistake.

(2) No, the omission of this requirement was inadvertent.  An edit
    is supplied to correct this mistake.

[88:14] In 5.2.1, Replace constraint "C507 (503)" completely with

TITLE:  Implied-shape and separate PARAMETER statement
KEYWORDS: Implied-shape, PARAMETER
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 3

QUESTION:

Q1.  Consider

  Program test1
    Character(*) a,b(*)
    Dimension c(*)
    Parameter (a='123', b=['1','2','3'])
    Character(*),Parameter :: c = [ '44','55','66' ]
    Print *,a,b,c
  End

The definition of the assumed-length character named constant A
conforms to Fortran 77 to Fortran 2008.  However, the definition of
the implied-shape named constant B appears not to conform to Fortran
2008, as the standard says in 5.4.11p2
  "A named array constant defined by a PARAMETER statement shall have
   its shape specified in a prior specification statement."
On the other hand, the named constant C does not have such a
requirement, so its definition would appear to be conforming.

This apparent requirement on the named constant B would thus appear to
be inconsistent with those on the named constant C, as well as
inconsistent with the way that assumed length works, and with the
general principle of allowing attributes to be specified either in a
single type declaration statement or with separate specification
statements.

Is the program intended to conform to the Fortran standard?

Q2. Consider

  Subroutine test2(a)
    Real,Dimension(*) :: a,c
    Parameter (c = [ 45.6 ])
    a(:size(c)) = c
  End Subroutine

The <array-spec> in the type declaration statement is ambiguous; if it
is an <implied-shape-spec> then the declaration of A as an
assumed-size array is erroneous, but if it is an <assumed-size-spec>
then the declaration of C as an implied-shape array is erroneous.

Is this program-unit intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

A1. Yes, the program was intended to conform to the Fortran standard.
    An edit is provided to modify the requirement for prior
    specification so as to allow this case.

A2. Yes, the program is intended to conform to the Fortran standard.
    An edit is provided to add syntax to permit this unambiguously.

QUESTION:

For a processor that supports both ASCII and ISO 10646 UCS-4
character kinds, assuming without loss of generality that
Selected_Char_Kind('ASCII') is equal to 1 and that
Selected_Char_Kind('ISO_10646') is equal to 10646,
consider the following program:

  Module charkinds
    Integer,Parameter :: ascii = 1
    Integer,Parameter :: ucs4 = 10646
  End Module
  Module overload
    Use charkinds
    Interface Assignment(=)

    Subroutine char_asg(a,b)

      Do i=1,Min(Len(a),Len(b))
        a(i:i) = Achar(Mod(Iachar(b(i:i))+1,127))

  End Module
  Program test
    Use overload
    Character(10,ascii) x
    x = ucs4_'Hello'

  End Program

This program conforms to Fortran 95, which permitted user-defined
assignment between all characters with different kinds.

However, Fortran 2008 provides intrinsic assignment between
ISO 10646 characters and ASCII characters, so user-defined assignment
is not permitted (12.4.3.4.3 and Table 7.8).

Thus there seems to be a contradiction between the Fortran 95
compatibility description in 1.6.3 and 12.4.3.4.3.

Is the program intended to conform to Fortran 2008?
And if it does, does it print
 "Hello     "
(intrinsic assignment)
 "Ifmmp*****"
(user-defined assignment)?

The program was not intended to conform to the standard.

QUESTION:

On comp.lang.fortran Ian Harvey brought up a pointer/PURE
question.

Given a type definition like

 type :: int_ptr
    integer, pointer :: i
 end type int_ptr

And a PURE function like

  PURE function FUN (arg)
    type(int_ptr), intent(in) :: arg
    type(int_ptr), allocatable :: tmp
    FUN = 1
    allocate (tmp, source=arg)
    tmp%i = 2
  end function fun

Is FUN standard conforming?

Doesn't the use of source=arg allow the function to modify a global
entity via the tmp%i = ...?  There don't seem to be any constraints on
what arg%i can point to, which means that the assignment to tmp%i can
have side effects.

Note that C1283(1) prevents usage like
    arg%i = 2

This was not intended to be standard-conforming.

STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Questions 1-3 use this module:

  Module m200c2
    Integer,Target :: x = 42
  Contains
    Function fx()
      Integer,Pointer :: fx
      fx => x
    End Function
  End Module

Q1. Consider this main program

  Program q1
    Use m200c2
    Call test(x,fx())                  ! The call.
  Contains
    Subroutine test(a,b)
      Integer :: a,b
      a = a*10                         ! The assignment.
      Print *,a,b
    End Subroutine
  End Program

According to Fortran 2003, "fx()" in the CALL statement is an
expression and not a variable, and has the value 42.  It follows
that the assignment "a = a*10" is standard-conforming and does
not affect the value of B.  Therefore this program prints
 420 42

However, according to Fortran 2008, "fx()" in the CALL statement is a
variable, and therefore the assignment does not conform to the
standard because it affects the value of B and so violates 12.5.2.13
item (3) which requires all updates to B to go through the dummy
argument, and therefore the behaviour of the program is unspecified.

This conflicts with the statement in clause 1 that all Fortran 2003
programs remain conforming in Fortran 2008.

Is this program intended to remain standard-conforming?

Q2. Consider this main program

  Program q2
    Use m200c2
    Call test(x,fx())                  ! The call.
  Contains
    Subroutine test(a,b)
      Integer,Target :: a,b
      a = a*10                         ! The assignment.
      Print *,a,b
    End Subroutine
  End Program

According to Fortran 2003, "fx()" in the CALL statement is an
expression and not a variable, and has the value 42.  It follows
that the assignment "a = a*10" is standard-conforming and does
not affect the value of B.  Therefore this program prints
 420 42

However, according to Fortran 2008, "fx()" in the CALL statement is a
variable, and therefore the assignment to A affects the value of B, so
the program will print
 420 420

This apparently conflicts with the statement in clause 1 that Fortran
2008 is an upwards compatible extension to Fortran 2003.

Is this program intended to have altered semantics?

Q3. Consider this main program

  Program q3
    Use m200c2
    Associate(y=>fx())   ! The association.
      x = 0              ! The assignment.
      Print *,x,y
    End Associate
  End Program

This main program apparently conforms to both Fortran 2003 and Fortran
2008, but according to Fortran 2003 "fx()" in the association is an
expression, evaluated on entry to the construct, and therefore Y
becomes associated with the value 42, and therefore the program prints
the values (spacing may differ)

 0 42

whereas according to Fortran 2008 "fx()" in the association is a
variable, and every reference to Y is a reference to the associated
variable, so the assignment also changes the value of Y and therefore
the program prints the values

 0 0

This apparently conflicts with the statement in clause 1 that Fortran
2008 is an upwards compatible extension to Fortran 2003.

Is this program intended to have altered semantics?

Q4. Consider this program

  Module m200c2_q4
    Integer,Target :: x = 42
  Contains
    Function fx()
      Class(*),Pointer :: fx
      fx => x
    End Function
  End Module
  Program q4
    Use m200c2_q4
    Select Type (q=>fx())
    Type Is (Integer)
      x = 0
      Print *,x,q
    End Select
  End Program

Using the same logic as Q2, this should print the values
 0 42
in Fortran 2003, but the values
 0 0
in Fortran 2008.

Again, this is not upwards compatible with Fortran 2003.

-----------------------
From N1990: F08/0089

Corbett reason for NO vote

Questions Q1 and Q2 assume that if a pointer actual argument
has the form of an expression and the corresponding dummy
argument is a nonpointer dummy argument without the VALUE
attribute, the dummy argument becomes argument associated
with the value of the target of the value of the pointer
actual argument.  On the newsgroup comp.lang.fortran, Ian
Harvey pointed out that the Fortran standards do not support
that premise.  Paragraph 2 of Clause 12.5.2.3 of the
Fortran 2008 standard states

     If a nonpointer dummy argument without the VALUE
     attribute corresponds to a pointer actual argument
     that is pointer associated with a target, the
     dummy argument becomes argument associated with
     that target.

Paragraph 8 of Clause 12.4.1.2 of the Fortran 2003 standard
states

     Except in references to intrinsic inquiry functions,
     if the dummy argument is not a pointer and the
     corresponding actual argument is a pointer, the
     actual argument shall be associated with a target
     and the dummy argument becomes argument associated
     with that target.

Paragraph 6 of Clause 12.4.1.1 of the Fortran 95 standard
states

     If the dummy argument is not a pointer and the
     corresponding actual argument is a pointer, the
     actual argument shall be currently associated
     with a target and the dummy argument becomes
     argument associated with that target

The paragraph added between paragraphs 3 and 4 of
Clause 12.4.1.1 of the Fortran 90 standard by
Corrigendum 2 states

     If the dummy argument is not a pointer and the
     corresponding actual argument is, the actual
     argument must be currently associated with a
     target and the dummy argument becomes argument
     associated with that target.

That text was added as a result of interpretation
F90/000039.

In the examples given in questions Q1 and Q2, the
actual argument fx() is a pointer actual argument
corresponding to a nonpointer dummy argument.
Therefore, the dummy argument becomes argument
associated with the target of the pointer actual
argument, which is the module variable x.  The dummy
argument does not become argument associated with the
value of the target of the pointer.  Thus, there is
no semantic difference between Fortran 2008 and the
previous standards in this regard.

The answers and edits given for questions Q1 and Q2 are
based on the same premise as the questions themselves
and should be rejected.

I asked people to compile and run the example programs
given in questions Q1 and Q2 and variations of them
using a variety of compilers.  In most, but not all,
cases, the results were consistent with the semantics
stated in the Fortran standards, not with the semantics
assumed by questions Q1 and Q2.

Questions Q3 and Q4 are consistent with the standards,
as are the corresponding answers and edits, but I do not
care for the nature of the changes that will result if
interpretation F08/0075 is passed.  I think changing the
language so that the form of a function reference
determines its meaning is a mistake.

Long comment:

Twice in the edits appears "...a <function-reference> to a
pointer function is regarded as a variable...". Should this
be a "data pointer function"?

Snyder comment:

The term "pointer function" is not used as a noun,
although "nonpointer function" is so used at [454:36].
I have a slight preference that "pointer function" in
the edit for [24:11+] be replaced by "function that
returns a pointer result" in both paragraphs.  The
same change ought to be made in the edits for [24:27+]
and [25:6+]

A parallel change ought to be made at [454:36], but
that can be done editorially rather than within this
interpretration.

NUMBER: F08/0090
TITLE: 	What restrictions apply to initialization and PARAMETER?
KEYWORDS: PARAMETER, initialization, conformable, type conversion
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 3

QUESTION:

Consider the programs

  Program m200c3_1
    Integer :: a(10,10)
    Parameter (a = [ (i,i=1,100) ] )
    Print *,a
  End Program

  Program m200c3_2
    Parameter (b = 'ok')
    Print *,b
  End Program

  Program m200c3_3
    Integer :: x(23) = [ 1 ]
    Print *,x
  End Program

  Program m200c3_4
    Integer :: y = 'ok'
    Print *,y
  End Program

The PARAMETER statement for the named constant A has an expression
whose shape does not conform with that of A.  The PARAMETER statement
for the named constant B has an expression whose type does not conform
to that of B.  The <initialization> for X is not conformable in shape.
The <initialization> for Y is not conformable in type.

There appears to be no requirement either for shape or type
conformance, in Fortran 2008 or in previous Fortran standards, except
for initializing data pointers.

Q1. Do any of these programs conform to Fortran 2008?

Q2. If there is meant to be a requirement for the shapes to conform or
    for the types to be convertible, should this not be a constraint?

ANSWER:

A1. No, these programs do not conform to Fortran 2008, as no
    interpretation is established for any of them.  Edits are
    provided to clarify this.

A2. This is not a constraint.  A future revision of Fortran might
    choose to mandate diagnosis of these errors.

EDIT to 10-007r1:

[88:30+] 5.2.1 Syntax, Insert new paragraph at end of subclause
  "If <initialization> appears for a nonpointer entity,
   - its type and type parameters shall conform as specified for
     intrinsic assignment (7.2.1.2);
   - if the entity has implied shape, the rank of <initialization>
     shall be the same as the rank of the entity;
   - if the entity does not have implied shape, <initialization> shall
     either be scalar or have the same shape as the entity.".

  "The constant expression that corresponds to a named constant shall
   have type and type parameters that conform with the named constant
   as specified for intrinsic assignment (7.2.1.2).  If the named

QUESTION:

Q1. Consider

  Program m7_1
  Type empty
  End Type
  Type(empty),Target :: x
  Type(empty),Pointer :: y
  y => x
  Print *,Associated(y,x)
  End

Is this program standard-conforming, and does it print T or F?

According to 16.5.3.2p2,
  item 1  is default integer etc, N/A
  item 2 is double precision etc, N/A
  item 3 is default character, N/A
  item 4 is C character, N/A
  item 5 is SEQUENCE type, N/A

According to item (6),
  "a nonpointer scalar object of any type not specified in items
   (1)-(5) occupies a single unspecified storage unit that is
   different [from everything else]"

If that analysis is correct, X occupies a single unspecified storage
unit, not zero storage units, and therefore T should be printed.

Q2. Consider

  Program m7_2
  Type sempty
    Sequence
  End Type
  Type(sempty),Target :: x
  Type(sempty),Pointer :: y
  y => x
  Print *,Associated(y,x)
  End

Is this program standard-conforming, and does it print T or F?

Now X falls into item 5, which makes it a "sequence of storage
sequences corresponding to the sequence of its ultimate components";
there are no ultimate components, this makes it a zero-sized storage
sequence and therefore F should be printed.

This does not seem to be consistent with the apparent answer to Q1.

Q3. Consider

  Program m7_3
  Type numeric_empty
    Sequence
  End Type
  Type character_empty
    Sequence
  End Type
  Type(numeric_empty) a
  Integer b
  Character c
  Type(character_empty) d
  Equivalence(a,b)             ! E1.
  Equivalence(c,d)             ! E2.
  End

Is this program conforming?

According to the definitions in 4.5.2.3, NUMERIC_EMPTY is a numeric
sequence type and therefore one might expect to be able to EQUIVALENCE
it to an INTEGER.  Similarly, CHARACTER_EMPTY is a character sequence
type and therefore one might expect to be able to EQUIVALENCE it to a
CHARACTER.

However, NUMERIC_EMPTY is clearly also a character sequence type, and
therefore statement E1 violates C592 because B is not character or
character sequence.

Similarly, CHARACTER_EMPTY is clearly also a numeric sequence type,
and therefore statement E2 violates C591.

It seems very strange to have a type that is simultaneously numeric
and character sequence type.

Q4. Consider

  Program m7_4
  Type numeric_empty_2
    Sequence
    Real c(0)
  End Type
  Type character_empty_2
    Sequence
    Character(0) c
  End Type
  Type(numeric_empty_2) a
  Integer b
  Character c
  Type(character_empty_2) d
  Equivalence(a,b)             ! E3.
  Equivalence(c,d)             ! E4.
  End

Does this program conform?

According to the definitions in 4.5.2.3, NUMERIC_EMPTY_2 is a numeric
sequence type and not a character sequence type, and conversely
CHARACTER_EMPTY_2 is a character sequence type and not a numeric
sequence type, and therefore the constraints for the statements at E3
and E4 are not violated.

Thus this appears to be conforming, in contradiction to the example in
Q3, even though the storage sequence of NUMERIC_EMPTY,
NUMERIC_EMPTY_2, CHARACTER_EMPTY, and CHARACTER_EMPTY_2 are all the
same.

This does not look very consistent with the situation in Q3.

ANSWER:

A1.  The program is conforming and prints T.

A2.  The program was not intended to conform; SEQUENCE makes no sense
     when there are no components.  An edit is needed to correct this.

A3.  The program does not conform as a sequence type must have at
     least one component.

A4.  The program is conforming.  The apparent design inconsistency is
     not an error in the standard.

EDIT to 10-007r1:

[62:19] 4.5.2.3, in constraint C436
        After "appears," insert "the type shall have at least one

TITLE: Process exit status and error termination
KEYWORD: ERROR STOP
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 3

QUESTION:

Many operating systems today (e.g. Posix-related ones) use a process
exit status of zero to indicate successful execution, whereas nonzero
indicates an error.  (Occasionally nonzero values, e.g. 1, also
indicate success.)

Fortran STOP and ERROR STOP with an integer <stop-code> are
recommended to use the <stop-code> as the exit status.  The STOP
statement without an integer <stop-code> is recommended to have an
exit status of zero; this conforms to common practice since STOP
initiates normal termination.

The standard is silent on the effect of error termination, except in
the case of an ERROR STOP (sans integer <stop-code>) which is
unexpectedly recommended to also return an exit status of zero.

Q1. Is this intentional?  Should the exit code for ERROR STOP not have
    been recommended to be nonzero?

Q2. Should the recommendation for an ERROR STOP not also apply to
    error termination by other causes?

ANSWER:

A1. It was not intended to recommend returning "success" for error
    termination.  An edit is supplied to correct this.

A2. Yes, the recommendation for an ERROR STOP without an integer
    <stop-code> should also apply to other means of standard-defined
    error termination.  An edit is supplied to correct this omission.

Q1. Consider

  Subroutine s1(a)

Does this program unit conform to the standard?
7.1.12 item (4) permits
  "a specification inquiry where each designator or function argument
   is ...
     (b) a variable whose properties inquired about are not

        (ii) deferred, or
        (iii) defined by an expression that is not a constant

PRESENT is a specification inquiry (because it is an intrinsic inquiry
function), and the standard does not say that the "presence" of an
optional dummy argument is an assumed or deferred attribute, and it
does not appear to be "defined by an expression" either.

On the other hand, the standard does not say anything about what kind
of property the presence is.

reasoning as Q1 and Q2, it appears to conform, but if A is absent,
LEN(A) is not permitted by 12.5.2.12.

ANSWER:

A1. Program unit S1 was not intended to conform to the standard.
    An edit is provided to clarify that this is not valid.

A2. Program unit S2 was intended to conform to the standard.
    An edit is provided to clarify that this is valid.

A3. Program unit S3 was not intended to conform to the standard.
    An edit is provided to clarify that this is not valid.

Is this conforming?

Multiple STAT= are prohibited from a <sync-stat-list>, but this is a

No, this was not intended to be conforming.  No specifier was intended

QUESTION:

Is the following subprogram required always to print "T T"?

  subroutine Wobbly ( N )
    integer, volatile :: N
    integer :: A ( n, n )
    integer :: B ( n * n )
    print *, size(a) == size(b), size(a,1) == size(a,2)
  end subroutine Wobbly

ANSWER:

No.

There are three specification expressions in the subroutine, and the
volatile variable N appears in each of them.  Since, being volatile,
the variable N might have a different value each time it is
referenced, these three specification expressions might receive
different values for their references to N.  If that happens, the
array sizes might well be different.

EDITS:

None.

Q1. Does the following program fragment conform to the 2008 standard?

  subroutine S ( P )
    interface
      subroutine Q ( X )
        real, intent(inout) :: X
      end subroutine Q

        import
        procedure (R) :: A
      end subroutine P
    end interface
    procedure (Q) :: R
  end subroutine S

12.4.3.3p2 says "If an entity that is made accessible by this means is
accessed by host association and is defined in the host scoping unit, it
shall be explicitly declared prior to the interface body."

However, although the procedure R is declared in the host scoping unit
it is not defined in the host scoping unit, so this is ineffective.

Q2. If the IMPORT statement were changed to "IMPORT R", would that be
    conforming?

12.4.3.3p1 says
  "An entity that is imported in this manner and is defined in the
   host scoping unit shall be explicitly declared prior to the
   interface body."

Again, procedure R is declared but not defined in the host scoping
unit, so this requirement is ineffective.

These examples were not intended to conform to the Fortran standard.

TITLE: NAMELIST and multiple occurrences of a variable
KEYWORD: NAMELIST
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Consider

  Program p1
    Real :: x = 3, y = 4
    Namelist /n/ x, y
    Write (*,n)
  End Program

According to 5.6,
  "The order in which the variables are specified in the NAMELIST
   statement determines the order in which the values appear on
   output."

However, this stops short of saying that the order is the same, merely
that it determines it.  Perhaps it might be standard-conforming for a
processor to always produce the values in reverse order, for example.
10.11.4 does not seem to address the issue of what the order is.

Q1: Is the order meant to be the same?

Consider

  Program p2
    Real :: x = 3, y = 4
    Namelist /n/ x, y, x
    Write (*,n)
  End Program

This program did not conform to Fortran 90, but does conform to
Fortran 2003 and later.  The Fortran 2008 standard says (5.6p2):

  "The order in which the variables are specified in the NAMELIST
   statement determines the order in which the values appear on
   output."

However, there are only two variables in the NAMELIST statement, X
and Y.  Therefore it seems to be ambiguous whether the output should
be something like
  &N X=3 Y=4 /
or
  &N Y=4 X=3 /

Some compilers produce
  &N X=3 Y=4 X=3 /
but this is not an ordering of the variables X and Y.

Q2. Is this program intended to conform to the standard, and if so,
    what is the intended output?

ANSWER:

A1. Yes, the order is meant to be the same.  An edit is supplied to
    clarify this.

A2. The program was intended to conform to the standard, and the output
    was intended to be the third option.  An edit is supplied to
    correct the text in 5.6.

EDIT:

[111:13-14] 5.6p2, replace entire paragraph with
  "The order in which the values appear on output is the same as the
   order of the <namelist-group-object>s in the namelist group object
   list; if a variable appears more than once as a
   <namelist-group-object> for the same namelist group, its value
   appears once for each occurrence".

According to the standard, the type of the result of MERGE is the same
as the type of TSOURCE.  One might imagine that this means that the
result is polymorphic if and only if TSOURCE is polymorphic.  This
would be a slightly unusual and unexpected asymmetry.

Also, the types of FSOURCE and TSOURCE have to be the same.  If this
means both the declared and dynamic types, one might imagine that this
means that the result is polymorphic if and only if both FSOURCE and
TSOURCE are polymorphic, since otherwise the non-polymorphic argument
decides the type.

On the other hand, if the type requirements are talking about the
declared type only, one might imagine that the result is polymorphic
if either TSOURCE or FSOURCE is polymorphic.

However, in any case there would seem to be an error in the standard,
since the result is specified to be the same as TSOURCE, rather than
the same as whichever argument is chosen to be the result value; if
this refers to the dynamic type, it is contradictory when FSOURCE is
chosen as the result value.  And if it does not refer to the dynamic
type, there appears to be no statement which says what the dynamic
type of the result is.

Q1.  Is the apparent asymmetry between the treatment of TSOURCE and
     FSOURCE intended?

Q2.  Which of the MERGE invocations A-E are polymorphic?

Q3.  When the result of MERGE is polymorphic, are the dynamic types of
     TSOURCE and FSOURCE permitted to be different?  And if they are,
     is the dynamic type of the result the same as the chosen argument
     and not necessarily the same as TSOURCE?

ANSWER:

A1. There is no asymmetry between TSOURCE and FSOURCE, because they
    are required to have the same type and type parameters.  This
    means that both the declared and dynamic types and type parameters
    must be the same.

A2. Only MERGE invocation E is polymorphic.  An edit is provided to
    clarify this.

A3. No, the dynamic types and type parameters are required to be the
    same.

Note that because MERGE is elemental, it needs the type and type
parameters to be the same for both the declared and dynamic types,
otherwise the principle that all elements of an array have the same
(declared and dynamic) type and type parameters would be broken.

EDITS:

[368:26] 13.7.110p4 (Result Characteristics),
         "Same as TSOURCE." ->

          and FSOURCE are required to have the same type and type
          parameters (for both the declared and dynamic types), the
          result is polymorphic if and only if both TSOURCE and
          FSOURCE are polymorphic."

Does this program print all true values?

The procedure pointers are all associated with the internal procedure
INNER, which might lead one to believe that the answer is yes (that
is, they are all associated with the same target), but each procedure
pointer at each nesting level has a different host instance, which
might lead one to believe that the answer is no (and that therefore
only one of each of the 3-element sequences printed will be T).

ANSWER:

No, the program does not print all true values; two procedure pointers
to the "same" internal procedure are only associated if the host
instances are also the same.  An edit is supplied to the standard to
clarify this.
