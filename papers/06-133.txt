where  Y means "yes"
       C       "yes with comment"
       N       "no with comment"

The comments for each interp are attached below in the same order as
the table above.  The summary of DRAFT results is as follows:

    P = passed
    C = passed as amended
    F = further consideration

The interps marked "C" pass with some minor typo fixes, as noted
below.

The interps marked "F" will be reconsidered at J3 meeting #175 by the
/interp committee who will decide if the status becomes "withdraw for
more work", "passed as amended", or "passed as printed".

F03/0059   Structure components in namelist input

  Rich Bleikamp's NO comment for F03/0059:

    The replacement text reads "if the variable would not be processed
    by a UDDTIO ...", but I think the presence of an object designator
    might actually determine whether or not the object designator is
    processed by a UDDTIO routine (sort of the reverse decision
    process than what is being suggested, where being processed by a
    UDDTIO routine precludes the use of a non-simple variable name in
    the input record).

    Second, the sentence immediately after the replaced text talks
    about "Successive qualifications" being applied to the name.  I
    think this reads awkwardly with the suggested edit.

    Third, I think the answer may be wrong.  For namelist input, we
    should allow (perhaps we already do) object designators all the
    time, and just not invoke the UDDTIO routine if the object
    designator is not a simple  variable name, or if the resulting
    objects datatype/shape do not match an existing interface for a
    UDDTIO routine.  Also, its not clear to me (its too late in the
    day), but perhaps we really want to allow an object designator
    that's an array element reference to invoke a UDDTIO routine.
    We could use the datatype and shape of the object designator to
    determine whether or not a UDDTIO routine should be invoked
    (still a compile time decision).  I'm not at all sure we'd want
    to allow component references in such a case, or perhaps a
    component reference in the input record just precludes the 
    possibility of invoking a UDDTIO routine for that input value.

    The tradeoffs here are:

    1) allow some more functionality (which we may already allow),
       such as array element references appearing in a namelist input
       record (as a namelist group object name, possibly qualified),
       and still cause a UDDTIO routine to be invoked, and

    2) keep the rules simple enough that the user and compiler's I/O
      library can easily agree on what's supposed to happen, and
      what input values are therefore allowed.

    I was going to suggest a replacement edit, but my head hurts too
    much :).


  Rob James' YES comment for F03/0059:

    In the input for the program (question 1), "b1" should be "x".

  Conclusion on F03/0059:  Has not yet passed J3 letter ballot #12 -
                           /interp will consider the above comment
                           from Rich Bleikamp at meeting #175;  the
                           correction suggested by Rob James will be
                           made

F03/0062   Finalization of array constructors

  Rob James' NO comment for F03/0062:

    For both edits, it is not enough just to change the first occurrence
    of "structure".  Both occurrences of "structure" on these lines
    should be changed to "structure or array".

  Conclusion on F03/0062:  Passed J3 letter ballot #12 with the above
                           change

F03/0063   Procedure pointers in BLOCK DATA program units

  Rob James' YES comment for F03/0063:

    I'm not sure that the line number is right for the last edit.  It
    seems to me that this would go better at [254:3].

  Conclusion on F03/0063:  Has not yet passed J3 letter ballot #12 -
                           /interp will consider the above comment at
                           meeting #175

F03/0064   Recursive declaration of procedure interfaces

  Rob James' NO comment for F03/0064:

    There are some cases of this kind of thing that don't seem to be
   caught by this interpretation response.  In particular, these cases
    don't seem to be prohibited:

    MODULE m1
    CONTAINS
     SUBROUTINE s(p)
        PROCEDURE(s) :: p
      END SUBROUTINE
    END MODULE

    MODULE m2
    CONTAINS
      SUBROUTINE s1(a)
        PROCEDURE(s2) :: a
      END SUBROUTINE
      SUBROUTINE s2(b)
        PROCEDURE(s1) :: b
      END SUBROUTINE
    END MODULE

    Maybe some sort of statement would cover all of these cases if it is
    along the lines that a dummy procedure's characteristics can't
    depend on the characteristics of the procedure or interface body in
    which it is declared.

  Conclusion on F03/0064:  Has not yet passed J3 letter ballot #12 -
                           /interp will consider the above comment at
                           meeting #175

F03/0070   Can child I/O statements be advancing I/O statements?

 Rob James' YES comment for F03/0070:

  The words "nonadvancing" and "nonchild" should not be hyphenated.

  Conclusion on F03/0070:  Passed J3 letter ballot #12 with the above
                           changes

F03/0072   Default initialization for "automatic" components

  Bill Long's YES Comment for F03/0072:

    Was it intended that the constraint include a rule reference? Perhaps
    beginning with "C447a (R440) If".

  Conclusion on F03/0072:  Passed J3 letter ballot #12 with the above
                           change
