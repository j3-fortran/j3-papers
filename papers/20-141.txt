Date: 2020-October-05

Reference: 20-007

UTI-017, relative to the new module intrinsic procedure C_F_STRPOINTER,
says:

"If C_CHAR==-1, do these exist?
If C_CHAR is equal to -1, are these generic procedures:
(1) nonexistent,
(2) existent but with no specific procedures, or
(3) processor-dependent which of the above.
As is, it is effectively (3) as in "not standardised", but without any
mention in Annex A. I suggest (2) would be the best option here."

In addition, it was noticed that C_F_STRPOINTER is not simple. Edits are
provided to correct these issues.

Replace:

"The C_F_POINTER subroutine is impure;"

with:

"The C_F_POINTER and C_F_STRPOINTER subroutines are impure;"

491:10+ [18.2.3.5p3+ C_F_STRPOINTER]

Add a Note:

"If C_CHAR has the value -1, indicating that there is no C character kind,
the generic subroutine C_F_STRPOINTER does not resolve to a specific
procedure."

Delete UTI-017.
