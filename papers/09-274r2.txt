1.  Discussion

The edits proposed here are revisions of those in 09-186r3,
following comments by Malcolm Cohen in 09-239.


2.  Edits

[128:16]. In 6.7.1.2 Execution of an ALLOCATE statement, para 4,
change "(8.5.1)" to "(8.5.2)".

[128:12-13] In 6.7.1.2 Execution of an ALLOCATE statement, para 3,
replace "each" by "every" twice.

[131:15]In 6.7.3.2 Deallocation of allocatable variables, para 11,
change "(8.5.1)" to "(8.5.2)".

[187:19] In 8.5.1 Image control statements, para 1, delete "as".

[187:20] In 8.5.1 Image control statements, para 2, replace the
first sentence of p2 with
  "Execution of an image control statement divides the execution
  sequence on an image into segments."

[188:8-9] In 8.5.2 Segements, para 1, make two edits:
    after "first" add "execution of an" 
and after "last" add "execution of an".


[191:2-3] In 8.5.5 SYNC MEMORY statement, para 1, replace
"The SYNC MEMORY ... each of which" by
"Execution of a SYNC MEMORY statement ends one segment and begins
another; these two segments".


[192] In 8.5.5 SYNC MEMORY statement, NOTE 8.39:

Change the fifth line of the example program segment (now blank)
to "   ...   ".

In the 8th line, replace
"! Preceding segment" with  "! Segment <P_i>"

In the 10th line, replace
"segment <P_i>" with  "segment <P_{i+1}>"

Delete the 11th line:
    "SYNC MEMORY      !B"

In the 14th line, replace
"segment <Q_j>" with  "segment <Q_{j-1}>"

In the 17th line, replace "! C" by "! B".

In the 18th line, replace
"Subsequent segment" with  "Segment <Q_j>".

Replace the first para after the program text with:
"The DO WHILE loop does not complete until VAL is defined with the
value false. This is the cooperative synchronization that provides the
dependency that image Q does not complete segment <Q_{j-1}> until
the CALL statement in segment <P_{i+1}> completes.  This ensures that
the execution of segment <P_i> on image P precedes execution of
segment <Q_j> on image Q."

In the second paragraph, replace "(locking)" by "(segment <P_{i+1}>)" 
and replace "the work" by "work in segment <P_i>".

Delete the third paragraph.

In the fourth paragraph, replace "third" by "second" and "(C)" by "(B)".

[It is clearer to have the description in 8.5.5p3 use the same segment
labels as the example in Note 8.39.]
