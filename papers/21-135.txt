Subject: Improving security of type-bound elemental functions

Discussion
----------

The passed-object dummy argument of a function bound to an extensible
type is required to be polymorphic.

A generic operator binding is required to have a passed-object dummy
argument.

If an operation is expected to have a result that is of the same dynamic
type as its arguments, this can only be accomplished in one of two ways:

  (1) The result is polymorphic, which requires it to be allocatable or
      a pointer, or
  
  (2) the function is overridden in every extension.

If the function is elemental, the result cannot be allocatable or
a pointer, and therefore cannot be polymorphic.

There is no way that the author of a class can require functions to be
overridden.

Therefore, if one develops a class to solve a particular problem, and it
is later extended, perhaps by a different author, to solve a related
problem, elemental functions and generic elemental operator bindings
that are not overridden necessarily return nonpolymorphic results of the
base type. This is dangerous.

Proposal 1
----------

In addition to allowing a CLASSOF declaration for an allocatable or
pointer function result, allow it for a function result that is neither
allocatable nor a pointer, provided the <data-ref> in the CLASSOF
declaration specifies a nonoptional nonallocatable nonpointer
polymorphic dummy argument of that function. Where the function is type
bound, if the result is not allocatable or a pointer, require the
<data-ref> in the CLASSOF declaration to refer to the passed-object
dummy argument.

Prohibiting the ALLOCATABLE or POINTER attribute for the <data-ref>
allows the dynamic type of the result to be determined at the moment
function execution commences. This also limits the <data-ref> to dummy
arguments, but allowing a host-associated dummy argument in this role is
probably unwise.

Specify that if the result is neither allocatable nor a pointer, the
dynamic type of the result is the same as the dynamic type of the
<data-ref> in the CLASSOF declaration (which can be determined when
function execution commences because the <data-ref> is neither
allocatable nor a pointer, and not optional).

This allows the result of an elemental function to be polymorphic with
the same declared and dynamic type as the passed-object dummy argument.
In an elemental reference, the result is an array with elements of
homogeneous dynamic type because the actual argument associated with the
passed-object dummy argument is an array with elements of homogeneous
dynamic type.

Proposal 2
----------

Allow a <binding-attr>, say SHALL_OVERRIDE, that specifies a type-bound
procedure or generic binding must be overridden in extensions. Thereby,
in case the result of a type-bound elemental function is not CLASSOF,
the author of a base type can require that the author of an extension
type is required to override the binding, and hopefully will have the
sense to provide one with a result type that is the same as the
extension type.

Proposal 1 is a better solution to the type-bound elemental function
problem, but Proposal 2 has merit on its own.

Proposal 3
----------

As Vipul Parekh advocated in 19-186, provide a <type-attr>, say
NON_EXTENSIBLE, that prohibits a type from being extended. Thereby, one
need not worry that a type-bound elemental function will be invoked with
arguments of an extended type, but return a result of the base type. One
can still "extend" such a type by including a component of its type in
an "extension" type. This is the old way, but it still works.

It is already specified (C765) that the passed-object dummy argument of
a procedure bound to a nonextensible type cannot be polymorphic.

Presently, the only nonextensible types are BIND and SEQUENCE types (and
C_PTR and C_FUNPTR, which might be BIND, but this appears not to be
specified anywhere). SEQUENCE types are undesirable because objects of
SEQUENCE types have equivalent type according to their types' structures
(which it is the author's responsibility to ensure), not their
declarations (which the processor can enforce).

Proposal 1 is a better solution to the type-bound elemental function
problem, but Proposal 3 has merit on its own.

Edits 1 (to guage the scope)
----------------------------

[56:28 7.3.2.1 Type Specifier Syntax C708] Remove "or CLASSOF".

[56:29+ 7.3.2.1 Type Specifier Syntax] Insert a new constraint:

"C708a An entity declared with the CLASSOF keyword shall be a dummy
       argument or function result, or have the ALLOCATABLE or POINTER
       attribute. If it is a function result that is neither allocatable
       nor a pointer, the <data-ref> shall specify a nonoptional
       nonallocatable nonpointer polymorphic dummy argument of the same
       function."

[79:36+ 7.5.5 Type-bound procedures] Insert a new constraint:

"C786a If NOPASS does not appear, the type-bound procedure is a
       function, the result is declared using the CLASSOF keyword, and
       the result is neither allocatable nor a pointer, the <data-ref>
       in the CLASSOF declaration shall specify the passed-object dummy
       argument."

[329:31+ 16.6.2.2p4+ Function subprogram] Insert a paragraph:

"If the function result is declared using the CLASSOF keyword and is
neither allocatable nor a pointer, the dynamic type of the result is the
same as the dynamic type of the dummy argument specified by the
<data-ref> in the CLASSOF declaration."

<binding-attr>:

"                      <<or>> SHALL_OVERRIDE"

[80:2+ 7.5.5 Type-bound procedures] Insert a new constraint:

"C790a In an extention type, every procedure binding in the parent type
       that has the SHALL_OVERRIDE attribute shall be overridden, and
       the binding in the extension type shall have the SHALL_OVERRIDE
       attribute."

----------------------------

[67:14+ 7.5.2.1 Syntax of a derived-type definition] Add an alternative

[82:29-29 7.5.7.1p1 Extensible, extended, and abstract types] Replace
the paragraph:

"A derived type that does not have the NON_EXTENSIBLE, BIND, or SEQUENCE
attribute is an extensible type."

Insert a note

  "The types C_PTR and C_FUNPTR from the intrinsic module ISO_C_BINDING
   are not extensible."

[494:2 18.3.2p1 Interoperability with C pointer types] After "with"
insert "the NON_EXTENSIBLE attribute and".

Alternative: After "with" insert "the BIND attribute and".
