From: Malcolm Cohen
Subject: US13 scoped access to module entities
Date: 2026-February-22
Reference: 25-119r1.

Paper 25-119r1 recommended ceasing work on this feature proposal as originally
envisaged, and instead investigate alternative ideas with a view to inclusion
in some later revision (not necessarily Fortran 2028).

Those investigations have not yet borne fruit, and thus cannot be included in
Fortran 2028 without disrupting the schedule.

Therefore we recommend that this feature not be included in Fortran 2028.
Investigations should continue, with a view towards making a concrete proposal
for Fortran 203z.
