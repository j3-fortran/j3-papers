In the rearrangement of subclauses in Clause 7, the table numbers seem
to have gotten offset.  The first Table in Clause 7 is now numbered
7.2.  There is no longer a Table 7.1. Similarly, there is no table
numbered 7.5, skipping from Table 7.4 at [141:5+] to Table 7.6 at
[143:6+], with no tables between.

A search for "team" finds two spurious entries in Annex D that should
be removed. (Originally reported by Dick Hendrickson).


Edits to 09-007r3:

[137:4+] In 7.1.3 "Precedence of operators", renumber Table 7.2 to be
Table 7.1, renumber subsequent Tables in Clause 7 accordingly, and
modify references to the tables accordingly.


[579] In D.2 "Syntax rule cross-reference", delete the line that
contains:

  "____ <image-team>          R905, R931"


[584] In D.2 "Syntax rule cross-reference", delete the line that
contains:

  "____ <sync-team-stmt>      R214"
