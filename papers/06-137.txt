Subject:    MOLD= on ALLOCATE
References: 02-274, 03-254, 04-152
Number:     J3-034

Basic Functionality: 

A MOLD keyword should be added to ALLOCATE similar to the SOURCE keyword,
which would provide only the type and deferred type parameters of the
allocated data, but not the values.

Specification and syntax:

Add a MOLD keyword to the ALLOCATE statement, to determine the type and
type parameters of the allocated object, just like SOURCE, but without
copying the value to the allocated object.  Default initialization may
be applied.

Relax the prohibition against allocating more than one object in an
ALLOCATE statement with SOURCE=.

Allow the MOLD= expression to be any rank, regardless of the allocation
objects.

Edits with respect to 04-007:

[110:15+] Add another right-hand side to R624:

                  "<<or>> MOLD = <source-expr>"

[111:7-8,11] Within C623 and C625, replace "<type-spec> or SOURCE=" by
", <type-spec>, SOURCE=, or MOLD=" twice.

[111:21] Within C631 replace "<type-spec> shall not appear" with "neither
<type-spec> nor MOLD= shall appear".

[111:21-23] Replace C631 and C632 with
 "C631 (R623) At most one of SOURCE=, MOLD= and <type-spec> shall appear.

  C632 (R623) Each <allocate-object> shall be type compatible (5.1.1.2)
              with <source-expr>.  If SOURCE= appears, <source-expr> shall
              be a scalar or have the same rank as each <allocate-object>."

[111:32-36] Replace the third paragraph after C633 by
 "If <type-spec> is specified, each <allocate-object> is allocated with the
  specified dynamic type and type parameters; if <source-expr> is specified,
  the <allocate-object> is allocated with the same type and type parameters as
  those of the dynamic type of <source-expr>; otherwise, each <allocate-object>
  is allocated with its dynamic type the same as its declared type and type
  parameter values."

{Reworded to avoid the awful "allocation allocates".
 Note to editor: it might be better to maintain a distinction between
 specifying the type and type parameter values, and allocating an object
 with those specifications.  Deferred.}

[111:37-39] Replace the fourth paragraph after C633 because the first
sentence is now covered by the revised previous paragraph, it needs
rewording to make up for this deletion, the term "nondeferred value" has
no meaning, and "of any of the" is too wordy:

 "If <type-spec> appears and the value of a type parameter it specifies
 differs from the value of a corresponding nondeferred type parameter
 specified in the declaration of any <allocate-object>, an error condition
 occurs.  If the value of a nondeferred length type parameter of an
 <allocate-object> is different from the value of the corresponding type
 parameter of <source-expr>, an error condition occurs."

[112:10+] Add a new paragraph and Note before Note 6.19:

 "If MOLD= appears and <source-expr> is a variable, its value need not be
  defined.

  NOTE 6.18a
  The <mold-expr> can be an array or scalar independently of whether an
  <allocate-object> is an array or a scalar.  Only the dynamic type and type
  parameter values of <mold-expr> are relevant; its rank, shape and value
  are not."
