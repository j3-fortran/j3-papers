Subject: Lower Case and Mixed Case Syntax Elements


1.  Rationale

The need to restrict syntax elements to upper case letters for guaranteed portability is a relic from the 1960s.  Up until the early 1980s, some machines did not support lower case letters in their character sets.  Now, such a restriction is no longer necessary; all platforms with a Fortran 90 processor include support for lower case letters.

Requiring support for lower case letters in Fortran syntax elements would allow programmers to write more visually appealing code.  All other major programming languages already support lower case letters in their syntax elements.

Removing this restriction would help remove the image that Fortran still has of being a "Stone Age" relic.

2.  Technical Specification

This proposal would require the inclusion of lower case letters in the Fortran character set .  It also would require a Fortran processor to make lower case or mixed case syntax elements equivalent to upper case syntax elements.  There are two exceptions:

    	(1)  in a character context, i.e., within a character literal constant or a character string edit descriptor; and
      (2)  eventually, as required by features needed to implement interoperability with C.

It is the intent of this proposal to construe exception (2) as narrowly as possible.  The exception for a character context is modified slightly so that character expressions that equate to keywords are case insensitive unless there is a specific constraint that specifies that a character expression for a particular keyword is either case sensitive or processor dependent.

In a Fortran 90 standard-conforming program, symbolic names are case insensitive.  Some processors offer, as an extension, a user-selectable option that allows symbolic names to be case sensitive.  Under this proposal, symbolic names in a standard-conforming program would still be case insensitive.  A processor could continue to offer the user-selectable option as an extension to the standard and not be in violation of the standard.

Example:

If this proposal is adopted, the following constructs would all be equivalent and standard conforming on all processors.  In Fortran 90 and Fortran 95, only the first option is standard-conforming on all processors.

          1:	IF (NDATE < NLAST_DATE)  THEN
               		NDATE = NDATE + 1
          		     CALL BIG_COMPLEX_OPERATION (NDATE)
          	  END IF

          2:	if (ndate < nlast_date)  then
          	     	ndate = ndate + 1
          		     call big_complex_operation (ndate)
          	  end if

          3:	If (NDate < NLast_Date)  Then
		               NDate = NDate + 1
	          	     Call Big_Complex_Operation (NDate)
	            End If

3.  Proposed Edits to be Operated on Later

These edits are with respect to the Fortran 95 Committee Draft, X3J3 / 96-007.

Section 3.1.1
[21:24-26+]  Change the text to read:
"The set of letters defines the syntactic class letter.  A processor shall include lower case and upper case letters.

The lower case letters are equivalent to the corresponding upper case letters except:
	    (1)  in a character context (3.3); and
	    (2)  as required by C language interface features (16) in order to access
          symbolic names from C language procedures and other C language constructs
          accessible from Fortran.

Exception (1) shall not apply to any instance of a keyword which accepts a character expression unless there is a specific constraint for a specific keyword and such constraint makes the case of the character expression either case sensitive or processor-dependent."

As an extension, a processor could offer a user-selectable option to allow symbolic names to be case sensitive and not be in violation of the standard.

Example:  The following constructs are all equivalent and standard conforming on all processors.  In Fortran 90 and Fortran 95, only the first option is standard-conforming on all processors.

          1:	IF (NDATE < NLAST_DATE)  THEN
          	    		NDATE = NDATE + 1
			              CALL BIG_COMPLEX_OPERATION (NDATE)
           		END IF

          2:	if (ndate < nlast_date)  then
			              ndate = ndate + 1
			              call big_complex_operation (ndate)
           		end if

         	3:	If (NDate < NLast_Date)  Then
			              NDate = NDate + 1
			              Call Big_Complex_Operation (NDate)
		           End If
