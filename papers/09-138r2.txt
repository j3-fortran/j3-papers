3. Edits to 09-007
------------------

[100-101: Notes in the middle of VOLATILE] Move to the end of 5.3.19.
{The edit from F03/0099 has already been applied here, but when looking at
 it I noticed there was no good reason for these notes to violate the
 recommendation in the ISO guidelines.}

[122:7-8] Replace the existing definition which is
  "A <<whole array>> is a named array, which may be either a named
  constant (5.1.2.10, 5.2.9) or a variable; no subscript list is
  appended to the name."
with
  "A <<whole array>> is a named array or a structure component whose
   final <part-ref> is an array component name; no subscript list is
  appended."
{F03/0077.  Make "whole array" include the whole array component case.}

[122:10-11] Replace "whole array name" with "whole array designator",
            twice.
{F03/0077.}

[130:21]  At the end of the last sentence in 6.6.1.3 insert
  "unless the SOURCE= specifier appears and the corresponding
   component of the <source-expr> is allocated".
{F03/0098.}

[214:19] In 9.5.1 Control information list,
  "ID = <scalar-int-variable>" -> "ID = <id-variable>"
{F03/0113.}

[215:1+] Insert new BNF rule and constraint
  "R913a <id-variable> <<is>> <scalar-int-variable>

   C908a (R913a) The <scalar-int-variable> shall have a decimal range
         no smaller than that of default integer."
{F03/0113.  Require default integer or larger.}

[218:3] In 9.6.2.9 ID= specifier in a data transfer statement,
	 Change "This value" to
  "If this value is zero, the data transfer operation has been
   completed.  A nonzero value"
{F03/0113.  Zero = "it was done synchronously already" value.}

[218:4] After "operation." insert
  "This identifier is different from the identifier of any other
   pending data transfer operation for this unit."
{F03/0113.  Require uniqueness.}

[222:26+]
  In 9.5.3 "Execution of a data transfer input/output statement",
  immediately before Note 9.37 insert a new paragraph
    "If execution of the program is terminated during execution of a WRITE
     or PRINT statement, the contents of the file become undefined.".
{F03/0117.}

[233:8] Before "the identifier" insert "zero or".
[233:9] After "operation" insert ", if any,".
{F03/0113.  Make ID=zero do nothing in WAIT.}

[245:17] Delete the last paragraph of 9.12 "Restrictions on
  input/output statements" which currently reads
  "A STOP statement or ALL STOP statement shall not be executed during
   execution of an input/output statement."
{F03/0117.}

[267:5] In Section 10.10.4 "List-directed output", add the following
        to the end of the first paragraph:
  "Two undelimited character sequences are considered adjacent when
   both were written using list-directed input/output, no intervening
   data transfer or input/output file positioning operations on that
   unit occurred, and both were written either by a single data
   transfer statement, or during the execution of a parent data
   transfer statement along with its child data transfer statements."
{F03/0049.
 NOTE: Before the sentences added by F03/0101 (Corrigendum 3).}

[294:3+(12.5.1 C1229+)] Insert new constraint
  "C1229a (R1221) "The <data-ref> shall not be an unallocated allocatable
          variable or a pointer whose association status is disassociated
          or undefined."
{F03/0003, F03/0004.}

[297:15] After "default character", insert
  "or character with the C character kind (15.2.2)".
{F03/0074.  "\ref{D15:Named constants and derived types in the module}".}
Editor: J3 changed "or of type character with the C character kind
(15.2.2)" to "or character with the C character kind (15.2.2)".

[297:17,19] After each "default character",
  Insert "or of type character with the C character kind", twice.
{F03/0074.}

[303:39+(12.5.2.12p3)] Add new items to the numbered list in 12.5.2.12
  "(11) It shall not be supplied as the <data-ref> in a
        <procedure-designator>.
   (12) It shall not be supplied as the <scalar-variable> in a
        <proc-component-ref>."
{F03/0109.}

[365:19] After "a whole array" delete "or array structure component".
{F03/0077.  No longer need kludgy wording in LBOUND.}

[400:4-5] After "a whole array" delete "or array structure component".
{F03/0077.  No longer need kludgy wording in UBOUND.}

[439:15-16] In the first sentence of the first paragraph after NOTE 15.11
	    in subclause 15.3.4,
  replace "have types and type parameters that are interoperable with the
  	   types of the corresponding components of the struct type"
  with
    "would interoperate with corresponding components of the C struct type
     as described in 15.3.5 and 15.3.6 if the components were variables".
{F03/0075.
 15.3.5 and 15.3.6 are \ref{D15:Interoperability of scalar variables} and
 \ref{D15:Interoperability of array variables} respectively.}

[456:35+]  Add a new paragraph at the end of 16.5.2.6,
  "The association status of a pointer object with the VOLATILE
   attribute might change by means not specified by the program."
{F03/0099.}

[462:24] 16.6.5, before "causes that" insert
  ", except by an ALLOCATE statement with a SOURCE= specifier,"
{F03/0098.}

[462:25+] 16.6.5, insert new list item after (19)
  "(19a) Successful execution of an ALLOCATE statement with a SOURCE=
         specifier causes a subobject of the allocated object to
         become defined if the corresponding subobject of the SOURCE=
         expression is defined."
{F03/0098.}

[462:28] In item (21), change
         "Execution of a pointer assignment statement that associates
         a pointer with a target that is defined causes the pointer to
         become defined."
         to
         "When a pointer becomes associated with a target that is defined,
         the pointer becomes defined."
{Not part of F03/0102, but spotted while looking at it.  A pointer can
 become associated with a target via argument association.}
Editor: it used to be 'change
    "Execution of a pointer assignment statement that associates a pointer"
  to
    "When a pointer becomes associated"'

[462:39] In 16.6.5 list item (26) change "becomes" to "might become".
{F03/0099.}

[463:43-44] 16.6.6, list item (12), replace list item with
  "Successful allocation of an ALLOCATE statement with no SOURCE=
   specifier causes a subcomponent of an allocated object to become
   undefined if default initialization has not been specified for
   that subcomponent."
{F03/0098.}

[463:44+]  16.6.6, add a new list item after (12),
  "(12a) Successful execution of an ALLOCATE statement with a SOURCE=
         specifier causes a subobject of the allocated object to
         become undefined if the corresponding subobject of the
         SOURCE= expression is undefined."
{F03/0098.}

[464:29+] In 16.6.6 after the last list item insert a new list item
  "(24) An object with the VOLATILE attribute (5.3.19) might become
        undefined by means not specified by the program."
{F03/0099.}

[464:29+] In 16.6.6 after the last list item insert a new list item
  "(25) When a pointer becomes associated with a target that is
        undefined, the pointer becomes undefined."
{Recommendation from F03/0102.}
