From: Malcolm Cohen
Subject: Simpler enumeration types specs and syntax
Date: 2021-March-02
Reference: 21-110.


1. Introduction

This paper is a revision of part 3 of 21-110 (r0).

Over the last year it seems that our approach to "true enumeration types"
has become too complicated, and unnecessarily so. This paper provides the
specs and syntax for the basic functionality, without inhibiting future
extension.

The possible additional syntax mentioned in 21-110 section 3 has been
deleted (see 21-110 if interested). This is not core functionality and
could be added in F202y or later without difficulty.

Notable changes since 21-110 section 3 are:
    - addition of SELECT CASE
    - addition of primitive i/o
Notable changes since 21-120r1
    - three options for NEXT and PREVIOUS, to be straw-voted.
Since 12-120r2
    - all but the chosen option for NEXT and PREVIOUS removed.

2. Simpler true enumerations

2.1 Requirements

A true enumeration type is a new type, not a renaming of integer.
The enumerators are named constants of this type.
No requirement should be placed on the internal representation.
The operations of First, Last, Next, and Previous are available.
Relational operations between objects of the same enumeration type are
available.
Explicit conversion to/from type Integer is available.
No arithmetic or other operations.
Primitive input/output should be available, without inhibiting future
addition of sophisticated input/output.

2.2 Specifications

(a) The enumeration type is a user-defined type that is not a structure
    type, i.e. it is rather like a derived type but has no components.

Comment: It behaves somewhat like a derived type with a hidden anonymous
         component. Either we split derived types into structure types and
         other types, or we just add a new kind of type. The latter seems
         easier, involving less terminology change to the standard.

(b) No polymorphic entities with a declared type of an enumeration type.

(c) Variables of the type can take on only values of the type, or be
    undefined. Values of the type are the enumerators only.

(d) An intrinsic constructor of the type provides conversion from type
    Integer only. The INT intrinsic provides conversion to type Integer.

(e) Strict type safety, viz the enumerators are of that type.

(f) No DO loop or other such; that functionality is available, though with
    extra verbosity, using integers and conversions.

(g) Enumerators come without any enhanced namespace management, i.e. their
    names are normal class one names.

(h) The Fast, Last, Next, and Previous operations are provided
    intrinsically, not type-bound.

(i) Enumeration variables are initially undefined, like other variables.

(j) Relational operations order by the order of definition of the
    enumerators, e.g. the first one defined is less than all the others.

(k) SELECT CASE can be used.

(l) Formatted input/output of enumeration type values using their ordinals
    is available. To avoid inhibiting future improvements, list-directed
    and namelist i/o should not be permitted.

Comments:
    (11) Extending an enumeration could be useful, but at this time that
         would be an unnecessary frippery. We need to focus on having a
         solid and reliable basic feature.
    (12) Similarly, a DO index of an enumeration type would sometimes be
         useful, but is an unnecessary frill at this stage.
    (13) I note that enumerators as class one names is not only simpler
         but what WG5 asked us to do in the first place.
    (13) Fortran already has basic namespace management (USE ONLY and
         renaming). Some ideas for extensions to that have already been
         floated (for a future revision, possibly F202y); we should not
         preempt that with a complicated feature here.
    (14) Intrinsic operations and functions are already generic and don't
         conflict with user-defined operations and functions. Making the
         operations on enumerations type-bound would be likely to inhibit
         future namespace management features.
    (15) Being able to specify an initial value would be useful, but is not
         core functionality.
    (16) The removal of "sophisticated" i/o is both to simplify the changes
         to the standard, and to reduce implementation effort.

2.3 Syntax

<enumeration-type-def> <<is>> <enumeration-type-stmt>
                                <enumeration-enumerator-stmt>
                                [ <enumeration-enumerator-stmt> ]...
                              <end-enumeration-type-stmt>

<enumeration-type-stmt> <<is>>
    ENUMERATION TYPE [ [ , <access-spec> ] :: ] <enumeration-type-name>

Constraint: The <access-spec> shall only appear in the specification part
            of a module.

<enumeration-enumerator-stmt> <<is>>
    ENUMERATOR [ :: ] <enumerator-name-list>

<end-enumeration-type-stmt> <<is>>
    END ENUMERATION TYPE [ <enumeration-type-name> ]

Constraint: If <enumeration-type-name> appears on an END ENUMERATION TYPE
            statement, it shall be the same as on the ENUMERATION TYPE
            statement.

The <access-spec> on an ENUMERATION TYPE statement specifies the
accessibility of the <enumeration-type-name> and the default accessibility
of its enumerators. The accessibility of an enumerator may be confirmed or
overridden by an <access-stmt>.

An enumeration type is a user-defined type that is not a structure type.

Comment: See above comments re terminology.

An entity of enumeration type is declared using the TYPE specifier, just as
if it were a derived type.

The name of the type operates as a constructor; it takes an integer and
returns a value of the type. As the type has no named component, there is
no keyword form of the constructor. The constructor returns the enumerator
value with the ordinal number of the integer value given. The integer
value shall be positive and less than or equal to the number of enumerators
of the type.

Conversion to Integer: INT(enumeration value) = the ordinal number of the
    enumerator in the type definition. The constructor typename(integer)
    returns the enumeration value with that ordinal number; integer shall
    be in the range 1...N, where N is the number of enumerators.

Relationals: Noted that a.rel.b has the same value as INT(a).rel.INT(b).

An entity of enumeration type shall not appear in a list-directed data
transfer statement or in a NAMELIST specification. In a formatted i/o
statement, an entity of enumeration type shall be processed by an integer
data edit descriptor I, B, O, or Z. The input value shall be in range.

The operations First, Last, Next and Previous shall be provided as follows.

First: typename(1).

Last: HUGE(any enumeration value or variable).

Next, Previous: New SIMPLE intrinsic procedures with those names.
    The functions both have an optional STAT argument. Without STAT,
    PREVIOUS(first) and NEXT(last) cause error termination.
    With STAT, these return the argument value returned "clamped", i.e.
    the value of the argument, and STAT is set to a positive value.
    STAT is set to zero if no clamping occurred.

Comment: This cannot be written as a pure user-defined function.

  End Subroutine
  Subroutine wcheck(w)
    Type(w_value),Intent(In) :: w
    Select Case(w)

      Stop 'Invalid w selected'
    Case Default
      Stop 'Unrecognized w selected'
    End Select
  End Subroutine
End Module

Program example
  Use enumeration_mod
  Type(v_value) :: x = v_one
  Type(v_value) :: y = v_value(2)   ! Explicit constructor producing v_two.
  Type(v_value) :: z,nz             ! Initially undefined.
  Call sub(x)
  Call sub(v_three)
  z = v_value(1)                    ! First value.
  Do
    If (z==Huge(x)) Write (*,'(A)',Advance='No') ' Huge:'
    Call sub(z)
    nz = Next(z)
    If (z==nz) Exit
    z = nz
  End Do
End Program

Program invalid
  Use enumeration_mod
  Type(v_value) :: a, b
  a = 1         ! INVALID - wrong type (INTEGER).
  b = w1        ! INVALID - wrong enumeration type.
  Print *,a     ! INVALID - list-directed i/o not available.
End Program

Module example2
  Use enumeration_mod
  Type vw

  End Type
Contains
  Subroutine showme(ka)
    Type(vw),Intent(In) :: ka
    Print 1,ka
1   Format(1X,'v ordinal is ',I0,', w ordinal is ',I0)
  End Subroutine
End Module

Program invalid2
  Use example2
  Type(vw) badx
  Namelist/kaas/ badx       ! INVALID - not permitted in NAMELIST.
  Print *, badx             ! INVALID - list-directed i/o not available.
