Subject:   F2008 interp: Repeated type-bound procedure binding
Date: 2016 May 05

NUMBER: F08/
TITLE: Can a binding name be repeated in a type-bound declaration?
KEYWORDS: Generic, generics, type-bound procedures
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTIONS:

The standard has many places where it specifies that a name or attribute
cannot be given more than once, but some situations are not covered.

Q1:

Consider:

  type :: len_test_type
    integer, private :: bdata
    contains
      generic :: my_get => get, get, put ! (A)
      generic :: my_get => put ! (A)
      procedure :: get => lmit_get
      procedure :: put => lmit_put, put => lmit_put (B)
  end type len_test_type

Consider the repetition of binding-name "get" and "put" in (A):

C472 says "Each binding-name in binding-name-list shall be the name of
a specific binding of the type.", but that is satisfied here.

C514 says "An entity shall not be explicitly given any attribute more
than once in a scoping unit." which usually covers such things, but it
discusses attributes only, and being a binding name in a generic
declaration isn't an attribute.

Was this repetition intended to be permitted?

Q2:

Was the repetition of the binding-name "lmit_put" at (B) intended to be
permitted? Consider also that a specific binding can be inherited. For
example:

  type t
  contains
    procedure p
    generic :: g => p
  end type
  type,extends(t) :: t2
  contains
    generic :: g => p ! BAD - t2 already inherited this
  end type

ANSWER:

A1: No, it was not intended to be permitted. 4.5.5p7 says "Each additional
GENERIC statement with the same generic-spec extends the generic
interface." Whether a separate GENERIC statement is used or if
multiple binding-names appear on a single GENERIC statement, the
appearance of a binding name extends the generic interface, but a
duplicate name can't do that.

Also, C1209 in 12.4.3.1 (Interface block) says "A procedure-name shall
not specify a procedure that is specified previously in any procedure-stmt
in any accessible interface with the same generic identifier.", which
imposes a restriction on generic interface blocks.

An edit to correct this is supplied.

A2: No, it was not intended to be permitted. An edit to correct this is
supplied.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[73:16+, 4.5.5]

Insert the constraint:

"C465+ (R449) Each specific <type-bound procedure> of a type shall be
declared by exactly one <type-bound-proc-decl> in the derived type
definition."

[73:23+, 4.5.5]

Insert the constraint:

"C467+ (R450) A <binding-name> in a type-bound GENERIC statement shall
not specify a specific binding that was inherited or specified
previously for the same generic identifier in that derived type
definition."

EDITS to 16-007r1:

[75:16+, 4.5.5]

Insert the constraint:

"C470+ (R450) Each specific <type-bound procedure> of a type shall be
declared by exactly one <type-bound-proc-decl> in the derived type
definition."

[75:23+, 4.5.5]

Insert the constraint:

"C472+ (R451) A <binding-name> in a type-bound GENERIC statement shall
not specify a specific binding that was inherited or specified
previously for the same generic identifier in that derived type
definition."
