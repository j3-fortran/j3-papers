Subject: More reduce() (and co_reduce())

Reference: 14-007r1, 14-130

This paper tries to consolidate commonalities
of REDUCE and CO_REDUCE in one place.  Edits are provided
for 14-007, but not for 14-130 due to the state of flux of 14-130.
If this passes (in some form), edits for 14-130 will be made
at that time.

Also, 14-007 uses the term OPERATION for the reduction function,
where 14-130 uses the term OPERATOR.  This paper (and its possible
future continuation paper) could be a vehicle to reconcile the usage.
Here, OPERATION is used.

The goal of REDUCE and CO_REDUCE is to replace

ACC = <some-initial-value>
DO I = LBOUND( ARRAY, DIM= 1), UBOUND( ARRAY, DIM= 1)
   ACC = OPERATION( ACC, ARRAY( I))
END DO

or

ACC = <some-initial-value>
IF( THIS_IMAGE() == <some-image> )THEN
   DO I = 1, NUM_IMAGES()
      ACC = OPERATION( ACC, CO_ARRAY[ I])
   END DO
END IF
! optionally broadcast the result

with a single function reference.

Note that the statement in the loop body could have been

OPERATION( ARRAY( I), ACC) or OPERATION( CO_ARRAY[ I], ACC),

respectively.  (That is, the ACC variable could be the first
or second argument to the OPERATION function.)

Note further that the OPERATION function above need not
1. have an OPERATOR interface, or
2. be pure, or
3. be associative, or
4. be commutitive.

Optimizing compilers might unroll these loops.  If vector instructions
are available these loops might be vectorized, which could lead
to out-of-order evaluation of scalar operands at either end
of the loop.  However, there is a specified order of operations.

Assuming that the size of the set is small and fixed, and if
the OPERATION function has an operator interface, then the loops
could be written as (given OPERATOR( .OP.) for example),

ACC = ARRAY( 1) .OP. ARRAY( 2) .OP. ... .OP. ARRAY( N)

and similarly for the CO_REDUCE case.  Subclaus 7.1.6.3 gives
the compiler latitude to evaluate the operations of the expression
in any order.

While elements of array operands are generally evaluated in any order,
and images execute asynchronously, note that the counted DO-loop cannot
be replaced by a DO CONCURRENT loop.  (See text at [179:20-22].)

The advantages of REDUCE and CO_REDUCE are supposed to be

1. succinctness of expression,
and
2. efficiency of execution.

The succinctness of expression is simple:  The four (or more) statements
of the loop and its preamble are replaced by one statement containing
a single function reference, and no loop index is visible.
If DIM= is present, there is an even greater simplification of replacing
the outer loops over the remaining array extents, with more invisible
loop indices.

The efficiency of execution is (presumably) gained by concurrent
execution and/or reordering and overlapping of the function evaluations.
Again, if DIM= is present, there is greater opportunity
for efficiency improvements due to independent reductions for each
array element of the result.

The models of REDUCE and CO_REDUCE are similar.  All operands
form a set.  Two operands are removed from the set and applied
as arguments to the OPERATION function.  The result of the function
is returned to the set.  When the set has one element, its value
is returned as the REDUCE or CO_REDUCE value.

The specification for REDUCE says its set is taken in array-element
order, and says the operands to OPERATION are adjacent elements.
However, it does not say which pair of array elements are chosen first.
Furthermore, while the specification says the sequence is
in array element order, this doesn't appear in the normative text.
The corresponding specification is missing from the CO_REDUCE
specification and text.

REDUCE also has an IDENTITY argument, whose value, if present, is
returned in the case of a zero-sized array.  This case is not occurring
with CO_REDUCE so it has no corresponding IDENTITY argument.  While
the IDENTITY value provides a value when it is present, there is no
default value when it is not.  Such a default is defined for existing
reduction routines (SUM, PRODUCT, and similar) where the operation
is known (so the appropriate identity value is known).

The OPERATION function has two arguments of the type and kind
of the values to be reduced, and returns a result of the same type
and kind.  That the result is of the same type and kind as the arguments
is implicit in the definition of the operation of REDUCE or CO_REDUCE.
It is also implicit in the algebraic definition of an operation.

Neither REDUCE nor CO_REDUCE say anything about which operand
is applied to the first argument of OPERATION or the second.
Also unmentioned is whether such a choice must be made consistently.
Because OPERATION need not have an OPERATOR interface,
the discussion in 7.1.6.1 about x_1 and x_2 is no help.  Also,
the discussion in 12.4.3.4.2 relating operands to dummy arguments
of functions is no help.

To clarify these order-of-evaluation issues, add a new section
to Claus 13, describing reduction operations.  There is also some
advantage to specifying the common aspects of REDUCE and CO_REDUCE
once rather than separately.

Also, it will be useful if REDUCE and CO_REDUCE have an ORDERED={T/F}
optional dummy arguments (absent = false) to specify whether
the ordered versus unordered reductions (described below) is to be
computed.

To specify how reduction operations work add a new subclaus to Claus 13,
perhaps after 13.2 [320:30+] or after 13.4 [322:16+] and Note 13.5.

"13.x Reduction Operations

13.x.1 Reduction Operands

A reduction operation applies a binary operation to all elements of a set
to produce a single result.  The elements of this set are called
operands and the set is called the operand set.  All elements of the set
have the same type and type parameters.

13.x.2 Default Values of Reduction Operations

The value of the reduction in the case where the operand set has zero
elements may be specified as an optional default value, or if none is
specified it may be the default initialization value of the type and
kind of the operands.  If there is no default initialization for the
type and kind of the operands, and if the type an intrinsic type,
the default value is zero for numeric types, false for logical types,
and zero-length character values for character types.  If the type
is a derived type, the above values are applied to the ultimate
components of the derived type.

13.x.4 Reduction Operantors

A reduction operation is specified by an operator function.  It is
a pure function taking two arguments of the type and type parameters
as the elements of the operand set and returning a result of the same
type and type parameters.  It need not have an OPERATOR interface.

13.x.4 Types of Reduction Operations

A reduction may be ordered or unordered.

13.x.4.1 Unordered Reductions

The operand set is considered an unordered set.  The processor selects
two distinct operands of the operand set, associates one chosen operand
with the first argument of the operation function
and associates the second chosen operand with the second argument
of the operation function.  The function is referenced and these operands
are removed from the operand set.  The result of the function reference
is returned to the operand set as a new operand.  The number of operands
in the operand set has thus been reduced by one.  When the operand set
has only one operand, its value is the result of the reduction.

13.x.4.2 Ordered Reductions

The operand set is considered an ordered set, with a unique integer
index value in the range 1 through N, where N is the number
of operands, associated with each operand.  The processor selects
two adjacent operands, with consecutive index values, from the
operand set.  These operands are removed from the set.  The chosen
operand with the lower index value is associated with the first
argument of the operation function, and the chosen operand
with the higher index value is associated with the second argument
of the operation function.  The function is referenced and these chosen
operands are removed from the operand set.  The function result
is returned to the operand set with an index value of either
of the arguments.  The number of operands in the operand set has thus
been reduced by one.  When there is only one operand remaining,
its value is the result of the reduction.

Above, "consecutive" means consecutive of the remaining index values.

Note 13.<some number>

An ordered reduction preserves the order of it operands,
and so is useful when the operation is not commutative.
An example of a useful non-commutative operation is a matrix
multiplication.

Note 13.<some number>+1

Some useful operations are mathematically associative
but not computationally associative.  Some useful operations are
computationally associative but not mathematically associative.
Some useful operations are neither mathematically associative nor
computationally associative.  The operation of a reduction
need not be associative.  Therefore, the applications
programmer is cautioned that results may not be reproducible
unless care is taken when defining the function that provides
the operation.  Non-associative operations are allowed because
some are useful, at the expense of allowing possibly non-reproducible
computations.  Different compilers, different optimization options
of the same compiler, different revisions of the same compiler,
and different hardware may produce different values
if the chosen operation is not associative."

{update the reduce entry in Table 13.1}

[324:(about half way down the page)]
replace the REDUCE arguments with
"(ARRAY, OPERATION, DIM [, MASK, IDENTITY, ORDERED])" or
(ARRAY, OPERATION [, MASK, IDENTITY, ORDERED])"

{update the entries for reduce arguments in 13.7.140}

[383:38] after "of any type." add a sentence
"The operand set consists of the elements of the array,
taken in array element order."

[384:1-4] replace the current OPERATION specification with
"OPERATION shall be a function meeting the requirements
           of 13.x.4 Reduction Operantors"

{update case-i}

[384:12-17] replace the current text with
"Case (i): The result of REDUCE( ARRAY, OPERATION [, IDENTITY =
           IDENTITY, ORDERED = ORDERED] is the result
           of an reduction operation where the operand set
           consists of the elements of the array and the operation is
           specified by the OPERANTION function.  If ORDERED is
           present with the value TRUE, it is an ordered reduction
           13.x.4.2 Ordered Reductions.  Otherwise, it is
           an unordered reduction 13.x.4.1 Unordered Reductions.
           If present, IDENTITY provides the default value when there
           are no elements in the operand set as specified
           by 13.x.2 Default Values of Reduction Operations."

and are associated with arguments of the operation function
when computing an unorderd reduction"
