Subject: Specification expressions that are not constant

Discussion:

The discussion of lower and upper cobounds in the subclause describing
the codimension attribute omit the case of a coarray declared in a
block construct and incorrectly suggests explicit-coshape coarrays can
be components. BLOCK had also not been integrated into the similar
constraint for explicit-shape arrays. Finally, the wording for when
specification expressions are evaluated differs between the
description of automatic objects and explicit-shape arrays. Fixes are
provided.

------------

Edit to 09-007r2:

[88:37] In paragraph 2 of "5.2.2 Automatic data objects", after
"<entity-decl>" add " for a local variable of a subprogram or BLOCK
construct".

[88:38-39] In paragraph 2 of "5.2.2 Automatic data objects", replace
"the procedure or BLOCK construct" with "a procedure defined by the
subprogram, or on execution of the BLOCK statement,".

[92:23] In the second constraint (C529) in "5.3.6.3 Explicit-coshape
coarray", replace "derived type definition" with "BLOCK construct".

[92:24-26] In the third paragraph in "5.3.6.3 Explicit-coshape
coarray" make these two changes:

Replace the first sentence with:

"If an explicit-coshape coarray is a local variable of a procedure or
BLOCK construct and has cobounds that are not constant expressions,
the cobounds are determined at entry to the procedure, or on execution of
the BLOCK statement, by evaluating the cobounds' expressions."

At the end of the second sentence, after "procedure" add "or BLOCK
construct".

[94:16] In the first constraint (C531) of "5.3.8.2 Explicit-shape
array", after "definition, " add "BLOCK construct, ".
