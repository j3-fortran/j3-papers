Subject: Abstract interfaces are unnecessary
Date: 28 February 2002

Section 1 Introduction

Abstract interfaces are unnecessary.  You may recall that abstract
interfaces were introduced to give explicit interfaces to procedure
pointers, and later used to give explicit interfaces to deferred
type-bound procedure bindings.

Presumably, the reason to invent abstract interfaces was so as not to
require a procedure of the same name as the interface to be a part of the
program. It is, however, explicitly contemplated in the second paragraph
of C.9.3 that one should be allowed to have interfaces for procedures
that are not part of the program:

  A scoping unit is allowed to contain an interface body for a procedure
  that does not exist in the program, provided the procedure described is
  never referenced.  The purpose of this rule is to allow implementations
  in which the use of a module providing interface bodies describing the
  interface of every routine in a library would not automatically cause
  each of those library routines to be a part of the program referencing
  the module.  Instead, only those library procedures actually referenced
  would be a part of the program....

Therefore, it would be possible simply to use ordinary interface bodies,
in ordinary interface blocks, to provide the explicit interfaces needed
for procedure pointers and deferred type-bound procedure bindings.  One
could in fact go farther, and allow any entity with an explicit interface
to provide interfaces for those entities.

This proposal depends on the proposal, in 02-107r1 or its successors,
that makes interface bodies local entities.
