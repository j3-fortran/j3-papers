Introduction 
------------ 

Paper 19-132 proposes allowing a binary, octal or hexadecimal (BOZ)
constant in contexts where an integer-literal-constant is currently
allowed. Use cases include in initialization expressions,
constructors, enumerators, logical expressions, and case selectors.
Currently, BOZ-constants are allowed only as data-stmt-constants in
DATA statements, or as arguments to a limited number of intrinsic
functions. As noted in the paper, the INT intrinsic function may be
used with a BOZ constant argument in these use cases. The proposal
allows a user to skip calling INT with the BOZ constant argument and
merely use the BOZ constant in place of the INT intrinsic call.

Discussion
---------- 
Subgroup notes that many vendors actually already support extensions
that allow BOZ-constants to be used in contexts where
integer-constants are allowed.  Testing various compilers show the
following results:

     Cray  gfortran* IBM  Intel  NAG  PGI
  a)  Y       Y       Y     Y     Y    Y
  b)  Y       Y       Y     Y     Y    N 
  c)  Y       Y       Y     N     Y    Y
  d)  Y       Y       Y     Y     Y    Y
  e)  Y       Y       Y     Y     N    Y

  where a) is initialization expressions, b) is constructors, c) is
  enumerators,  d) is logical expressions, and e) is case selectors.

  *  gfortran compiled with the -fno-range-check

BOZ constants are semantically different from integer constants.  An 
integer argument to the intrinsic function REAL results in a type 
conversion of the integer representation of the value of the argument
to the real representation of that value.  A BOZ constant argument to 
the REAL intrinsic function is essentially a TRANSFER function call, 
which moves the internal representation of the value of the constant 
into a result type of REAL without doing an integer to real conversion.

Most compilers already provide extensions that perform this bit
transfer to a real target without the use of REAL(). As an example,
the test program

real(8)    :: r = z"4046800000000000"
integer(8) :: i = z"4046800000000000"
print *, r, i
end

compiles with multiple compilers and produces the equivelent of 

> ./a.out
 45.,  4631530004285489152

as output. (The hex constant z"4046800000000000" is the internal
floating point representation of 45.).

Subgroup is concerned allowing BOZ constants as integer constants would
be confusing to users given this semantic difference.

At this time, the BIT data-type proposal is still being considered as
a feature for the next revision of the standard.  If the BIT data-type
proposal moves forward, the proposwd change in 19-132 is not longer
needed.

Subgroup recommends no further action on paper 19-132.
