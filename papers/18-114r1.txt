For consideration.

Basic Functionality
===================

Provide for definition of enumeration types, not just names for
C-interoperable integer named constants.

Rationale
=========

Enumerators are sufficiently useful that we added them, but in a
crippled form suitable only for C interoperability.

Enumeration types could be used for generic resolution, argument and
result type safety for procedure reference, and array bounds.  Actual  |
arguments and subscripts of enumeration types would be known apriori   |
(at compile time) to have in-range values.                             |

Estimated Impact on Standard
============================

Minor to moderate.

Detailed Specification
======================

Specify syntax to define enumeration types and their enumerators.

The type definition specifies whether enumerators are ordered or
unordered.  Unordered enumerators are not significantly different from
named integer constants or BIND(C) enums, and therefore might not be
sufficiently useful.

An enumeration type definition may specify a kind type parameter value.
This is not a kind type parameter that may be specified differently in
the declarations of objects of the type, because the enumeration type
definition declares objects that are its enumerators.  If an enumeration
type is parameterized, the parameter specifies the kind of integer that
represents the numeric values of its enumerators, and all variables of
the type.  Whether the kind is otherwise default integer, or processor
dependent, can be decided in due course.  Polymorphism might require to
standardize the kind if no kind type parameter is specified.
Alternatives are a non-extensibility attribute, or prohibiting extension
if a kind type parameter value is not specified and the kind in that
case is processor dependent, which would allow a processor to choose a
representation smaller than default integer, for example eight bits,
without fear that enumerators of an extension would require more bits.

An enumeration type definition can specify an accessibility attribute,
which applies to the type name.

An enumeration type that is not an extension type can be declared to be
interoperable using the BIND(C) attribute.  If a kind type parameter
value is specified, it shall be one that is specified in Table 18.2 in
17-007r2.

Type-bound procedures are not proposed.

Example:

  ENUMERATION, ORDERED :: T
    ENUMERATOR :: RED, ORANGE, YELLOW, GREEN, BLUE
  END ENUMERATION T

An ordered enumeration type is extensible.  The extension type includes
the enumerators of its parent.  An enumerator of an extension type
cannot have the same name as an enumerator of its parent type.  An
extension type is interoperable if and only if its parent type is
interoperable.  The extension type has the same kind type parameter
value as the parent type, and the kind cannot be specified in its
definition.

The usual type compatibility rules concerning type extension apply,
except that a nonpolymorphic expression of ancestor type may be assigned
to a polymorphic or nonpolymorphic variable of descendant type.
Assignment is not a problem because all enumerators of an ancestor type
are also enumerators of a descendant type.

Example:

  ENUMERATION, EXTENDS(T) :: U ! U is an ordered enumeration type
    ENUMERATOR :: ULTRAVIOLET, XRAY, GAMMA
  END ENUMERATION U

An enumerator of enumeration type is a literal constant that is an
object of that type.  An accessibility attribute may be specified for
enumerators.  Whether a default accessibility attribute may be
specified, as can be done for derived type component declarations, can
be decided in due course.

If an enumeration type name is accessed by use association, all its
public enumerators are also accessible, and their local names are the
same as their declared names.  If an enumerator is accessed by use
association with ONLY, its type name is also accessible, but enumerators
that are not accessed by use association are not accessible.  It might
be useful to provide a syntax of use association that specifies whether
only an enumeration type name is accessible, or the type name and its
enumerators are accessible.

Example:

  USE M, ONLY: T   ! Only the type name is accessible
  USE M, ONLY: T() ! The type name and enumerator names are accessible

Enumerators of enumeration types can be renamed during use association.

The declared type of a data object of enumeration type can be specified
using the ordinary type declaration syntax, i.e., TYPE(<type-name>) ::
<object-name> or CLASS(<type-name>) :: <object-name>.  A kind type
parameter cannot be specified in the declaration of an object of
enumeration type; it is specified only by the type definition.

Objects of BIND(C) enumeration types cannot appear in EQUIVALENCE.

A numeric sequence type may have components of an enumeration type with
default integer kind.

A numeric value may be specified for any enumerator of an unordered
enumeration type.  If a numeric value is not specified for the first
enumerator of an unordered enumeration type, its numeric value is zero.
It is possible for two enumerators of an unordered enumeration type to
have the same numeric representation.

A numeric value may be specified for the first enumerator of an ordered
enumeration type that is not an extension type.  Otherwise, the numeric
value of the first enumerator of an ordered enumeration type, that is
not an extension, is zero.  The numeric value of the first enumerator of
an ordered enumeration type, that is an extension, is one more than the
numeric value of the last enumerator of the parent type.

The numeric value of an enumerator of an ordered enumeration type, other
than the first one, cannot be specified; it is one more than the value
of the previously declared enumerator of that type.

The numeric value of an enumerator of an unordered enumeration type for
which a numeric value is not specified, other than the first one, is one
more than the value of the previously declared enumerator of that type.

The numeric value of an enumerator shall be representable by an integer
of the kind specified or implied by the declaration of its type.  This
might cause an extension definition to fail.

The numeric value of an enumerator or object of enumeration type may be
inquired using the INT intrinsic function.

An object of ordered enumeration type may be an actual argument in a
reference to the intrinsic function TINY.  The result value is the first
enumerator of the declared type of that object (which includes all
enumerators of all ancestor types).  The value of a variable of an
ordered enumeration type might be less than the result of TINY with that
variable as an argument, if its type is an extension, because every
enumerator of a parent enumeration type is an enumerator of all of its
extension types.

An object of ordered enumeration type may be an actual argument in a
reference to the intrinsic function HUGE.  Its value is the last
enumerator of the dynamic type of that object.

Definition of an ordered enumeration type defines an elemental
constructor function of the same name.  An actual argument shall be an
integer expression, an enumerator of the same declared type, or a
variable of the same declared type.  The value of an integer argument
shall be within the range of numeric representations of enumerators of
the specified type.  References to the constructor function may appear
in constant expressions, provided their arguments are constant
expressions.  A function with the same generic name as the type is
allowed, provided it is distinguishable from the constructor, but it
cannot appear in constant expressions.

Definition of an unordered enumeration type defines an elemental
constructor function of the same name.  The argument shall be an
enumerator of the same declared type or a variable of the same declared
type.  An integer argument is not allowed because there might be numeric
values between the smallest and largest numeric representations of
enumerators of the type that do not represent enumerators of the type.
References to the constructor function may appear in constant
expressions, provided their arguments are constant expressions. A
function with the same generic name as the type is allowed, provided it
is distinguishable from the constructor, but it cannot appear in
constant expressions.

Enumerators are local identifiers in class (1) in subclause 19.3.1 of
17-007r2.  An enumerator of an enumeration type may have the same name
as an enumerator of a different ordered enumeration type that is not an
ancestor type.  If several enumerators having the same name are
accessible, the can appear only as arguments to constuctors of their
types.

Example:

  ENUMERATION, ORDERED :: COLORS
    ENUMERATOR :: WHITE, BROWN, GREEN
  END ENUMERATION COLORS

  ENUMERATION, ORDERED :: NAMES
    ENUMERATOR :: GREEN, BROWN, WHITE
  END ENUMERATION NAMES

  NAMES(GREEN) is a value of type NAMES.  COLORS(GREEN) is a value of
  type COLORS.  Their numeric representations are different.  GREEN
  alone is prohibited because its type is ambiguous.

An object of enumeration type may have any attribute allowed for data
objects of other types.

The name of an ordered enumeration type may be used to specify the
bounds of an array dimension or the cobounds of a coarray codimension,
either in a declaration or an <allocation>.  An enumerator of an ordered
enumeration type may be used to specify the upper bound of an array
dimension or cobound of a coarray codimension , either in a declaration
or an <allocation>.  Two enumerators of an ordered enumeration type may
be used, with colon notation, to specify the bounds of an array
dimension or the cobounds of a coarray codimension, either in a
declaration or an <allocation>.  If the upper bound precedes the lower
bound in the definition of the bounds' type, the extent in that
dimension is zero.  The upper cobound shall not precede the lower
cobound.

If colon notation is not used, the effect is as if the lower bound or
cobound were specified by reference to the intrinsic function TINY with
an object of the type of the bounds or cobounds as its actual argument.

If bounds or cobounds are specified using an ordered enumeration type
name, or by a range of enumerators, a subscript or cosubscript for that
dimension or codimension, including a subscript in a section subscript,
shall be a nonpolymorphic expression of the same type.  If <stride>
appears, it shall be nonzero and of integer type.  If the lower
subscript is omitted, it is as if it were specified by reference to the
intrinsic function TINY with an object of the type of the bounds as its
actual argument.  If the upper subscript is omitted, it is as if it were
specified by reference to the intrinsic function HUGE with a
nonpolymorphic object of the type of the bounds as its actual argument.
If the bound or cobound is specified by an ordered enumeration type name
that is not an extension type, the value of a nonpolymorphic subscript
or cosubscript of that declared type is necessarily within the bounds of
that dimension or codimension because it must be a value of that type.
Subscript bounds checking has no runtime cost, provided the result value
of a constructor is checked, and the value of a variable of enumeration
type read by unformatted input is checked if numeric representation is
used for unformatted input/output.

A <do-variable>, <ac-do-variable>, or <data-i-do-variable> may be a
nonpolymorphic variable of an ordered enumeration type.  The first and
second expressions in the loop control shall be specified by
nonpolymorphic expressions of that type.  If the third expression
appears, it shall be nonzero and of integer type.  An <index-name> may
be a nonpolymorphic variable of an ordered enumeration type.  The first
and second <concurrent-limit> expressions shall be specified by
nonpolymorphic expressions of that type.  If <concurrent-step> appears,
it shall be nonzero and of integer type.

The intrinsic function KIND may be used to inquire the kind of integer
used to represent a value of an enumeration type.

The only intrinsic operations defined for objects of unordered
enumeration types are equality and inequality.  All numeric relational
operations are defined for objects of ordered enumeration types, using
the numeric representations of the objects.  The operands shall be of
the same declared type, or the type of one shall be an extension of the
type of the other.  No other intrinsic operations are provided for
objects of enumeration types.

Assignment and operations may be defined for enumeration types.

A <case-expr> in SELECT CASE may be a scalar expression of ordered
enumeration type.  A <case-value> in a CASE statement shall be a scalar
constant expression of the same declared type if <case-expr> is not
polymorphic, or may be of an extension type if <case-expr> is
polymorphic.

Elemental intrinsic functions shall provide the successor and
predecessor objects of values of ordered enumeration types.  Whether the
successor (predecessor) of the last (first) value is the first (last)
value, or an error, or an undefined value, can be decided in due course.

Formatted input and output of values of enumeration types shall be
provided, using the local names of the enumerators.  Whether the "A"
format descriptor is used, or a new edit descriptor is defined, can be
decided in due course.  Input shall not be case sensitive.  Case of
output could be specified by the standard or processor dependent, but a
changeable mode to specify the case (upper case, lower case, or the case
in the type definition or renaming in use association) would be
preferable.  Unformatted input and output of values of enumeration types
shall be provided.  Whether numeric or text representation is used can
be decided in due course, or might be processor dependent.

If an object of enumeration type is an actual argument, the referenced
procedure shall have explicit interface.  If a procedure has a dummy
argument of enumeration type, its interface shall be explicit where it
is referenced.  Existing rules for argument type compatibility are
reversed because the value of an actual argument that is of an extension
of the type of the dummy argument might not be an enumerator of the
dummy argument type.

One example of use is to identify exceptions in the proposal for       |
block-structured exception handling as described in 18-115.            |
                                                                       |
One reason for the EXCEPTION type described therein to be an ordered   |
enumeration type is that, at least for user-defined exceptions, one    |
might wish to group actions in the handler to print different          |
auxiliary descriptive data.  This could be done using a SELECT CASE    |
construct, but range tests in an IF construct might be clearer and     |
more efficient (but who cares about efficiency in an exception         |
handler?).                                                             |

C-interoperable ENUM values, or integer named constants, can be        |
converted to enumerators of an unordered enumeration type in the       |
definition of the type and the declarations of its enumerators.  For   |
example:                                                               |

  use HDF, only: Dfacc_Create, Dfacc_Rdonly, Dfacc_Rdrw                |
  enumeration, unordered :: HDF_Actions                                |
    enumerator :: Create = Dfacc_Create                                |
    enumerator :: Readonly = Dfacc_Rdonly                              |
    enumerator :: Rdrw = Dfacc_Rdrw                                    |
  end enumeration HDF_Actions                                          |
                                                                       |
The type HDF_Actions could be used for generic resolution.  Arguments  |
of type HDF_Actions would be known to be valid values; it would not    |
be necessary to check their values at run time.                        |

The catalog is represented by a rank-one array of objects of derived   |

type name to specify bounds is not provided:                           |

Elements of the catalog could be processed by a loop:                  |
                                                                       |

    call process_spectroscopy_catalog ( catalog(the_molecule) )        |
  end do                                                               |

This guarantees that the subscript of Catalog, the actual argument     |
to Process_Spectroscopy_Catalog, is within the bounds of the array,    |
even after the program is deployed with maximum optimization turned on |
and runtime subscript bounds checking turned off.                      |
