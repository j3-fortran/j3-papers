Discussion

The sentence at the end of Note 2.10 (top of page 26) : "Though it is
simpler to implement co-arrays on a set of identical CPUs, such a
configuration is not required." seems to be more misleading than
clarifying.

Edits to J3/07-007r2

[26:1--] In 2.4.2 Program execution, delete the last sentence of
Note 2.10.
