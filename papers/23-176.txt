Subject: C interoperability for new interchange floating-point types
Date: 2023-June-12
Reference: 22-185r1

1. Introduction
===============

The ISO C23 specification is expected to ratify support for
extended floating point types, specifically, 16-bit, 32-bit,
64-bit, and 128-bit real numbers [1,2].

These types should be added to C-Fortran interoperability features
so that Fortran's REAL16 and REAL128 types (and their complex
counterparts) can be used in a C-interoperable context.
For completeness, we also add support for the C23 types _Float32,
_Float64 and their complex counterparts, although these are
expected to be synonymous with C float and double in most cases.

This change is proposed for Fortran 202Y.

2 . Proposal
============

In 18.2.2 Named constants and derived types in the module, change

"The values of C_FLOAT, C_DOUBLE, and C_LONG_DOUBLE shall each ... 
The values of C_FLOAT_COMPLEX, C_DOUBLE_COMPLEX, and C_LONG_DOUBLE_COMPLEX
shall be the same as those of C_FLOAT, C_DOUBLE, and C_LONG_DOUBLE,
respectively."

to

"The values of C_FLOAT16, C_FLOAT, C_FLOAT32, C_DOUBLE, C_FLOAT64,
C_LONG_DOUBLE and C_FLOAT128 shall each ... The values of 
C_FLOAT16_COMPLEX, C_FLOAT_COMPLEX, C_FLOAT32_COMPLEX,
C_DOUBLE_COMPLEX, C_FLOAT64_COMPLEX, C_LONG_DOUBLE_COMPLEX 
and C_FLOAT128_COMPLEX shall be the same as those of C_FLOAT16, 
C_FLOAT, C_DOUBLE, C_LONG_DOUBLE, and C_FLOAT128 respectively."

In Table 18.2: Interoperability between Fortran and C types, change

3 . Discussion
==============

The omission of a second underscore in the Fortran names is intentional.
The leading underscore in C names exists due to how C reserves names
and is not a descriptive part of the name.
