1. The problem

Classify the possibilities of procedure designators with % in them
according to the following matrix.

       A                   B
   1 polymorphic      not polymorphic
   2 subobject of     whole object
   3 procedure ptr    type-bound procedure

Assume THIS_IMAGE() == 1

Notation: 1b2b3b = pick B from row 1, pick B from row 2, pick C from row 3;
                 = "not polymorphic" + "whole object" + "type-bound proc".

Item 1.
1b2b3b call x[3]%reset == call reset ( x[3] )
       Might look a little like RPC but the brackets are in the wrong
       place, not really ....  Compile-time resolved to a procedure.  NAP.

[NAP = Not A Problem].

Item 2.
1b2b3a call x[3]%procptr
       Problematic.  Could be performance problem.  Best solution might be
       an indirection table ... and that could require changes in linker
       and dynamic loader.  Does UPC have this feature?  (It's not clear
       from their spec.)

Item 3.
1b2a3b call x[3]%y%sum = call sum ( x[3]%y )
       Same as 1.  NAP

Item 4a.
1a2b3b+alloc
       call px[3]%reset == call "slot7 of px.dispatch" ( px[3] )
       NAP because type of PX is same on all images.  Same as 1.

Item 4d.
1a2b3b+dummy
       call px[3]%reset ! px is a dummy arg coarray
       NAP -- same type every image.  See 2.5.7p5.

Item 5.
1a2a3b call x[3]%px%sum == call "slot3 of x[3]%px.dispatch" ( x[3]%px )
       Problematic like 2 if type of x%px is defined in a module in a DLL.
       Ask image 3 for type of px.  But the type information tables might
       be at a different address on image 1.  Best solution might be a type
       indirection table in addition to a procedure indirection table.

1b2a3a same as 2

1a2b3a same as 2

1a2a3a same as 2

Items 2 and 5 are the only problems.  The other items are generally useful
functionality that is worth preserving.

2. Edits:

[157:7.2.2.2 C728]------------------------------------------------------
Editor:  Replace C728 by
"C728 (R741) The <scalar-variable> shall be a <data-ref> that is not a
             coindexed object."
{Exclude case 2.}

[285:12.5.1 C1229+] Insert new constraint
  "C1229a (R1221) <data-ref> shall not be a polymorphic subobject of a
                  coindexed object."
{Exclude case 5.}

[286:12.5.1 Note 12.16] Delete note (now moot).
