Introduction
============

To reduce surprises, especially for newcomers to Fortran, it would be
helpful if facilities that have similar purposes had similar details.

The example under attention here is associate names of ASSOCIATE
constructs.

The relationship between selectors and associate names in ASSOCIATE
constructs was consciously modeled on the relationship between actual
and dummy arguments.

An unexpected difference is that an allocatable actual argument can
correspond to an allocatable dummy argument, and a pointer actual
argument can correspond to a pointer dummy argument, but an associate
name never has the ALLOCATABLE or POINTER attribute.  Unlike a dummy
argument, there is at present no way to attach either the ALLOCATABLE or
POINTER attribute to an associate name.

An effect of this is that the associate name cannot be allocated or
deallocated, the allocation of an associate name cannot be moved, and
the pointer association status of an associate name cannot be nullified,
even if the selector is allocatable or a pointer.  An associate name
cannot be the target of a pointer assignment unless the selector has the
POINTER or TARGET attribute.  Unlike a dummy argument, there is at
present no way to attach the TARGET attribute to an associate name.

Proposal
========

Extend the similarity of the relationship of associate names to
selectors, to be more like the relationship between dummy and actual
arguments.

Allow at least a limited form of <block-specification-part> that can
specify the ALLOCATABLE or POINTER attribute for an associate name,
which, if it appears, shall correspond to the attribute of the selector.

Whether it should be allowed to specify the TARGET attribute for an
associate name independently of whether the selector has the attribute,
with the same caveats that apply to actual and dummy arguments, deserves
more discussion.  It might subvert optimizers.  One way to make it
reasonable is to specify that any pointers that appear in a pointer
association context, that might be involved with associate names, become
undefined (even better, nullified) when execution of the construct
completes.  This would include the case of a pointer actual argument
corresponding to a dummy argument that is not known to have INTENT(IN).

More generally, allow a <block-specification-part> in an ASSOCIATE
construct, with the restriction that the only attribute that can be
specified for an associate name is the ALLOCATABLE or POINTER attribute
(and maybe the TARGET attribute).
