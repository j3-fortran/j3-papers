~~~~~~~~~~

Fortran 2018 makes RECURSIVE the default for regular functions; it
seems to be intended that the restriction that a RECURSIVE function
cannot be ELEMENTAL was removed (C1245 in 10-007r1). However, this
feature addition is not mentioned in the introduction.

Edit to N2146
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On page xix, in the bullet headed "Program units and procedures:",
after "the RECURSIVE keyword is advisory only" add
", and ELEMENTAL procedures can be invoked recursively"
