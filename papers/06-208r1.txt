Subject: C_LOC and contiguous arrays

Specification:
____________________

The proposed edits for the CONTIGUOUS attribute (see J3/05-273r2) 
introduce the concept of a contiguous array but do not complete the 
integration process with C Interop. 

In particular, C_LOC should be extended to return the base address of (run-time) 
contiguous array pointer or assumed-shape array (edits below).

Edits:
____________________

[475:22] In the first list in the description of the argument to
C_LOC (15.2.3.5), replace item (b) "an allocated allocatable variable
that has the TARGET  attribute and is not an array of zero size, or"
with new item:

(b) "A contiguous object that has the TARGET attribute and is not an 
array of zero size, or"
