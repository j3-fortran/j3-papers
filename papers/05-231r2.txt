This paper attempts to provide edits to implement the detailed specification
of the enhanced stop item, viz

Detailed Specification:

(1) The stop code shall be allowed to be a scalar initialization expression
    of type default integer or default character.
(2) Recommend that the stop code be displayed on ERROR_UNIT.
(3) Recommend that if the stop code is of integer type, it should be used as
    the process exit status (if the processor even has such a concept).
(4) Note that the processor might use only a portion of such a stop code for
    the exit status.

Edits: pertain to section 8.4 STOP Statement page 170 of 04-007

[170:22-23]
Change R850 to
"<stop-code> <<is>> <scalar-default-character-initialization-expression>
             <<or>> <scalar-default-integer-initialization-expression>"

[170:24] delete C834

[170:26-27]
In the following paragraph, delete the second sentence
"Leading zero digits in the stop code are not significant."

[170:29+]
Add two Notes following the paragraph:
        "Note 8.21+ When the <stop-code> is an integer,
         it is recommended that the value be used
         as the process exit status,
         if the operating system supports that concept.
         If the integer <stop-code> is used as the process
         exit status, the operating system might be able
         to interpret only values within a limited range,
         or only a limited portion of the integer value
         (for example, only the least-significant 8 bits)."

        "Note 8.21++  The 'processor-dependent manner'
         by which a <stop-code> is made available is
         recommended to be by means of formatted output
         to the processor-dependent external unit
         identified by the named constant ERROR_UNIT
         of the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module (Section 9.4)."
