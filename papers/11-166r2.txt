Subject: Interop TR: second part of notes on type(*) - example A.1.5
Date: 2011 June 1th
Reference: N1854, N1820


There has been a great deal of cross-purposes discussion on many aspects
that come down to people not closely involved in this group
misunderstanding the purpose and intent of type(*).

Arising from this, I still think that example A.1.5 is a really, but
REALLY, bad idea.  Yes, it is possible, but it doesn't even mention the
legion of restrictions, 'gotchas' and even ambiguities that it brings
in.  My main concern is that it will encourage some of the more
knuckle-dragging but intelligent programmers to start using it as a way
of implementing a form of dynamic EQUIVALENCE (and not just for the
Fortran 77 types, either) and - heaven help us! - propagating that view
on the Web, in 'bulletin boards' and even in books.  But perhaps I am
being too cynical ....

Since first writing this, I have reread N1820, and the example actually
conflicts with constraint 2!  Since that document was the formalisation
of the consensus arising from a lot of discussion, we shouldn't include
such an example lightly.
