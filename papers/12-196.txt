F08/0040   MOVE_ALLOC for coarrays

  Bob Corbett's Yes with Comment vote on F08/0040:

    The answer says "the coranks of FROM and TO need to be the same."
    The discussion says "the dummy arguments of MOVE_ALLOC do not
    technically have corank."  I think I understand how both statements
    can be true, but it did confuse me at first.  I suggest eliding the
    statement from the discussion.

  Bill Long's Yes with Comment vote on F08/0040:

    In the first edit, the edit instructions begin:

      [97:13] In 5.3.10 INTENT attribute,

    However, when the [page:line] is removed for the corrigendum, the
    subsequent instructions will be ambiguous since the section contains
    multiple instances of "entity".  The other edits have instructions
    that are complete enough to omit the [page:line]. Seems better to
    do the same for the first one. Something like

      [97:13] In 5.3.10 INTENT attribute, constraint C541,

  John Reid's Yes with Comment vote on F08/0040:

    The edit for 5.3.10 should be
      [97:13] In 5.3.10 INTENT attribute, C541,
        Change "An entity"
        to "A dummy argument of a nonintrinsic procedure".

  Result: Accept John's and Bob's changes.  F08/0040 passes as amended.


************************************************************************

F08/0074   Implicit type in BLOCK construct

  Van Snyder's Yes with Comment vote on F08/0074:

    In the question, in the first line after the sample program,
    remove "the" before "X", or insert "variable" before "X".

  Result: No edit is needed.  "the x inside the BLOCK construct" in the
          existing edit uniquely identifies the x being asked about.
          F08/0074 passes with no changes.

F08/0075   Pointer function reference as variable in assignment

  Daniel Chen's No vote on F08/0075

    I agree with Malcolm. 

  Bob Corbett's No vote on F08/0075:

    I am happy with the answer given, although I think the edit can be
    simplified.  I am voting "no" because I think we should consider
    other possible solutions.  I think the suggestion made by Rafik
    Zurob during meeting 198 deserves further consideration.  He
    suggested requiring an <expr> used as a variable to be a function
    reference.  That cannot be done in a blanket fashion without
    breaking compatibility with Fortran 2003.  However, I think it can
    be done if exceptions are made for a few cases.

  Bill Long's Yes with Comment vote on F08/0075:

    The edit is faulty.  I assume that "label" should follow the second
    "statement" in the Edit.  So the edit ends "... that is not part of
    a statement label shall not be a digit."  If this assumption is
    incorrect, then my vote is No, since I don't understand the current
    edit text.

    Minor: EDITS: -> EDIT:  (since there is only one).

  Malcolm Cohen's No vote on F08/0075:
 
    (Note that the edit is wrong - missing 'label' after the second
     statement - but that is not the reason for voting NO.)
 
    Even though a '.ADDRESS.' operator might look 'cool', I have come
    to the conclusion that allowing operator syntax to denote variables
    is a mistake. The standard has various restrictions on operators to
    reduce the ability to obfuscate your code, e.g. arguments are
    required to be INTENT(IN).  The purpose of operator syntax was to
    allow user-defined algebra, not junk coding.
 
    There is no functionality provided by this feature that is not
    adequately served, with less obfuscation, by function reference
    syntax.
 
    The correct fix for this interp is to acknowledge our mistake in
    permitting this syntax to occur at all anywhere, and changing R602
    and C602 to
 
      R602 variable is designator or function-reference
 
      C602 (R602) function-reference shall have a data pointer result.
 
    Note that a less extreme viewpoint would be to allow the operator
    syntax except as the variable in an assignment statement (or READ
    statement). That would be a better solution than the nitpicky syntax
    tweaks that are the current proposed solutions to this interp and
    the next, but would not be as consistent as disallowing this
    problematic syntax entirely.

  Bob Corbett's comment on Malcolm's vote:

    Rafix Zurob's proposal in meeting 199 was similar to this proposal.
    The problem we identified then was that the change made in Fortran
    2008 has been integrated into the standard in more than one place.
    For example, in Fortran 2003, the statement

      P => Q + 1

    where the operation Q + 1 returns a pointer to a data object is
    permitted.  If only the change suggested is made, that statement
    will not be permitted in Fortran 2008.  There are decisions that
    will have to be made regarding the ASSOCIATE and SELECT TYPE
    statements.

    I think you mean 'the edit suggested'... as my suggested change was
    to remove the operator syntax for denoting variables that was added
    in F2008.  In F2003, Q+1 does not denote a variable, in fact quite
    the opposite, it returns a 'pointer association'.  This is not required
    to denote a variable!
 
    <<<
       that statement will not be permitted in Fortran 2008.
    >>>
 
    Right, it would be a mistake to introduce that incompatibility.  I was
    not suggesting making that mistake.
 
    It looks to me like F2008 has another mistake here already, since Q+1
    is permitted to return a null pointer, and this definitively does not
    denote any variable!
 
    I accept that my initial suggested edits are not complete.  However,
    there are relatively few places in the language that count as 'pointer
    context', so it will not be onerous to check that these will all be ok
    (but I didn't do that before making my interp ballot comment).
 
    <<< 
 
       There are decisions that will have to be made regarding the

    There are decisions to be made full stop.  I do not see any particular
    reason to treat associate selectors that are expressions differently
    from any other expressions though.

  Toon Moene's No vote on F08/0075:

    I agree with Malcolm's analysis why F08/0075 is wrong and couldn't
    possibly have worded it better.

  John Reid's No vote on F08/0075:

    I agree with Malcolm

F08/0076   Pointer function reference in READ

  Daniel Chen's No vote on F08/0075

    I agree with Malcolm. 

  Bob Corbett's No vote on F08/0076:

    My comments for F08/0075 also apply here.

  Malcolm Cohen's No vote on F08/0076:
 
    This should also be fixed by removing this particular syntax
    (operators) for the feature (pointer function reference as variable).
    Or at the very least, removing it from the READ statement.

  Toon Moene's No vote on F08/0076:

    I agree with Malcolm's analysis why F08/0076 is wrong and couldn't
    possibly have worded it better.

  John Reid's No vote on F08/0076:

    I agree with Malcolm

  Result: This is another instance of the same problem (syntactic
          ambiguity) caused by the same feature (operator syntax
          for variable denotation) as F08/0075, so needs to be
          answered together with F08/0075, => example will be added to
          F08/0075, and F08/0076 is therefore subsumed by F08/0075.

F08/0077   Function references as variables in DATA statements

  Bob Corbett's Yes with Comment vote on F08/0077:

    Changes to the resolution of F08/0075 and F08/0076 might have an
    effect on the edits given here.

  Van Snyder's No vote on F08/0077:

    Since the only alternatives for <variable> are <designator>
    and <expr>, it seems weird to have <variable> in the syntax
    rule, and then a constraint that says it is required to be
    <designator>, not <expr>.

    If it works, I would prefer to change the first alternative of
    R536 at [104:15] from <variable> to <designator>, and then use
    <designator> instead of <variable> in C566 at [104:26] and
    C568 at [104:32].  A change would also be required in C567 at
    [104:28-29], to something like "A <designator> that appears ...
    shall not designate a variable that is a dummy argument...."

    If for some reason that doesn't work, I accept the proposed repair.

  Malcolm Cohen's comments on Van's comments:

    >    Since the only alternatives for <variable> are <designator>

    >    If for some reason that doesn't work,

    Obviously doesn't work because a <designator> is not necessarily
    a <variable>.

    Use of <variable> with
      Cxxx The <variable> shall be a <designator>.

    is not obviously worse than use of of <designator> with
      Cxxx The <designator> shall not be a constant or a subobject of
           a constant.

    > accept the proposed repair.

    I am somewhat boggled that this warrants voting NO with a comment
    that if your variation on the fix doesn't work (as it doesn't out
    of the box) then you vote YES (I presume that's what "accept the
    proposed repair" means).

    Surely more appropriate to vote "C" saying you prefer alternative
    fix, ne?

  Van's response to Malcolm:

    OK, I overlooked the necessity to duplicate C601.  Instead of the
    proposed repair, an alternative is to add a syntax rule, instead
    of a constraint that says "you can only choose the first alternative
    for the syntax rule in this circumstance:"

    [6.2 117:12-14]
      R602 <variable> <<is>> <variable-designator>
                      <<or>> <expr>

      R602a <variable-designator> <<is>> <designator>

      C601 (R602a) <designator> shall not be a constant or a subobject
                   of a constant

    and move C602 above R602a, since it continues to apply to R602.

    Then in R536 use <variable-designator> instead of <variable>, and
    make the corresponding changes in the related constraints.

  Result: F08/0077 passes with no changes.

F08/0078   Are the IEEE values +0 and -0 distinguished

  Bob Corbett's No vote on F08/0078:

    I disagree with the interpretation.  I think that the distinction
    between +0 and -0 is such an important component of IEC 60559:1989
    that it should be required if IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE is true.

  Result: F08/0078 passes with no changes.

F08/0079   NAMELIST and type specification

  Daniel Chen's No vote on F08/0079:

  There are typos in the example as Bill indicated. My vote should be
  changed to 'YES' after the typos are fixed. 

  Bob Corbett's No vote on F08/0079:

    I agree with the point raised in question Q4 that it is unclear
    whether the requirement for confirmation is intended to apply to
    length type parameters.  I think the problem is greater than that
    The interpretation given here assumes that the namelist group object
    is implicitly typed if the NAMELIST statement precedes an explicit
    declaration of its type.  That assumption is contradicted by
    paragraph 4 of Clause 5.5 [109:17-19].

    The declared type of a namelist group object will be established
    either by implicit or explicit typing.  Therefore, the only portion
    of paragraph 5 of Clause 5.6 [111:19-23] that is required for types
    and type parameters is the second sentence.  The first sentence is
    needed only for the rank.

    A possible rewrite of paragraph 5 of Clause 5.6 that resolves the
    problems is:

      If the rank of a namelist group object is specified
      by a specification statement in the same scoping unit
      as the NAMELIST statement, that specification statement
      shall precede the NAMELIST statement.  If the type of
      a namelist group object is explicitly declared by a type
      declaration statement in the same scoping unit as the
      NAMELIST statement and the NAMELIST statement precedes
      the type declaration statement, the explicit type and its
      type parameters shall match the type and corresponding
      type parameters that the implicit mapping for the scoping
      unit would assign the name of the namelist group object.

  Bill Long's Yes with Comment vote on F08/0079:

    The test codes have numerous typos/syntax errors:

    in Q2:

      Class(t),Intent(In) :: dtv

    should be

      Class(t(6)),Intent(In) :: dtv

    - original was missing a required KIND type parameter value

      Allocate(x, Source=t(6)(1.5)      !  B

    is missing a ")" after the (1.5).

    in Q3:

       Allocate(x, Source=t(6)(1.5)      !  B

    is missing a ")" after the (1.5).

    in Q4:

      Class(t),Intent(In) :: dtv	

    should be

      Class(t(*)),Intent(In) :: dtv

    - original was missing a required type parameter value

       Allocate(x,Source=t(1,[15]))     ! B

    should be

      Allocate(x,Source=t(1)([15]))

    - original was missing the type parameter because of wrong
      syntax.

  Result: Accept Bill's typo fix-ups.  F08/0079 passes as amended.

F08/0080   Array constructors with polymorphic values

  Bill Long's Yes with Comment vote on F08/0080:

    The code example for Q2 declares and allocates the variable Z, but
    does nothing with it. Seems irrelevant to the Question asked.

  Van Snyder's Yes with Comment vote on F08/0080:

    Presumably, the penultimate line of Program m198_003a in Q2
    ought to be "Print *, [ x, y, z ]".  Otherwise, the question
    doesn't make sense.  Maybe the program name ought to be m198_003b.

  Result: Accept Van's changes.  F08/0080 passes as amended.

F08/0081   Deallocation error handling

  Bob Corbett's No vote on F08/0081:

    I continue to believe that the 4.5.6.3 means and should mean that
    finalizers are invoked only after successful deallocations.  The
    interpretation given is likely to lead to data structures left in
    indeterminate states.  I think that will severely restrict what a
    program can safely do after an error condition occurs during
    deallocation.

  John Reid's Yes with comment vote on F08/0081:

    After the changes of corrigendum 1, the edit for 4.5.6.3 is to the
    second paragraph.

  Van Snyder's Yes with Comment vote on F08/0081:

    In the edits for [76:10] and [131:12], I would prefer "during"
    to "in".

  Result: Accept John and Van's changes.  F08/0081 passes as amended.

************************************************************************

F08/0082   Generic identifier and dtv arguments

  Bob Corbett's No vote on F08/0082:

    There is a problem with the wording of the constraint.  The
    definition of the term "generic identifier" is:

      1.3.78
      generic identifier
      lexical token that identifies a generic set of procedures,
      intrinsic operations, and/or intrinsic assignments.

    None of the alternatives for a <defined-io-generic-spec> (R1208)
    is a lexical token.  Either the wording of the constraint needs
    to change or the definition of a generic identifier needs to be
    expanded.

  Bill Long's Yes with Comment on F08/0082:

    As Van pointed out, the discussion refers to READ(FORMATTED) whereas
    the example program has WRITE(FORMATTED).  Changing the discussion
    text to WRITE(FORMATTED) is the simpler fix.

  Van Snyder's Yes with Comment vote on F08/0082:

    "READ(FORMATTED)" in the penultimate paragraph of the question
    ought to be "WRITE(FORMATTED)", or the opposite change ought
    to be made in the program.

  Result: Accept Bill's change.  F08/0082 passes as amended.

NUMBER: F08/0040
TITLE:  MOVE_ALLOC for coarrays
KEYWORDS: intrinsic, allocation
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Was it intended that MOVE_ALLOC be applicable to coarrays?

ANSWER:

Yes.  A call to MOVE_ALLOC on coarrays might involve the deallocation
of a coarray, therefore MOVE_ALLOC needs to be an image control
statement.

Also, the coranks of FROM and TO need to be the same.

Edits are supplied to correct this.

DISCUSSION:

It might appear that C541 which says
  "An entity with the INTENT(OUT) attribute shall not be an
   allocatable coarray ..."
might prohibit MOVE_ALLOC from operating on coarrays; however, this
constraint applies to user-defined procedure not to intrinsic
procedures.

An edit is supplied to clarify C541.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[97:13] In 5.3.10 INTENT attribute, C541,
  Change "An entity"
  to "A dummy argument of a nonintrinsic procedure".
{Clarify the constraint.}

[188:23+] In 8.5.1 Image control statements, paragraph 2,
          insert new bullet point before the STOP statement one,
  "- a CALL statement that invokes the intrinsic subroutine MOVE_ALLOC
     with coarray arguments;"

[372;18] In 13.7.118p3 MOVE_ALLOC, FROM argument,
         "type and rank" -> "type, rank, and corank".
{Edit is not necessary, but makes it more readable.}

[372:19] In 13.7.118p3 MOVE_ALLOC, TO argument,
         After "same rank" insert "and corank".

[372:29+] 13.7.118, p6+
  Insert new paragraph immediately before "Example:"
    "When a reference to MOVE_ALLOC is executed for which the FROM
     argument is a coarray, there is an implicit synchronization of
     all images.  On each image, execution of the segment (8.5.2)
     following the CALL statement is delayed until all other images
     have executed the same statement the same number of times."

NUMBER: F08/0074
TITLE: Implicit type in BLOCK construct
KEYWORDS: IMPLICIT, BLOCK
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Consider

  Program m198_1
    Implicit Complex(a-z)
    Logical x
    x = .True.
    Block
      Dimension x(2)
      x = 3
      Print *,x
    End Block
  End Program

Is this standard-conforming, and if so, what is the type of the X
inside the BLOCK construct?

The Fortran 2008 standard specifies the implicit mapping in program
units, interface bodies, internal procedures, and module procedures,
at 5.5p3, but does not specify the implicit mapping in a BLOCK
construct.

ANSWER:

This was intended to be standard-conforming; the type of X is COMPLEX.
An edit is provided to remedy this omission.

EDIT:

[109:16] In 5.5p3, last sentence,
         After "and the default for"
         change "an internal or module procedure"
         to "a BLOCK construct, internal subprogram, or module
         subprogram".

This makes the whole sentence read
  "If a mapping is not specified for a letter, the default for a
   program unit or an interface body is default integer if the letter
   is I, J, ..., or N and default real otherwise, and the default for
   a BLOCK construct, internal subprogram, or module subprogram, is
   the mapping in the host scoping unit."

QUESTION:

(1) Consider the following

  module Funcs

    interface operator ( .op. )
      module procedure Unary, Binary
    end interface

  contains

    function Unary ( Arg )
      integer, intent(in) :: Arg
      integer, pointer :: Unary
    ...
    end function Unary

    function Binary ( Arg1, Arg2 )
      integer, intent(in) :: Arg1, Arg2
      integer, pointer :: Binary
    ...
    end function Binary

  end module Funcs

  program What

    use Funcs
    integer :: X, Y = 42

    10 .op. x = y

  end program What

Is the "10" in "10 .op. x = y" an operand, and therefore an argument of
a reference to Binary, or is .op. a reference to Unary and "10" a
statement label?

(2) Consider the following

  module Funcs

    interface operator ( .op. )
      module procedure Unary, Binary
    end interface

  contains

    function Unary ( Arg )
      integer, intent(in) :: Arg
      character(len=...), pointer :: Unary
    ...
    end function Unary

    function Binary ( Arg1, Arg2 )
      integer, intent(in) :: Arg1, Arg2
      character(len=...), pointer :: Binary
    ...
    end function Binary

  end module Funcs

  program What

    use Funcs
    integer :: X = 42, Y

    read (10) .op. x, y

  end program What

Is "10" an <io-control-spec-list>, or is "(10) .op. x" a <format>?

Note that this program is valid Fortran 90, and "(10) .op. x" is
a <format> according to the Fortran 90 standard.

ANSWER:

It was an oversight that the programs in (1) and (2) conform to the
syntax and constraints in two different ways.  Edits are supplied to
remove the ambiguities.

EDITS:

[45:7] 3.3.1p1 append new sentence
  "The first nonblank character of a statement that is not part of a
   statement shall not be a digit."

[212:2+] 9.6.1, After R910, insert constraint
  "C909a (R910) <input-item-list> shall not begin with an operator."

  Malcolm Cohen's No vote on F08/0075:
 
    (Note that the edit is wrong - missing 'label' after the second
     statement – but that is not the reason for voting NO.)
 
    Even though a '.ADDRESS.' operator might look 'cool', I have come
    to the conclusion that allowing operator syntax to denote variables
    is a mistake. The standard has various restrictions on operators to
    reduce the ability to obfuscate your code, e.g. arguments are
    required to be INTENT(IN).  The purpose of operator syntax was to
    allow user-defined algebra, not junk coding.
 
    There is no functionality provided by this feature that is not
    adequately served, with less obfuscation, by function reference
    syntax.
 
    The correct fix for this interp is to acknowledge our mistake in
    permitting this syntax to occur at all anywhere, and changing R602
    and C602 to
 
      R602 variable is designator or function-reference
 
      C602 (R602) function-reference shall have a data pointer result.
 
    Note that a less extreme viewpoint would be to allow the operator
    syntax except as the variable in an assignment statement (or READ
    statement). That would be a better solution than the nitpicky syntax
    tweaks that are the current proposed solutions to this interp and
    the next, but would not be as consistent as disallowing this
    problematic syntax entirely.

  Result: A new answer and edits need to be prepared => F08/0075 fails.

to remove the ambiguity in the current standard.

ANSWER:

This is another example of the same problem as F08/0075, viz syntactic
ambiguity caused by the F2008 feature "operator syntax for variable
denotation".  Therefore this interpretation request is subsumed by
F08/0075.

TITLE: Function references as variables in DATA statements
KEYWORDS: function, reference, DATA
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

The Fortran 2008 standard extended the syntax of variables to
allow references to functions to be variables (6.2, 117:13,15).
Because of that extension, a function reference may appear as a
<data-stmt-object> (5.4.7, 104:15).  For example, the program

      PROGRAM DATA
        REAL, TARGET :: X
        DATA PF()/1.0/
      CONTAINS
        FUNCTION PF()
          REAL, POINTER :: PF
          PF => X
        END FUNCTION
      END

satisfies the syntax rules and constraints of Fortran 2008.
Was this intended?

ANSWER:

References to function were not intended to be allowed as
<data-stmt-object>s.  An edit is supplied to correct this
oversight.

EDIT:

[5.4.7, 104:26-27]

Replace
    "In a <variable> that is a <data-stmt-object>, each
     subscript, section subscript, substring starting point
     and substring ending point shall"
with
    "A <data-stmt-object> that is a <variable> shall be a
     <designator>, not an <expr>.  Each subscript, section
     subscript, substring starting point, and substring
     ending point in the <variable> shall"

NUMBER: F08/0078
TITLE: Are the IEEE values +0 and -0 distinguished
KEYWORDS: IEEE, zero, IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Suppose the value of IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE is true for arguments of
some kind type parameter values for a processor.  Is the processor
required to distinguish between the real values +0 and -0 if the kind
type parameter value of those zeros is among the kind type parameter
values for which IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE is true?

ANSWER:

No, the processor is not required to distinguish between positive and
negative zero.


DISCUSSION:

If IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE is true, IEEE_COPY_SIGN is required to behave
differently with positive and negative zero representations; however
this is because the IEEE_COPY_SIGN function copies the "sign bit" of
the underlying representation, and in this it is acting in the same
manner as the TRANSFER intrinsic.

This means that even on a processor that does not distinguish between
positive and negative zero in the places where the Fortran standard
has different behaviour depending on that distinction (viz I/O and
the SIGN intrinsic), the processor can still provide the IEEE features
and the user can still access the IEEE copysign functionality using
the IEEE_COPY_SIGN function.

None.

The standard requires, at 5.6p5,
   "A namelist group object ... shall have its type ... specified
    by previous specification statements ...".

The declared type of X is specified by the type declaration marked
"! A", but the dynamic type of X is specified by one of the assignment
statements (either "! B" or "! C").

Is this program intended to be standard-conforming?

  Program test
    Use m198_002b
    Class(t(6)),Pointer :: x                  ! A

    Write (*,n)
    Allocate(x,Source=t2(6,int64)(1.5,2**60)) ! D
    Write (*,n)
  End Program

The standard required, at 5.6p5,
  "A namelist group object ... shall have its ... type parameters
   ... specified by previous specification statements ...".
This was modified by Corrigendum 1 to read
  "A namelist group object ... shall have its ... kind type
   parameters ... specified by previous specification statements ...".

The declared type of X has the kind type parameter P, and this is duly
specified at the statement marked "! A", but the dynamic type of X
after either of the assignment statements marked "! C" or "! D" has an
additional kind type parameter K, and this specification does not
precede the NAMELIST statement.

Is this program intended to be standard-conforming?

Q3.  Consider the program consisting of the same module as in Q2, but
     with the revised main program:

  Program test
    Use m198_002b
    Implicit Type(t(6)) (a-z)
    Namelist/n/x
    Class(t(6)),Pointer :: x                  ! A
    Allocate(x,Source=t(6)(1.5))              ! B
    Write (*,n)
    Allocate(x,Source=t2(6,int32)(1.5,2**30)) ! C
    Write (*,n)
    Allocate(x,Source=t2(6,int64)(1.5,2**60)) ! D
    Write (*,n)
  End Program

The standard says at 5.6p5
  "If a namelist group object is typed by the implicit typing rules,
   its appearance in any subsequent type declaration statement shall
   confirm the implied type and type parameters."

The declared type of X, and its declared kind type parameters, are
specified at "! A", and these are indeed the same type and type
parameters that appear in the IMPLICIT statement, but X is CLASS(T(6))
not TYPE(T(6)).

Is this program intended to be standard-conforming?

Q4.  Consider

  Module m198_002d
    Use Iso_Fortran_Env
    Type t(mp)
      Integer,Len :: mp
      Integer c(mp)
    Contains
      Procedure :: fwrite => fwrite_t

  Program test
    Use m198_002d

    Write (*,n)
    Allocate(x,Source=t2(2,5)([15,30],[4,3,2,1,0])) ! D
    Write (*,n)
  End Program

The declared type of X, and its declared kind type parameters (of
which there are none), are specified at "! A", and these are indeed
the same type and kind type parameters that appear in the IMPLICIT
statement, but the length type parameters are not the same.  However,
after Corrigendum 1 there is no requirement for prior specification of
the length type parameters, so it is unclear whether the requirement
for confirmation is intended to apply to length type parameters as
well as kind type parameters.

Is this program intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

A1.  This program was intended to be conforming.  The requirement for
     prior specification of the type was intended to mean the declared
     type only.  An edit is supplied to clarify the intent.

A2.  This program was intended to be conforming.  The requirement for
     prior specification of the kind type parameters was intended to
     apply only to type parameters of the declared type.  An edit is
     supplied to clarify the intent.

A3.  This program is conforming.

A4.  This program is not conforming.  If the IMPLICIT statement were
       Implicit Type(t(:)) (a-z)
     it would be conforming.  No edit is necessary.

EDITS:

[111:19-20] In 5.6 paragraph 5,
  Change what was originally
    "type, type parameters, and shape"
  but which was changed by Corrigendum 1 to
    "type, kind type parameters, and rank"
  to
    "declared type, kind type parameters of the declared type, and
     rank".
{It would be nice to be able to say "declared kind type parameters"
 but that phrase it not used in the standard at present.}

Q1.  Consider

  Program m198_003a

    Type,Extends(t) :: t2
      Real b
    End Type

    Allocate(x,Source=t2(1,2))
    Allocate(y,Source=t(3))
    Print *, [ t :: x, y ]
  End Program

Constraint C4105 of the standard, page 85, says
  "If <type-spec> specifies a derived type, all <ac-value> expressions
   in the array constructor shall be of that derived type ..."

However, although the declared type of X is type T, its dynamic type
is type T2.

Does this program conform to the standard?

Q2.  Consider

  Program m198_003b
    Type :: t
      Real a
    End Type
    Type,Extends(t) :: t2(n)
      Integer,Len :: n

    End Type
    Class(t),Allocatable :: x,y,z

  End Program

4.8 paragraph 2 of the standard says
  "If <type-spec> is omitted, each <ac-value> expression shall have
   the same length type parameters; in this case, the declared type
   and type parameters of the array constructor are those of the
   <ac-value> expressions."

However, although the length type parameters of the declared types of
X, Y and Z are the same (all being the empty set), the length type
parameters of the dynamic types are not: Y has no dynamic length type
parameters, and the value of the dynamic length type parameter N of X
and Z are different.

Does this program conform to the standard?

Q3.  Consider

    Allocate(x,Source=t2(1,2))
    Allocate(y,Source=t2(3,4))

  End Program

This appears to conform to the standard, but the dynamic type of the
array constructor is the same as its declared type, and is therefore
abstract.  Is this intended to conform to the standard?

      If (istat/=0) Print *,'Deallocation error',istat
    End Subroutine
  End Module
  Program testprog
    Use m198_005a
    Type(t),Target :: x
    Type(t),Pointer :: y
    Allocate(y)
    x%name = 'target_x'
    y%name = 'allocated_y'
    Call test(y)
    y => x
    Call test(y)
  End Program

Is this program standard-conforming, and if so, does it print
 Goodbye target_x
?

Note that 4.5.6.3 says
  "When a pointer is deallocated its target is finalized."
This could be interpreted as meaning "successfully deallocated" in
which case the finalizer would not be invoked, or it could be
interpreted as including any unsuccessful deallocation attempt, in
which case the finalizer would be invoked.

Q2. Consider
  Program m198_005b
    Implicit None
    Type t
      Character(:),Allocatable :: name
    End Type
    Type(t),Target :: x
    Type(t),Pointer :: y
    Integer :: istat
    Allocate(y)
    x%name = 'target_x'
    y%name = 'allocated_y'
    Deallocate(y)
    y => x
    Deallocate(y,Stat=istat)
    If (.Not.Allocated(x%name)) Print *,'x is now nameless'
  End Program

6.7.3.2 says
  "When a variable of derived type is deallocated, any allocated
   allocatable subobject is deallocated."

Again, this does not specify whether this applies only to successful
deallocation.

Is this program standard-conforming, and does it print
 x is now nameless
?

ANSWER:

Whether the final subroutine is invoked, and whether any allocated
allocatable subobject is deallocated, is processor dependent.

EDITS:

[76:10] Append new sentence to 4.5.6.3p2 {after F08 corrigendum 1}
  "If an error condition occurs during deallocation, it is processor
   dependent whether finalization occurs."
[131:12] Append new sentence to 6.7.3.2p8
  "If an error condition occurs in deallocation, it is processor
   dependent whether an allocated allocatable subobject is
   deallocated."
[459:33+] In A.2,
  After "whether and when an object is finalized ... (4.5.6.3);"
  Insert new bullet point
    "whether an object is finalized by a deallocation in which an
     error condition occurs (4.5.6.3);"
[460:5+] In A.2,
  After "the order ... event described in 6.7.3.2;"
  Insert new bullet point
    "whether an allocated allocatable subobject is deallocated when
     an error condition occurs in the deallocation of an object
     (6.7.3.2);"

QUESTION:

Consider
  Module m198_010
    Interface g
      Module Procedure mp1, mp2
    End Interface
    Type t
      Real c
    End Type
    Interface Write(Formatted)
      Module Procedure fwrite

  Contains
    Subroutine mp1(a,dtv)
      Integer,Intent(Out) :: a

      a = dtv
    End Subroutine
    Subroutine mp2(b,dtv)
      Real,Intent(Out) :: b
      Integer,Intent(In) :: dtv
    End Subroutine
    Subroutine fwrite(dtv,unit,iotype,v_list,iostat,iomsg)
      Class(t),Intent(In) :: dtv
      Integer,Intent(In) :: unit,v_list(:)
      Character(*),Intent(In) :: iotype
      Integer,Intent(Out) :: iostat

After corrigendum 1, constraint C1214 reads

  C1214 Within the scope of a <defined-io-generic-spec>, if two
        procedures have the same generic identifier, their \cf{dtv}
        arguments (9.6.4.8.3) shall be distinguishable.

The scope of the WRITE(FORMATTED) generic-spec is the entire module
M198_010, and within that module, the two procedures MP1 and MP2 have
the same identifier (G), but their DTV arguments are not
distinguishable.  This clearly violates the new C1214, but the module
conforms to the Fortran 2003 standard.

Is this module intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

Yes, this was intended to be standard-conforming.  An edit is supplied
to correct the typographical error in Corrigendum 1.

EDITS:

[286:12-13] In the new version of C1214 from Corrigendum 1,
  change "the same" to "that".
