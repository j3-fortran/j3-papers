Subgroup recommends no action on this for the following reasons.

1. We are not considering new items for a future revision at this time.
   We have a full set of features for inclusion in Fortran 2028 and cannot
   afford to distract ourselves.

2. The paper itself admits the new feature would be of small benefit.

3. It appears that the language already provides support for this style of
   programming, by using a "stub" procedure with an ERROR STOP statement
   instead of a DEFERRED procedure.

4. After publication of Fortran 2028 we anticipate opening up to new
   feature requests. We recommend that the submitter review and revise his
   proposal if it is still needed at that time.
