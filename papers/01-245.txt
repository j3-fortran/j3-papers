Overview
========

While working on issue 323, /data discovered a number of errors
and infelicities on the draft related to the word "keyword".
This document attempts to repair some of them:
o  Simplify 2.5.2 by grouping three of the meanings together.
o  Fix BNF error related to <keyword>.
o  Fix font typo in BNF.
o  Fix a small number of inconsistent uses of the word keyword.
o  Change "component name keyword" to simply "component keyword"
   to be more consistent in terminology.
o  Delete unhelpful glossary entries.

Edits
=====

[19:2-25] Replace the text of 2.5.2:
{Note to Richard: some of this text comes from the existing
2.5.2; it is re-entered here to better allow J3 to see the effects
of some fairly extensive edits.}
"The term <<keyword>> is used in two ways in this standard.

  (1) It is used to described a word that is part of the syntax
      of a statement.  These keywords are not reserved words; that
      is, names with the same spellings are allowed.  In the
      syntax rules, such keywords appear literally.  In descriptive
      text, this meaning is denoted by the term <<statement
      keyword>> and by the use of the term keyword without any
      preceding modifier.  Examples of statement keywords are:
      IF, READ, UNIT, KIND, and INTEGER.

  (2) It is used to denote names that identify the constituents
      of a list.  In contexts such as the OPEN statement, the
      allowed names are part of the syntax, and these are keywords
      in the first sense, as well.  In contexts where the allowed
      names are not specified, the syntactic class <keyword> is
      used.

R2XX <keyword> <<is>> <name>

      In descriptive text, a modifier indicative of the source
      of the valid names precedes the word keyword; an <<argument
      keyword>> is the name of a dummy argument in the interface
      for the procedure being referenced, a <<type parameter
      keyword>> is the name of a type parameter in the type being
      specified, and a <<component keyword>> is the name of a
      component in the type of the value being assembled by a
      structure constructor.

NOTE 2.6

Use of keywords rather than position to identify constituents
of a list can make such lists more readable and allows the
constituents to be reordered.  This facilitates specification of
a list in cases where optional constituents are omitted."

[55:26/56:44/56:45/57:11] Change "component name keyword" to
"component keyword".

[399:12-13] Delete glossary entry for component name keyword.

[403:27-28] Replace glossary entry for keyword with the following:

statement or a name that is used to identify a consituent of a
list."

[406:36-37] Delete glossary entry for statement keyword.
