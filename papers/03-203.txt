                       Fixing NEW_LINE

                          Dan Nagle


In our zeal to make a NEW_LINE intrinsic, we omitted a few aspects
which, I believe, are needed to make NEW_LINE actually work as
intended.  No doubt, this was due to the combination of the last-minute
adding of the feature and the (perhaps unexpected) size of the
feature.

The motivation for adding NEW_LINE is that we want an abstraction to
make formatted streams work for any character type, not only those we
know ACHAR(10) supports; to wit, ASCII, ISO_10646 and EBCDIC.  At the
very least, NEW_LINE ought to be required to work for any possible
default character type.  For nondefault character types, it appears the
design is to return the newline character, or to return a blank to
signal failure.

The current difficulties are several, basically, we don't treat
possible future character sets very generally:

First, we don't acknowledge the possibility that the default character
type may not have control characters, let alone one which may be used
as newline, and

Second, we say where control characters are prohibited, but we don't
say how a program may obtain one (even in a note, even though we say
you need one to use all the features of formatted streams), and

Third, in fact, we don't say anything about control characters at all
(other than parenthetically remarking that newline is one), even how
they might affect the collating sequence (which might change an
existing program in an unexpected way), and

Fourth, we allow processor to prohibit (some) control characters from
appearing in formatted streams!  Evidently, we want to specificly allow
newline, and

Fifth, we want to require that the C_NEW_LINE character be the same as
the character returned by NEW_LINE for the C_CHAR character type
(rather than noting that we anticipate a coincidence), and

Sixth, we ignore the effects of newline in formatted records (whether a
character expression written to a formatted stream can be written to a
formatted record), and

Seventh, while not required but since NEW_LINE is modeled after the
inquiry intrinsics, it would be nice to allow NEW_LINE to return its
value even when its argument is a nonpresent optional dummy argument of
the procedure in which it appears (this allows a print procedure to
print an empty line or a default line when passed no string), and

Eighth, again, while not required but since NEW_LINE is modeled after
the inquiry intrinsics, it would be nice to allow NEW_LINE in
initialization expressions (where many programmers will want to put
it), and

Lastly, we don't say how we want NEW_LINE to work with any default,
non-ASCII, non-ISO_10646 character types ('processor-dependent' isn't
much of a hint).

We also neglected to add NEW_LINE to the list of new stuff in the
Introduction.  But then, we forgot to add lots of other new features to
the Introduction on the first pass, too.

In analysing these issues, I found a couple of other character issues
which may as well be addressed.  See the new text at 42:12-14: ASCII
and ISO_10646 are defined, other character sets are not.  Specifically,
we say that for nondefault character types, the blank character is
processor dependent.  In fact, for nondefault ASCII and ISO_10646
characters types, the blank character is specified.  For the default
character type, if not ASCII nor ISO_10646, blank is, in fact,
processor dependent.  Furthermore, for non-ASCII, non-ISO_10646
character types, newline is processor dependent.  For default character
types, the definition of NEW_LINE punts to the definition of ACHAR,
which punts (again, 'processor-dependent' isn't much of a hint).

In short, NEW_LINE as specified is broken and should be either removed
or fixed.  I propose to fix it.  New language added at 164 regarding
characters breaks several other claims regards blanks in Notes in the
standard, I propose to fix those as well.

There are several questions which should be answered before proceeding
to fix NEW_LINE.  These are:

0. Do we want newline to be required to be a control character?  Or is
a vendor permitted to choose a graphic character if a character set
lacks control characters?  (I suggest NO, the programmer is better
situated to choose the graphic character to be so used, if needed.)

1. Do we intend that the default character type will always support a
newline character? (I suggest YES.)

2. Do we intend that any character type will always support a newline
character? (I suggest MAYBE.)

3. If it's possible for NEW_LINE to fail to provide a newline
character, do we want the failure to be signaled by the same character
for any character kind?  Or may the failure be signaled by a processor
dependent value? (I suggest YES.)

4. Since the standard is now for the first time describing uses for
control characters, and we limit where control characters may be
specified and where control characters may be used, do we want to
provide notes giving some guidance or rationale regarding the
limitations on control characters?  (I suggest YES, we certainly give
hints for lesser issues.)

To fix NEW_LINE:

We can either declare that newline is a part of the Fortran character
set (which default characters must support) or add newline to the
requirements for the default character set as a separate requirement.
I propose further edits to require that NEW_LINE either return a
newline character or a blank to allow a program to detect failure of
NEW_LINE to supply the necessary character, and I propose Notes to
explain why control characters work as they do.  I also propose to fix
the erroneous Notes regarding which characters are specified and which
are processor dependent.

I provide edits for several approaches.  Where there are alternative
edits, I indicate the choices.

EDITS

       "NOTE 3.1+ Within the ASCII and ISO 10646 character
	standards, the Fortran character blank is called space (or sp,
	code 32) and the Fortran character newline is called newline

--end choose none or either but not both--

--note whence control characters--

41:1- add a new paragraph to NOTE 4.12
      "Note that control characters may not portably appear
       in character literals, nor portably appear in
       formatted input/output.  The portable means of
       obtaining control characters is via unformatted
       input/output, or via the ACHAR (13.7.2), CHAR (13.7.19)
       or NEW_LINE (13.7.85) intrinsic procedures."

--control characters don't interfere with collating sequences--

42:11 after "letters." add "The newline character shall
      not appear within any of the collating sequences
      specified in items (1), (2) or (4) above."

--fix untruths about blank--

At 137: NOTE 7.29, 143: NOTE 7.39, 185: NOTE 9.19, 235: NOTE 10.16
Change "nondefault" to "non-ASCII, non-ISO_10646" in each
of the above notes.

--allow newlines of nonpresent optional dummys--

127:41+ Add to the list (and renumber the rest)

        "(4+) The other inquiry function NEW_LINE,"

--say why no newlines allowed in formatted records--

173:35+ add "NOTE 9.1+ This standard does not specify
        the mechanism of file storage.  Therefore,
        processors are allowed to prohibit newline characters from
        formatted records because newline characters may
        interact with the processor's record separation
        mechanism."

--allow newline in formatted stream--

177:10 after "file." add "However, the processor shall not
       prohibit a newline control character from appearing
       in the characters sent to a formatted stream."

177:10+ add the note
        "NOTE 9.9+  The effect of the newline control character
         is to end the current record.  Its representation
         in the file, including the number of file storage units
         required, is unspecified."

--note that newline is only specified for ascii, iso-10646--

235: Note 10-17 add at the end "For non-ASCII, non-ISO_10646
     character types, the newline character is processor dependent."

--unneeded if 23:13 or 24:15 is done--
--choose one--

       character type supports one.  Otherwise, the result is
       the blank character."

--OUT-OF-ORDER !--

302:2 change "processor dependent" to "the blank character"

3:25- add "(5) Earlier Fortran standards left unspecified
      the default character returned by ACHAR when the default
      character type did not support the ASCII character
      specified.  This standard specifies that a default blank
      character is returned."

--end choose one--

--require NEW_LINE( C_CHAR_'') == C_NEW_LINE--
--and require that NEW_LINE either work or return a blank--

341:21-26 reorder the cases of the results (i) --> (iii),
          (ii) --> (ii), (iv) --> (iv)

341:21+ insert "<case(i)> If the kind value of A is equal to the
        named constant C_CHAR from the ISO_C_BINDING intrinsic module,
        the result is the named constant C_NEW_LINE
        from the ISO_C_BINDING intrinsic module."

--note why NEW_LINE( C_CHAR_'') == \n--

341:26+ add "Note 13.16+  The requirement
        that C_NEW_LINE = NEW_LINE( C_NEW_LINE) means that
        the Fortran processor and the C coprocessor must agree
        on the newline character.  This is necessary for character
        entities to be processed in either Fortran procedures or C
        procedures, and allow the input/output of those character
        entities to occur via either Fortran input/output or C
        input/output."

394 Note 15.3 change "." to " in order for character
        entities to be processed in either Fortran procedures or
        C procedures, and allow the input/output of those character
        entities to occur via either Fortran input/output or C
        input/output."
