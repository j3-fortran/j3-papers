Subject: C12 - UTI 52 : bits pointer and argument association
Date:    28-jul-2006

---------------------

Unresolved Technical Issue 52 (page 314) notes that allowing the
unrestricted association of entities of different type through the use
of bits pointers is a fundamental change that has undesirable
consequences.

Unresolved Technical Issue 53 (page 314) notes that allowing argument
association of allocatable entities of different types causes problems
for certain implementations (for example, if type information is
encoded in the dope vector). Also noted was the possibility that,
indirectly, objects of types real and integer might be argument
associated, resulting in curdled blood.


Reply: The inclusion of the new pointer association capability as part
of the bits proposal was mainly for completeness, though there are
some convenient uses, like being able to use a bits pool of memory as
having different types at different times in the program (as an
alternative to space-saving equivalence). However, the associated
optimization issues and other consequences appear to outweigh the
benefits.  Edits are provided to remove this capability for argument
association and pointer assignment.

In the case of allocatable entities having type-mismatched
associations, the dope vector issue is manageable since we require an
interface in this case. However, the main interest in mis-matched
argument association does not depend on allocatable dummy arguments,
so this feature could be removed without significant loss of
functionality. Edits are provided to remove this capability.

The indirect association of integer and real variables is independent
of the pointer or allocatable issues. Instead, it arises from allowing
both bits_actual/non-bits_dummy and non-bits_actual/bits_dummy
association.  If only one was allowed, then the undesirable
associations would not occur.  The mode of primary interest is the
bits dummy, so edits are provided to remove the oppposite case for
nonpointer nonallocatable dummy arguments.


Edits:
------

In subclause 7.4.2 Pointer assignment:

[163:3] Remove "either".

[163:4-5] Remove ", or <data-target> and <data-pointer-object> shall
be bits compatible".

[164:21-22] Reomve ", or <data-pointer-object> and <data-target> shall
be bits compatible (4.3.1.3)".


In subclause 12.5.1.4 Actual arguments associated with dummy data objects:

[312:5-6] Replace "type compatible or bits compatible (4.3.1.3) with
the associated actual argument" with "type compatible with the
associated actual argument or it shall be of type bits and bits
compatible with the associated actual argument."

[313:5] Remove "either".

[313:6-7] Remove "or the actual argument and the dummy argument shall
be bits compatible".

[314:2] Remove "either".

[314:2-3] Remove "or the actual argument and the dummy argument shall
be bits compatible".
