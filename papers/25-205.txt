Subject: Recommendation on adding MASK argument to NORM2
Date: 2025-November-04
Reference: 25-170, 25-171

Paper 25-170 presents the /JoR subgroup with a recommendation that a
MASK argument be added to NORM2.
Paper 25-171 presents the proposed edits for inclusion.

While the proposal looks simple enough, this was not part of the WG5
work plan. Also, the current standard workload is already of a size that
it will be a challenge to integrate all features.

Subgroup recommends not including this feature at this time, and the
submitter is encouraged to resubmit for a future standard revision.
