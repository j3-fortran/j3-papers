Subject: Another mistake about inquiry functions in Clause 17
Date: 2018-June-12

1. Introduction
---------------

Subclause 17.1 paragraph 5 claims that inquiry functions can be used to
determine the extent of support of some IEEE features.

Many of the functions to determine support are not inquiry functions.
This is a mistake that needs to be corrected.  Furthermore the sentence
is mere advertising and as such is not useful.

It was not mentioned in any comment.

2. Edits
--------

Delete the last sentence of subclause 17.1 paragraph 5, viz. "In all
cases, ... inquiry functions."
