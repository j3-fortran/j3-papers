From: Kurt W. Hirchert                  (Meeting 164) 15 Mar 2003

A recent discussion in comp.lang.fortran convinced my that we have
a problem in the F2K draft that was not addressed by any of the
ballots.  I have prepared a brief description of what I perceive
the problem to be and what I hope is a simple solution.  Because
it did not appear in the ballots, it is quite possible that it will
be ruled out of order, but because the problem appears to me to be
a serious one, I hope it will receive at least some consideration.
(I can "live with" the committee (or reviewing subgroup) deciding
that the problem is not as serious I believe or that my proposed
change is not a suitable solution, but I would hate to see us fail
to even look at a problem purely on procedural grounds.)

===========
The Problem
===========

The problem area is functions with side effects, especially
functions whose purpose is to deliver side effects.  Fortran has
always allowed its functions to perform operations that would be
considered side effects, but it also has given processors the
license to not execute those functions and thus not deliver
those side effects.  There is great controversy about how far
this license extends, but some things appear to be true no
matter what position one takes on the extent of the license:

*  There is nothing the writer of a function with significant
   side effects can do to ensure that those side effects are
   actually produced.

*  There are actions that can be taken by the writer of code
   that calls such functions, but the available control is one-
   sided.  One can clearly write function references in contexts
   that will raise the possibility that its side effects will
   not be delivered, but there is no _agreed_upon_ way to avoid
   all such actions.

*  Ultimately, it the processor that controls whether a function
   is executed or not, but portability is achieved only if all
   existing (and future) processors can be counted on to
   execute a given function reference.

None of this is new.  The cautious Fortran programmer avoids the
uncertainty by never coding functions with significant side effects,
using subroutines instead.  The programmer who wants to write in
a style using functions with side effects gets no assurances from
the standard and must depend instead on rules of thumb about what
processors optimize away; if those rules of thumb prove incorrect,
a lower level of optimization may have to be selected to avoid the
problem.

What is new is the introduction of C interoperability.  The rules
for optimization in C are quite different, so side effects can be
ensured.  As a result, functions with significant side effects
are the norm in C.  Our interoperability facility maps these to
functions in Fortran, with the same license to not execute them
and thus not deliver the side effects.  In order to ensure those
side effects, the cautious programmer must write a C wrapper that
converts the interface from a function interface to a "subroutine"
with an additional INTENT(OUT) argument, so C optimization rules
ensure the function is invoked and Fortran optimization rules
ensure that the subroutine is invoked.  It seems to me that if one
still needs to routinely write wrappers to safely use our C
interoperability facility, there is something missing in that
facility.

===================
A Possible Solution
===================

Part of the reason we have had difficulty clarifying the rules for
function side effects is that there are two competing interests
with differing needs.  It is in the interests of those who use
Fortran functions solely to compute mathematical functions for the
processor to have as much license as possible to optimize away
unnecessary execution of those functions.  On the other hand,
those who want to use a programming style involving function with
significant side effects would prefer a more C-like set of rules,
so they could depend on function references being executed.  An
obvious solution is to provide a syntactic distinction between
functions that can be optimized away and those that can't, so the
appropriate rules can apply to the appropriate forms.

One possibility would be to distinguish on the basis of the PURE
attribute.  A processor certainly can optimize pure function
references more agressively. but not all function without
significant side effects can be made pure, so that would be a less
than satisfactory solution.

The alternative then is to create a new function attribute.  That
leaves the question of whether the new attribute should indicate
that a function can be optimized away or that it cannot be.  Since
existing source code has functions that do not have this attribute
but can be optimized away, the obvious choice is that the new
attribute will identify functions that cannot be optimized away
and whose side effects are thus reliable.

In the edits I have chosen the keyword VOLATILE because I see a
similarity between functions that must be executed and variables
that must loaded from memory.  Indeed, a function that depends
on a volatile variable will indeed be a volatile function.
However, the edits are so constructed that another keyword can
easily be substituted.  The edits provide only for the
declaration of volatile functions and the elimination of the
license to optimize away the execution of such functions; no
change is made in the rules for optimizing functions without
the attribute.  Such a change might be appropriate at some time
in the future, but the object here was to minimize the changes
so there would be no unintended consequences.

=====
Edits
=====

1.  129:11  Change "It" to "Except for the requirement that
    volatile functions be evaluated in each expression in which
    they are referenced, it".

2.  114:17  After "is not pure", insert ", <proc-target> may be
    not volatile even if <proc-pointer-object> is volatile,".

3.  252:19  After "elemental," insert "whether it is volatile,".

4.  254:7+  Insert "(3+1) The procedure is volatile,".

5.  256:4  After "be pure", insert ", and that the interface may
    specify a procedure that is volatile if the procedure is not
    defined to be volatile".

6.  267:24  After "pure", insert ", an actual argument that is not
    volatile may be associated with a volatile dummy argument,".

7.  275:34+  Insert "<<or>> VOLATILE".

8.  275:36+  Insert "C1243+1(R1227)  A <prefix> shall not specify
    PURE or ELEMENTAL if it specifies VOLATILE."

9.  276:33+  Insert "If the <prefix-spec> VOLATILE appears, the
    function is volatile, and the function shall be executed as
    part of the evaluation of any expression in which it is
    referenced."

10. 280:13+  Insert "The keyword VOLATILE is not used in an ENTRY
    statement.  Instead, the function defined by an ENTRY
    statement is volatile if and only if VOLATILE is specified in
    the FUNCTION statement."

11. I expected to need to add VOLATILE to at least one of the
    BIND(C) examples, but I found no examples of BIND(C)
    interfaces to C functions with side effects.  Perhaps there
    should be one, but if so, I will leave it to the C experts
    to construct an appropriate one.
