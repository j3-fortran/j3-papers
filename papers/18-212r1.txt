1. Discussion

Paragraph 1 of Subclause 7.3.1 states

      A declaration specifies the type of a named object.

Some declarations, DIMENSION statements for example, do not
specify the type of a named object.

An edit is provided.


2. Edit to 18-007

[7.3.1 "Relationship of types and values to objects" p1, 58:37-38]

Replace

      "A declaration specifies the type of a named object."

with

      "A declaration can specify the type of a named object."
