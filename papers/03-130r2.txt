Subject: Edits for UK comment MTC7 (Output of IEEE exceptional values)
Date: 3 April 2003

1. Introduction

This version has been modified to reflect the results of straw votes.
Some of the options offered in the original edits have been deleted.


Comment MTC7 was
   "Allow input/output of IEEE exceptional values.

    Input/output of IEEE "exceptional" values should be specified.  
    Currently, if the user has an IEEE infinity (or NaN), i/o is completely 
    non-standard.  Now that the standard supports IEEE arithmetic, it should 
    specify the i/o results, and at least for the infinities should specify 
    what they are (for NaNs it would be acceptable to make it "processor-
    dependent".  Similarly, the results of various intrinsic functions (e.g. 
    EXPONENT and FRACTION) should be specified for these values."

2. Discussion - i/o formatting

There are existing implementations which produce interesting strings for
output of IEEE exceptional values.  There are fewer implementations which
permit reading such values back in.  The output produced by each 
implementation generally differs from the others in detail.

There are two obvious paths:
(1) minimally standardise the output, to reduce the impact on existing
    implementations.
(2) specify the output in essentially the same level of detail as is currently
    done for unexceptional values.

The proposal in this paper follows the second path.  It attempts to be
maximally conformant with existing implementations, but there is so little
consensus between them that there is not much one can do.

A survey of 12 existing implementations produced the following results

Compiler   String for Positive Infinity   String for NaN    Justification
1:            " Infinity"                 " NaN"             left
2:            "INF"                       "NaNQ"             right
3:            "Inf"                       "-NaN"             left
4:            "Inf"                       "NaN"              right
5:            "inf"(F),"INF"(E)           "nan"(F),"NAN"(E)  right
6:            "+INF"                      "NaN"              left
7:            "+Infinity"                 unknown            left
8:            "+" repeated                "?" repeated       filled
9:            "INF"                       "NaN"              dec. pt. aligned
10:           "inf"                       "-nan"             right
11:           "?" repeated                "?" repeated       filled
12:           "Infinity"                  "NaN"              right
13:           "Infinity"                  "NaN"              right

The most common name for infinity is "Infinity".
The most common name for NaN is "NaN".
The most common justification is right.

There is some justification for allowing processors to produce additional text
following the basic "NaN" output, e.g. to convey additional information as to
how that NaN has arisen.

3. Discussion - intrinsic functions

There are a number of intrinsic functions where the result is defined in
terms of the numeric model in 13.4.  This does not work for infinities and
NaNs, since they do not fit that model.  The functions affected are EXPONENT,
FRACTION, RRSPACING and SPACING.

4. The proposal in brief

F edit descriptor:
  IEEE Infinity: optionally signed "Inf" or "Infinity", right-justified.
  IEEE NaN: unsigned "NaN", optionally followed by processor-dependent text,
            right-justified.

(If there is not enough room, the whole field should be filled with asterisks
as per usual when things don't fit.)

E edit descriptor:
  IEEE Infinity: optionally signed "Inf" or "Infinity", right-justified
  IEEE NaN: unsigned string "NaN", followed by zero or more processor-dependent
            characters, right-justified.
            Even with SP, do not produce a sign (NaNs do not have a sign).
            All positions after the "NaN" to be processor-dependent.

G edit descriptor:
  Use E format.
ES and EN edit descriptors:
  Same as E format.
List-directed:
  Pick any format which avoids asterisks.

On input:
  "Inf[inity]" and "+Inf[inity]" (not case sensitive) shall produce IEEE_POS_INF.
  "-Inf[inity]" shall produce IEEE_NEG_INF.
  "NaN" shall produce IEEE_QUIET_NAN.
  "NaN" followed by non-blanks shall produce IEEE_QUIET_NAN or
        IEEE_SIGNALING_NAN (processor-dependent).  The intent here is that
        those processors which write NaN information after the NaN can use
        this to make writing + reading the identity function.

EXPONENT intrinsic:
  return HUGE(0) for infinities.
    (that's the biggest number we can return!)
  return HUGE(0) for NaNs.
    (NaNs are pretty significant.
     We cannot return a NaN because the result is of type integer.)
FRACTION intrinsic:
  return the argument.
    (This preserves the X=SCALE(FRACTION(X),EXPONENT(X)) identity.
     A possible alternative would be to return NaN for both INF and NaN.)
RRSPACING intrinsic:
  return zero for infinities.
  return NaN for NaNs.
SPACING intrinsic:
  return +infinity for infinities.
    (That's what the spacing is.)
  return NaN for NaNs.

5. Basic design decisions

These potential straw votes are the main design points for the proposal.
In each case the first option is the one recommended by this paper.

Q1. Level of detail of specification in the standard should be:
>>> a. Similar to ordinary numbers, i.e. detailed
    b. Minimal, basically all INF/NaN i/o would be processor-dependent
    u. Undecided.


Straw vote  16-1-0


Q2. The string for IEEE_POS_INF, excluding the sign, should be
    a. "Infinity"?
    b. "INF"?
    c. "Inf"?
    d. "inf"?
>>> e. "INF" with processor-dependent case, optionally followed by "inity"?
    u. Undecided.

Straw vote  2-0-3-0-13-0


Note: If option (e) is chosen, we ought to require all processors to accept
      all the variant forms.

Not Q3:
  The base string for a NaN shall be "NaN".

Q4:
>>>  The base string for a NaN may be followed by processor-dependent text
     conveying some processor-dependent information.

Straw vote  13-2-3


Q5. The form of the processor-dependent text shall be
    a. "..." where "..." is any number of non-blank chars?
>>> b. "(...)" where "..." is any number of non-blank non-parentheses chars?
    c. completely processor-dependent?
    u. undecided.
Straw vote    4-11-0-2


Comment: option (b) is what has been suggested to the IEEE 754R committee,
though they've not discussed it yet.

Q6. The base string (NaN/INF) should be aligned:
>>> a. right-justified
    b. left-justified
    c. decimal-point-aligned
    u. undecided
Straw vote    11-0-6-1


6. Minor (uncontroversial!) design details

M1. No sign shall be output for a NaN.
{NaN's do not have signs.}

M2. No sign shall be accepted on input for a NaN.
{Ditto.}

M3. The base string for signalling and quiet NaNs shall be the same.
{Signalling NaNs tend to turn into quiet NaNs when you look at them anyway,
and this sort of information can be in the processor-dependent suffix.}

M4. Obviously, in list-directed output, the processor should use an appropriate
    format that results in at least "Inf[inity]" and "NaN" being produced.  This
    can be left as a QoI issue.

7. Edits to 02-007r3

[225:25] After "in" insert "an IEEE exceptional specification or".
{Map lower-case to upper-case for inf/nan.}

[225:30] Between "field" and "consists", insert
  "is either an IEEE exceptional specification or"
{This whole paragraph only describes ordinary values.}

[226:3-] Insert new paragraphs
  "The input field for an IEEE exceptional specification consists either of
   (a) an optional sign, followed by the string 'INF' or the string 'INFINITY'
   or
   (b) the string 'NAN', optionally followed by a processor-dependent number
       of nonblank characters enclosed in parentheses.
   The value specified by form (a) is an IEEE infinity; this form shall not
   be used if the processor does not support IEEE infinities for the input
   variable.  The value specified by form (b) is an IEEE NaN; this form shall
   not be used if the processor does not support IEEE NaNs for the input
   variable.  The particular NaN value is processor-dependent, except that
   if there are no nonblank characters following the 'NAN' string, it is a
   quiet NaN."
{Input of exceptional values.
 Note: 'INFINITY' and 'NAN' specified instead of 'Infinity' and 'NaN' because
 we want the input not to be case sensitive - see edit at [225:25].}

[226:3-] Insert description of Infinity/NaN output before paragraph.
  "For an internal value that is an IEEE infinity, the output field consists of
   blanks, if necessary, followed by a minus sign for negative infinity or
   an optional plus sign otherwise, followed by the letters "Inf" or "Infinity",
   right justified within the field.  If <w> is less than 3, the field is filled 
   with asterisks, otherwise, if <w> is less than 8, "Inf" is produced.

   For an internal value that is an IEEE NaN, the output field consists of
   blanks, if necessary, followed by the letters "NaN" and optionally followed
   by up to <w>-5 nonblank processor-dependent characters enclosed in 
   parentheses, right justified within the field.  If <w> is less than 3, the 
   field is filled with asterisks.

   Note 10.10a
   The processor-dependent characters following "NaN" may convey additional
   information about that particular NaN.

[226:3] Change "The" to "Otherwise, the".

[226:14-] Insert description of Infinity/NaN E-format output before paragraph.
  "For an internal value that is an IEEE infinity or NaN, the form of the
   output field is the same as for F<w>.<d>."

[226:14] Change "The" to "Otherwise, the".

[227:9-] Insert description of Infinity/NaN EN-format output before paragraph:
  "For an internal value that is an IEEE infinity or NaN, the form of the
   output field is the same as for F<w>.<d>."

[227:9] Change "The" to "Otherwise, the".

[228:1-] Insert description of INF/NaN ES-format output before paragraph:
  "For an internal value that is an IEEE infinity or NaN, the form of the
   output field is the same as for F<w>.<d>."

[228:1] Change "The" to "Otherwise, the".

  [230:25-] Insert descr. of Infinity/NaN G-format output before paragraph:
    "For an internal value that is an IEEE infinity or NaN, the form of the
     output field is the same as for F<w>.<d>."
  [230:25] Change "The" to "Otherwise, the".

{Note to J3, no edits are needed for list directed or namelist I/O because
238:15, 243:18 require the processor to use reasonable output formats!}


[311:26] Replace with
  "If X has the value zero, the result has the value zero.  If X is an IEEE 
   infinity or NaN, the result has the value HUGE(0)."
{Specify EXPONENT of exceptional values.}

[312:25] Append
  "If X is an IEEE infinity, the result is that infinity.
   If X is an IEEE NaN, the result is that NaN."
{Specify FRACTION of exceptional values.}

[341:17] Append
  "If X is an IEEE infinity, the result is zero.
   If X is an IEEE NaN, the result is that NaN."
{Specify RRSPACING.}

[346:20] Change
"is not zero" to "does not have the value zero"
[346:21] Change
"Otherwise" to "If X has the value zero"

[346:22] Append
  "If X is an IEEE infinity, the result is positive infinity.
   If X is an IEEE NaN, the result is that NaN."
{Specify SPACING.}

8. Other Notes

There is an inconsistent use of terminology for the value in output
formatting.

In 10.6.1.1, it is called the "value of the internal datum" at [225:10,18,20],
and the "internal value" at ([225:11,13]).

In 10.6.1.2.1, it is called the "internal value" ([226:3,5]).

In 10.6.1.2.2, it is called the "datum value" ([226:19]).

In 10.6.1.2.3, it is called the "value of the datum" ([227:13-14,17]).

In 10.6.1.2.4, it is called the "value of the datum" ([228:5,8]).

In 10.6.1.2.6, it is called the "internal value" ([228:23,26,27] - the
first of these is a description of what is meant by "internal value").

In 10.6.2, it is called the "value of the internal datum" ([229:19-20]).

In 10.6.3, it is called the "internal representation" ([229:32,230:2-3,4]).

In 10.6.4.1.2, it is called the "datum" ([230:25,31+1,231:0+1,2+8]) or
"internal datum" ([230:26]).

These all appear (to me at least) to be talking about the same thing.
I've used "internal value" in the edits above.

We recommend that these all be changed to the same wording to avoid confusion.
Below are the edits for changing them all to "internal value".

[225:10,18,20] Change "value of the internal datum" to "internal value", thrice.
[226:19] Change "datum value" to "internal value".
[227:13-14,17] Change "value of the datum" to "internal value", twice.
[228:5,8] Change "value of the datum" to "internal value", twice.
[229:19-20] Change "value of the internal datum" to "internal value".
[229:32,230:3,4] Change "representation" to "value", thrice.
[230:25] Change "datum" to "internal value".
[230:26] Change "internal datum" to "internal value".
[230:31+1,231:0+1,2+8] Change "datum" to "internal value", four times.
