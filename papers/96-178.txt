Date:     16-Nov-1996
To:       X3J3
From:     /JOR {Stan Whitlock}
Subject:  X3J3 votes on WG5/misc Fortran 2000 Requirements

At meeting #139 X3J3 voted on a collection of possible "miscellaneous"
requirements for Fortran 2000 gathered by Christian Weber as head of the
WG5/misc subgroup, listed in paper 96-168 {"Miscellaneous Requirements for
Fortran2000 - Christian Weber, 16th Oct. 1996, Version 1}.

The voting process was as follows:

    o	the /JOR subgroup made an initial list of items from 96-168 as
	possible "miscellaneous" requirements for Fortran 2000

	several of the requirements in 96-168 are already on X3J3's list
	of "minor technical enhancements":  they were not voted upon and
	are marked below as "J3/M#" where "#" is the item number from the
	"X3J3 Work Plan", paper 96-115r7

    o	members of X3J3 added items from 96-168 to this list without
	discussion

    o	items from 96-168 not added to this list were considered "unanimous
	No" votes

    o	straw votes (Yes, No, "undecided"s not allowed) were taken on the
	items on the list with no discussion {voting was based on technical
	merit, not necessarily on schedule or resource considerations}

    o	the results of the voting as described in this papar will be sent
	to Christian Weber {CHRISTIAN.WEBER@S31.MCH1.x400.sni.de} and the
	WG5/misc subgroup reflector {sc22wg5-misc@ncsa.uiuc.edu}
