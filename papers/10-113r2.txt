Subject: Comments GB-14 and CA-02/3/4: Clarify execution of certain
         intrinsic procedures
Date: 2010 February 16
References: WG5/N1802, WG5/N1803, J3/09-007r3


DISCUSSION

1. GB-14

The document does not specify how certain intrinsic procedures,
principally in class S, may be used as far as their use in unordered
images is concerned. The proposal is already implied for those of
classes E, ES and PS by other wording. Those of class A are already
covered.

For implementations where images are separate processes run under a
batch scheduler, it is common for the command and its environment to
be different for image 1 and the other images; this restriction is
already in the standard for "READ (*,...)". It would also be reasonable
to implement secondary images by calls to 'network CPU servers', where
they might not be associated with a command at all.

2. CA-02

There is a discussion on random number generator (RANDOM_NUMBER) on
multiple images, but is left unstated what the relationship is between
cores. We prefer that each image be able to generate random numbers
independently, but if this is not possible, there should be a statement
that this is processor dependent.

3. CA-03

It is not stated what the behaviour is between 2 images that execute
EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE concurrently. 	We recommend that this be stated
to be processor dependent.

4. CA-04

The behaviour between two images that execute the following intrinsics
cannot be guaranteed. COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT, GET_COMMAND,
GET_COMMAND_VARIABLE, CPU_TIME, DATE_AND_TIME, SYSTEM_CLOCK.	
We'd like to specify that it is processor dependent to the values
returned on multiple images using the listed intrinsics.

PROPOSAL

The edit proposed here comes from GB-14. It appears to cover
CA-02/3/4, too, but additional edits are provided to allow images
to share a common generator. Additional edits are supplied for Annex A.

EDITS

[325:1-]In 13.5 "Standard generic intrinsic procedures" after Table 13.1,
 add the new paragraphs:

     The effects of calling COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT, EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE,
     GET_COMMAND, GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT, GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE on any
     image other than image 1 are processor dependent.

     If RANDOM_SEED is called in a segment A, and either RANDOM_SEED or
     RANDOM_NUMBER is called in segment B, then segments A and B shall
     be ordered. It is processor dependent whether each image uses a
     separate generator, or if some or all images use common generators.     
     It is processor dependent how sequences of calls to RANDOM_NUMBER
     in unordered segments on images that use a common generator
     interleave with each other.

     It is processor dependent whether the results returned from
     CPU_TIME, DATE_AND_TIME and SYSTEM_CLOCK are dependent on which
     image calls them.

     NOTE 13.x

     For example, it is unspecified whether CPU_TIME returns a
     per-image or per-program value, whether all images run in the
     same time zone, and whether the initial count, count rate, and 
     maximum in SYSTEM_CLOCK are the same for all images.
     [END NOTE]
     
     The use of all other standard intrinsic procedures in unordered
     segments is subject only to their argument use following the rules
     in 8.5.2.


[464:3+] In Annex A, A.2 Processor Dependencies, add new entries:

     "the effects of calling COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT,
     EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE, GET_COMMAND, GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT,
     GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE on any image other than image 1 (13.5);"

     "whether each image uses a separate generator,
     or if some or all images use common generators (13.5);"
     
     "how sequences of calls to RANDOM_NUMBER
     in unordered segments on images that use a common generator
     interleave with each other (13.5);"

     "whether the results returned from CPU_TIME, DATE_AND_TIME and
     SYSTEM_CLOCK are dependent on which image calls them (13.5);"
