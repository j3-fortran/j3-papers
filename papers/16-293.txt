1.1 Opening business

1.1.1 Remarks from the chair - Dan Nagle

   Dan Nagle welcomed everyone to meeting 211.  Our major work is
   completing integration of topics in the current draft F2015.

1.1.2 Adoption of the agenda - Dan Nagle

** motion: Adopt the agenda - there will be no USTAG meeting - as
           amended (moved by Whitlock/seconded by Snyder): passed
           with unanimous consent {uc}

1.1.3 Approval of Meeting 210 minutes - Dan Nagle

** motion: move paper 16-239 as minutes of meeting 210
          (Snyder/Long): uc

1.1.4 INCITS report - Dan Nagle

   Dan is scheduled for officer training.

   As always, Dan drew everyone's attention to:

     the INCITS Anti-Trust Guidelines and INCITS Patent Policy is
     intended as a reminder and available on the INCITS website at

      http://www.incits.org/standards-information/legal-info.

document_id=48108&wg_abbrev=eb

1.1.5 WG23 (Vulnerabilities) report - Dan Nagle

   The draft Fortran Annex needed to be updated to accommodate
   newly defined vulnerabilities.  This work was proceeding but
   with low priority.

1.1.6 ISO/WG5 report - Steve Lionel

   There will be no US TAG meeting on Thursday.

1.1.7 J11 (PL22.11 C/C++) Liaison report - Dan Nagle

   A draft of Cplex == "Programming language C - Extensions for
   parallel programming" is available.

1.1.8 MPI Liaison report - Bill Long

   MPI resilience feature == "User Level Failure Management" ==
   ULFM is on track - basically the same as Fortran:  detect if
   a rank failed, and identify which ranks failed. May vote at
   the next MPI meeting.

   Allesandro working with ULFM of MPI to interface with
   OpenCoarrays. MPI will support what Fortran does.


1.1.9 OpenMP Liaison report - Bill Long

   The OpenMP committee has continued its preparation for the
   upcoming technical report release due this November. The report
   will be a working draft snapshot of the OpenMP 5.0 spec for wider
   user/community feedback. The current plan is for OpenMP 5.0 to be
   released in November of next year.

   Some major things in the works:

   * OMPT (tool interface) to be integrated into OpenMP spec
   * new memory and allocator traits for allocating in specialized memory
     (both APIs and directives)
   * clarify mapping semantics to target devices, including for Fortran
     pointers/allocatables
   * task/data affinity support

   There is a F2F meeting next week (in Japan) where the language
   committee will be going over various issues in preparation for the
   TR release.

1.1.10 UPC Liaison report - Damian Rouson

   None

1.1.11 OpenACC Liaison report - Bob Scollard for Mark LeAir

   Discussions for a minor update to the current OpenACC 2.5 standard are
   underway by the OpenACC Committee.  Some of the possible updates
   include:

   *  Better support for C structs, C++ classes, and Fortran derived types
      with allocatable/pointer components. 
   *  Query routines that allow the application to detect available
      devices and properties of the devices.
   *  A method for error handling so an application can gracefully exit
      if there is a fatal error in device code.
   *  Better Fortran bindings on all of the runtime API routines.
   *  A serial offload construct (a sequential version of the parallel
      offload construct).
   *  Support for systems where some memory is shared and some is not.

   One feature that will not make it into the minor update is deep copy.
   Deep copy continues to be a complex issue, so there is no planned
   support for it in the next revision.  On some devices, deep copy
   requires moving whole data structures or portions of data structures
   to device memory and then moving the modified data back.  Some future
   devices will have better hardware and OS support for automatically
   migrating data between memories, so deep copy may be less important
   in the coming years.  In the near term, the Committee hopes to have
   some prototype implementations for experimentation and for driving
   future work.

   More information is available at http://www.openacc-standard.org/

1.1.115 WG9 Ada Report - Van Snyder

   Van sent a few corrections to WG9 for their "Fortran Interoperability
   Clause", eg, don't use INTEGER*4.

1.1.12 Treasurer's report - Van Snyder

   Opening bank balance at meeting 211:  $1816.87

   This is the same as the closing balance from meeting 109 - there
   were no expenses between meetings.

   There is a $50 meeting fee at meeting 211.  The  regular $50 meeting
   fee will continue at meeting 212.
