[Introduction]

For the Data declaration bullet, insert:

The default mapping for implicit typing is now considered to be
obsolescent.

[136:32+] 8.7p3 IMPLICIT statement

Append to p3:

It is obsolescent for an entity to be implicitly typed using
the default mapping.

[601:3+]

Insert new subclause:

B.3.yy Default implicit typing

Default implicit typing is a significant source of programming
errors and has been superseded by explicit typing. The IMPLICIT
statement can still be used to specify mapping for initial letters
of identifiers.

--END--
