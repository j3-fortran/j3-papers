NUMBER: 000068
TITLE: Asterisks as I/O units
KEYWORDS: Asterisk, I/O, unit
DEFECT TYPE:   Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

Question:

1.   Does the Fortran 95 standard require the external unit
     corresponding to the I/O unit identified by an asterisk for
     input or output to be the same as the external unit identified
     by some fixed nonnegative integer value?

2.   Can the I/O unit identified by an asterisk for input or output
     correspond to more than one external unit?

3.   If the external unit identified by an integer value that
     corresponds to the I/O unit identified by an asterisk for input
     or output is closed, does that cause the I/O unit identified by
     an asterisk to become disconnected?

ANSWER:

     1.   No.

     2.   No.

     3.   Yes.

DISCUSSION:

The submitter states:  At least one Fortran 95 implementation uses -1
as the value of the I/O unit identified by an asterisk.  A carefully
constructed INQUIRE statement can expose this value to the user.  Many
users expect I/O to the units identified by asterisks to continue to
work even after the corresponding units identified by integer values
have been closed.

     1.   There is no requirement in the standard that the asterisk
correspond to an external-file-unit; it is, however, permissible.  An
edit is provided to clarify this.

     2.   For the units identified by the asterisk, the text of
section 9.3.2 does not allow two or more units to be connected
simultaneously to the same external device or file [139:8-9].

     3.   There might not be an external-file-unit that corresponds
to the io-unit specified by an asterisk, as clarified by the edit
below.  If there is, it is permissible to execute a CLOSE statement
on them as on any other unit.

Note however that a processor extension may have two units connected to the
same file - e.g. unit 6 and the * output unit might both identify the user's
display.  This is not detectable by a standard-conforming program, but in
this
case closing unit 6 would not necessarily affect output to the display via
*.

EDITS:
  Add the following text to the end of the last paragraph before
section 9.3.1 [138:34+]:
     "An asterisk used in an input statement may identify the same
      <io-unit> as a particular <external-file-unit>.  An asterisk
      used in an output statement may identify the same <io-unit> as
      another particular <external-file-unit>."
