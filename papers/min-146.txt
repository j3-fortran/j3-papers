Minutes of Meeting 146
J3 ANSI Fortran Standards Committee
August 10-14, 1998
San Diego, California


1.  Monday, 10 Aug. 1998

1.1  Opening Business

Meeting 146 of the J3 Fortran Standards Committee was called to order at 8:30 AM by the chair, Tony Warnock

1.1.1  Remarks from the chair

Four large codes will be started at LANL using Fortran.  They would like to be able to use templates.  Calling C libraries is their major interoperability concern.

1.1.2  Adoption of Agenda

There will be no US TAG meeting this week.
Motion:  (Whitlock/Maine):  
"Approve the agenda as amended"  
Passed by Unanimous Consent.  See Appendix A for the final meeting agenda.

1.1.3  Approval of meeting 145 minutes

Amend to note that Henry Zongaro is the head of the Interoperability subgroup in Appendix D.
Motion:  (Whitlock/Hendrickson):  
"Approve the meeting 145 minutes as amended"  
Passed by Unanimous Consent.

1.1.4  NCITS/OMC report

Tony Warnock will go to an  NCITS officer training session in September.  He will also give a summary of his WG5 report to NCITS in September.

1.1.5  ISO/WG5 report

The meeting was useful and productive.  The two issues that will affect this meeting are Internationalization (resolution T6) and Derived Type I/O (resolution T8).

Paper N1320 presents the requirements for Internationalization which WG5 believes will meet the SC22 guidelines.  Most Internationalization guidelines affect application programs, not programming languages, and C Interoperability allows access to a large collection of standard interfaces.  

Paper N1322 is the only WG5 paper we have received on Derived Type I/O resolution T8.

For resolution T4 (Varying Length Strings) the development body is investigating elemental versus pure for TRIM, etc.  The code is being removed from the Part 2 documents and there is no formal test suite for Varying Length Strings.

For Resolution T9, Interval Arithmetic will be split up among the other J3 subgroups.

1.1.6  Treasurer's report

We currently have $1380.63 in the bank, we expect about $700 in additional expenses at this meeting, we have paid $1200 so far for this meeting, and expect about $600 in meeting fees.

Motion:  (North/Whitlock):  
"Exempt Ted Terpstra from the meeting fee."  
Passed by Unanimous Consent.

1.1.7  Beginning membership report

Baker Kearfott has resigned.  We now have 14 members.  The quorum is 5 and the majority is 8.
No one is in danger of losing membership due to non-attendance at this meeting.

Jeanne Martin is representing Brian Smith.  Richard Maine is representing Malcolm Cohen.  Ted Terpstra and Matthijs van Waveren are visiting.

1.1.8  Local arrangements

1.1.9  Comments from members

Kurt Hirchert reported that NCSA might continue support for the e-mail reflectors and data bases.

Richard Maine reported that the NASA mirror site is now operational.  He has indirect access to the mirror through NASA Dryden operational support.

There are 14 members.  Nine were present at the meeting and 2 were represented by alternates.

Matthijs van Waveren intends to become a member at the next meeting.

Loren Meissner's membership is in jeopardy.

5.4.5  Comments from members

van Waveren:  A Japanese group is working on extensions to HPF.  He will post a web reference.

Dedo:  It would be nice if we had a list of standards and web references that might interact with Fortran.
Bierman:  Not all groups have web sites
Whitlock:  If anyone finds an interesting reference to standards that affect us, send the reference to Jerry Wagener for inclusion on the J3 web page.

Maine:  Given the potential difficulties at NCSA and NASA, would it be possible for Walt Brainerd to host the J3 web site on his FORTRAN.COM site.  This appears to be possible in a few months.  The details will need to be worked out later.

Motion:  (Whitlock/Maine):  
"That the meeting be adjourned."
  Passed by Unanimous Consent.
