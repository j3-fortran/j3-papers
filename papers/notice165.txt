Hotel Telephone Usage: The hotel charges $0.50 for local telephone

     ance and international calls being placed from your hotel room
     be made using a prepaid calling card.  Such prepaid calling
     cards can be purchased very inexpensively from many department
     stores, convenience stores, and discount buying clubs.  The
     hotel will still charge $0.50 for each call made with a prepaid
     calling card, but there are no additional hotel surcharges on
     long distance or international calls made with prepaid calling
     cards.
