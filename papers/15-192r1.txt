Introduction
------------
Work item UK-23 relaxed restrictions on the stop code in STOP and
ERROR STOP. The following text is copied from there:

Basic Functionality: Add ability to execute STOP and ERROR STOP
statements with a non-constant stop-code.

Rationale:

(a) There is no significant reason to require the stop-code in a STOP or
    ERROR STOP statement to be constant.
(b) It is tedious when writing error checks to have to expand what would
    be a simple one-line logical IF into a 4-line IF construct that first
    prints a string that is variable (e.g. a dummy argument) and then
    executes a STOP or ERROR STOP statement.
(c) It is not possible to return a variable process exit status from a
    Fortran program via STOP or ERROR STOP.  This may be desirable, for
    example, when a program executed via EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE fails, in
    which case one might wish to exit with the same exit status as the
    failed program.  This functionality is frequently accessible by
    using the C "exit" function, but that is not guaranteed to be
    available.
(d) In the case of error termination with ERROR STOP in a pure procedure,
    it is not possible to provide more information that might indicate
    what the problem is or whence it was called, as external file output
    is not allowed there.

During discussion of UK-23 a further enhancement was proposed:

The standard currently says that for the STOP and ERROR STOP statements
that the stop code "is made available in a processor-dependent manner."
A common implementation of this is to display a message on the standard
error output unit such as "FORTRAN STOP 1234". Many users have requested
the ability to suppress display of this message, especially as the
standard also encourages implementations to return integer stop codes as
the program's exit status.

Users have also requested the ability to suppress the standard's required
"warning" indicating which exceptions are currently signaling. Some
implementations provide a mechanism, such as environment variables, to
suppress display of these messages; standard syntax for this option is
desireable.

The sense of the committee was a preference for "all or nothing"
control rather than a more fine-grained control, as long as the syntax
could be extended in a future standard should further control be desired.

Specification
-------------

Permit non-constant stop codes in both STOP and ERROR STOP.

Add syntax to the STOP and ERROR STOP statements to allow programmer
execution-time control of the display of the stop code message and the
exception warning.

The constraint that the stop-code is to be of default kind remains.

Syntax
------

Change the <stop-stmt> and <error-stop-stmt> productions to be:

STOP [stop-code] [, QUIET = scalar-logical-expression]
ERROR STOP [stop-code] [, QUIET = scalar-logical-expression]

Change the <stop-code> productions <scalar-default-char-constant-expr>
to <scalar-default-char-expr>, and <scalar-int-constant-expr> to
<scalar-int-expr>.

Edits

[xviii] Introduction

Add to "Data usage and computation":

The stop code in a STOP or ERROR STOP statement is no longer required to
be a constant. Output of the stop code and exception summary from STOP
and ERROR STOP may now be suppressed.

[189:15-19] 8.4 STOP and ERROR STOP statements

Replace the three syntax rules and the constraint with the following:

R849 stop-stmt is STOP [ stop-code ] [, QUIET = scalar-logical-expression ]

R850 error-stop-stmt is ERROR STOP [ stop-code ]
                                   [, QUIET = scalar-logical-expression ]

R851 stop-code is scalar-default-char-expr
               or scalar-int-expr

C848 (R851) The scalar-int-expr shall be of default kind.

[189:23p2] 8.4 STOP and ERROR STOP statements

Remove "also"

[189:29-31p2] 8.4 STOP and ERROR STOP statements

End the paragraph at line 28, deleting lines 29-31. Insert two new
paragraphs, incorporating the text from lines 29-31, as follows:

If QUIET is omitted or is specified as .FALSE.:
   - if any exception (14) is signaling on that image, the processor
     shall issue a warning indicating which exceptions are signaling;
     this warning shall be on the unit identified by the named constant
     ERROR_UNIT (13.9.2.8).
   - if a stop code is specified, it is recommended that the code be made
     available by formatted output to the same unit.

If QUIET is specified as .TRUE., no output of signaling exceptions or
stop code is to be produced.

(The editor is encouraged to reformat the above text should he find it
stylistically appropriate.)
