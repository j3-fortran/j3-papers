Subject: Add reductions to DO CONCURRENT (US20)
Date: 2019-October-16

Reference: 18-007r1, 19-198r2

Introduction
============

Performing a reduction on the array elements computed
in DO CONCURRENT can be inefficient for large arrays.
Naive expressions of a reduction are non-conforming or
inefficient, requiring synchronization or explicit use
of temporaries.

At meeting 219, J3 approved continued work on this item,
passing paper 19-198r2.


Requirements
============

Provide Fortran support for some of the features of the OpenMP
reduction clause on numeric and logical intrinsic types.

The proposal should support:
    1. Extend DO CONCURRENT to include the addition of scalar
       and array "reduction variables".

    2. Allow multiple reduction variables to be defined for a
       single DO CONCURRENT.

    3. Support a limited set of intrinsic binary and n-ary operators
       as reduction operators.

    4. Provide the implicit initialization of the reduction variables
       consistent with the reduction operators.

    5. Have reduction variable semantics aligned with existing
       locality specifications for DO CONCURRENT.

    6. Have behavior analogous to a limited version of the OpenMP
       reduction clause.


Specification
=============
1. Add a new locality-spec to describe reduction variables.
   Reduction variables are local to each iteration of the loop,
   initialized with a suitable value upon entry to the loop, but are
   related to a defined instance of the reduction variable in the
   scope outside the loop.

2. Provide a limited set of operators and functions that can be
   applied to reduction variables. This list is currently
           + * .AND. .OR. .EQV. .NEQV. MIN MAX IAND IOR IEOR

3. Provide for default initialization of reduction variables.
   A suitable initial value of an induction variable can be determined
   by its reduction operator.

4. Provide a limited number of ways that reduction variables can
   be defined in an iteration.
   We will limit the use of reduction variables to simplify implementation:
       var = var op expression
       var = expression op var
       var = function (var, expression)
       var = function (expression, var)
   for suitable values of op and function.

5. Upon normal completion of the DO CONCURRENT the value
   of each reduction variable will be as if the value of the reduction
   variable prior to the execution of the DO CONCURRENT was combined
   with each value of the reduction variable from each iteration of
   the loop via the reduce operator. This combination could be
   performed in any order.

6. The processor may make assumptions about how to parallelize the
   DO CONCURRENT iterations to optimize or eliminate synchronized
   access to the reduction variables.


Discussion and Straw Votes
==========================

These will affect the edits:

1. Does it make sense for a reduction variable in an iteration
   to have the POINTER, VOLATILE, ASYNCHRONOUS attributes?
   I don't think so, but these were included in LOCAL and
   LOCAL_INIT for a reason.
   Straw vote: 1a: Remove POINTER? yes; no; undecided
               1b: Remove VOLATILE? yes; no; undecided
               1c: Remove ASYNCHRONOUS? yes; no; undecided

2. OpenMP specifies that a POINTER reduction value gets
   a local copy of the pointed-to value in each iteration.
   Is that how this should be handled?
   Straw vote: If the result of 1a is not "remove", should
               we define that the pointer target is made
               local to the iteration? Yes; no; undecided

3. The OpenMP spec 5.0 for reductions (beginning p.293)
   uses terminology of implicitly defined variables
   omp_in, omp_out and omp_priv to describe the behavior.
   Is that appropriate for the Fortran standard, or should
   we use terminology more based on how we describe the
   shadowing definitions of LOCAL and LOCAL_INIT locality-specs?
   It seems like it would simplify the wording needed,
   but feels un-Fortran-like.
   Straw vote: Describe REDUCE in terms of private, in, out
               instances of variables
               "it behaves as if ..." for the reduction variables.

4. This version includes array reduction variables. DO CONCURRENT
   (and OpenMP) only specifies the use of variable names for reduction
   variables, not array sections or such.
   Straw vote: Is that sufficient for REDUCE? Yes; undecided" (no "no")



Edits to 18-007r1
=================

{ edits in page order }

{ add remark to Introduction in the bullet for Execution control: }

[xiii] add:
"The REDUCE locality specifier for DO CONCURRENT provides the
ability to define reduction variables to be calculated on
the loop."

{ Introduction briefly describes new features }



{ 11.1.7.2 Form of the DO construct }
{ Extend the definition of locality-spec to include reduction variables}

[181:9] now reads:

"R1130 locality-spec is LOCAL ( variable-name-list )
                    or LOCAL_INIT ( variable-name-list )
                    or SHARED ( variable-name-list )
                    or DEFAULT ( NONE )"

after "DEFAULT ( NONE )" add "or REDUCE (reduce-op : variable-name-list)"

so the resulting rule reads
"R1130 locality-spec is LOCAL ( variable-name-list )
                    or LOCAL_INIT ( variable-name-list )
                    or SHARED ( variable-name-list )
                    or DEFAULT ( NONE )
                    or REDUCE (reduce-op : variable-name-list)"

{ Add to rule 1130 the new locality-spec }



{ Define a limited set of binary operators and procedures that can
   be used to combine values of the reduction variables}

[181:9+] After rule 1130, add new rules:

"R1130a  reduce-op is binary-reduce-op
                        or function-reduce-op

R1130b  binary-reduce-op is +
                        or *
                        or .AND.
                        or .OR.
                        or .EQV.
                        or .NEQV.

R1130c  function-reduce-op is MIN
                        or MAX
                        or IAND
                        or IOR
                        or IEOR"

{ The list of permissible reduction operations is defined }



{ Add REDUCE to list of restricted locality-specs in C1128 }

[181:22-26] Constraint C1128 now reads:
"C1128 A variable-name that appears in a LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT
locality-spec shall not have the ALLOCATABLE, INTENT (IN), or OPTIONAL
attribute, shall not be of finalizable type, shall not be a nonpointer
polymorphic dummy argument, and shall not be a coarray or an
assumed-size array. A variable-name that is not permitted to appear in
a variable definition context shall not appear in a LOCAL or
LOCAL_INIT locality-spec."

On line 22, replace "LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT locality-spec"
with "LOCAL, LOCAL_INIT or REDUCE locality-spec"

On line 25, replace "LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT locality-spec"
with "LOCAL, LOCAL_INIT or REDUCE locality-spec"

so that constraint C1128 now reads:
"C1128    A variable-name that appears in a LOCAL, LOCAL_INIT or REDUCE
locality-spec shall not have the ALLOCATABLE, INTENT (IN), or OPTIONAL
attribute, shall not be of finalizable type, shall not be a nonpointer
polymorphic dummy argument, and shall not be a coarray or an assumed-size
array. A variable-name that is not permitted to appear in a variable
definition context shall not appear in a LOCAL, LOCAL_INIT or REDUCE
locality-spec."

{ REDUCE variables are not allowed to be ALLOCATABLE, INTENT(IN)
  or OPTIONAL }


{ REDUCE variables are of limited type }
[181:26+] After constraint C1128, add a new constraint:
"C1128+    A variable that appears in a REDUCE locality-spec
shall be a scalar or array of type corresponding to its reduce-op
as defined in Table 11.1."

[181:26+] Somewhere near the new constraint, add this table:
"
            Table 11.1. The types of the allowed operands
                      for each reduction operator.

      OPERATOR            ALLOWED TYPES
      --------            -------------
        +                 integer, real, complex
        *                 integer, real, complex
      .AND.               logical
      .OR.                logical
      .EQV.               logical
      .NEQV.              logical
       MIN                integer, real
       MAX                integer, real
       IAND               integer
       IOR                integer
       IEOR               integer"

{ REDUCE variables are limited to scalars or arrays of numeric
  or logical types }



{ 11.1.7.5 Additional semantics for DO CONCURRENT constructs }

{ Add REDUCE as a new kind of locality }

[184:28-31 p1] Now reads:
"The locality of a variable that appears in a DO CONCURRENT construct
is LOCAL, LOCAL_INIT, SHARED, or unspecified. A construct or statement
entity of a construct or statement within the DO CONCURRENT construct
has SHARED locality if it has the SAVE attribute. If it does not have
the SAVE attribute, it is a different entity in each iteration,
similar to LOCAL locality."

In line 28, replace "LOCAL, LOCAL_INIT, SHARED, or unspecified"
with "LOCAL, LOCAL_INIT, REDUCE, SHARED, or unspecified"
so that the first sentence of paragraph 1 reads:

"The locality of a variable that appears in a DO CONCURRENT construct
is LOCAL, LOCAL_INIT, REDUCE, SHARED, or unspecified. A construct or
statement entity of a construct or statement within the DO CONCURRENT
construct has SHARED locality if it has the SAVE attribute. If it does
not have the SAVE attribute, it is a different entity in each
iteration, similar to LOCAL locality."


{ REDUCE is added to the types of locality }


{ Describe REDUCE locality as a kind of LOCAL locality }

[184:32-38 p2] now reads:
"A variable that has LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT locality is a construct
entity with the same type, type parameters, and rank as the variable
with the same name in the innermost executable construct or scoping
unit that includes the DO CONCURRENT construct, and the outside
variable is inaccessible by that name within the construct. The
construct entity has the ASYNCHRONOUS, CONTIGUOUS, POINTER, TARGET, or
VOLATILE attribute if and only if the outside variable has that
attribute; it does not have the BIND, INTENT, PROTECTED, SAVE, or
VALUE attribute, even if the outside variable has that attribute. If
it is not a pointer, it has the same bounds as the outside
variable. At the beginning of execution of each iteration,"

In line 32, replace "A variable that has LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT locality"
with "A variable that has LOCAL, LOCAL_INIT, or REDUCE locality"

so that the first sentence of paragraph 2 now reads
"A variable that has LOCAL, LOCAL_INIT, or REDUCE locality is a
construct entity with the same type, type parameters, and rank
as the variable with the same name in the innermost executable
construct or scoping unit that includes the DO CONCURRENT construct,
and the outside variable is inaccessible by that name within
the construct."

{ REDUCE is like a kind of local locality-spec }



{ Add description of how REDUCE locality is initialized }

[184:43+] Add a third bullet entry to paragraph 2
"- a variable with REDUCE locality has the pointer association status
of the outside variable. It is defined with the value corresponding
to its reduce-op as specified in Table 11.2; the outside variable
shall not be an undefined pointer."


[184:43+] Add Table 11.2 near the above edit
"Table 11.2. The default initial values for
            each reduction operator.

  OPERATOR          INITIAL VALUE
  --------          -------------
    +                     0
    *                     1
  .AND.                .TRUE.
  .OR.                 .FALSE.
  .EQV.                .TRUE.
  .NEQV.               .FALSE.
   MIN                 nnlmsbtp *
   MAX                 pnlmsbtp **
   IAND                 NOT(0)
   IOR                    0
   IEOR                   0

  * nnlmsbtp = the value of the negative number of the largest
    magnitude supported by the processor for numbers of the type
    and kind of the reduction variable.

 ** pnlmsbtp = the value of the positive number of the largest
    magnitude supported by the processor for numbers of the type
    and kind of the reduction variable."

{ initial values are defined for variables based on
  the reduce-op in the reduce locality-spec }



{ Add REDUCE to the LOCAL and LOCAL_INIT I/O, TARGET descriptions }

[185:1-4] Lines 1-4 after the bullet list currently reads:
"If a variable with LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT locality becomes an affector
of a pending input/output operation, the operation shall have
completed before the end of the iteration. If a variable with LOCAL or
LOCAL_INIT locality has the TARGET attribute, a pointer associated
with it during an iteration becomes undefined when execution of that
iteration completes.

In line 1, replace "LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT locality" with
"LOCAL, LOCAL_INIT, or REDUCE locality"

In line 2, replace "LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT locality" with
"LOCAL, LOCAL_INIT, or REDUCE locality"

so the paragraph now reads:
"If a variable with LOCAL, LOCAL_INIT, or REDUCE locality becomes an
affector of a pending input/output operation, the operation shall have
completed before the end of the iteration. If a variable with LOCAL,
LOCAL_INIT, or REDUCE locality has the TARGET attribute, a pointer
associated with it during an iteration becomes undefined when
execution of that iteration completes."



{ Add semantics for loop termination and REDUCE variables.
  I'm struggling with the wording here. }
[185:29+] After paragraph 5, which reads:
"A DO CONCURRENT construct shall not contain an input/output statement
that has an ADVANCE= specifier."

Add two new paragraphs:

"Variables listed in a REDUCE locality-spec can only appear
in the following forms within the body of the DO CONCURRENT:
   var = var binary-reduce-op expression
   var = expression binary-reduce-op var
   var = function-reduce-op( [expression-list ,] var [, expression-list] )

For DO CONCURRENT statements with a REDUCE locality-spec, the value of
each reduction variable is its value before the DO CONCURRENT combined
via the reduce-op with the values of each iteration's reduction
variable at the termination of the iteration. For array reduction
variables, this application is done elementwise. The application of
the reduction operators to the results of each iteration can be done
in any order."


{ Reduction variables actually reduce }

{ end }
