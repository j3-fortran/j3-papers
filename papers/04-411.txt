QUESTION:
Consider the following program:

      PROGRAM foo

        TYPE, ABSTRACT :: base
          INTEGER i
        END TYPE
        TYPE, EXTENDS(base) :: child
          INTEGER j
        END TYPE
        CLASS(*), POINTER :: x
        TYPE(child), TARGET :: c1

        x => c1
        SELECT TYPE (x)
          CLASS IS (base)
            PRINT *, 'Class is base'
          CLASS DEFAULT
            PRINT *, 'Class is not base'
        END SELECT

      END

Constraint C401 seems to prohibit the abstract type "base" from
appearing in a CLASS IS type guard statement, thus prohibiting this
program.  There seems to be no reason to prohibit this, and allowing it
seems to be useful in some situations.

Was this program intended to be standard-conforming?


ANSWER:
Yes, this program was intended to be standard-conforming.  An edit is
provided to correct this oversight.

All edits refer to 04-007.
[33:12]  After "(4.5.6)", insert "unless it appears in a CLASS IS type
         guard statement (8.1.5.1)".
