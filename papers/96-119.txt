  Subject:     Discussion of MAP_TO and BIND interoperability
  References:  ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG5 N1184 (X3J3/96-118), 
               ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG5 N1178 (X3J3/96-069), X3J3/96-106R1,
               X3J3/95-295 (HPF Calling C Interoperability Proposal v1.3)


  Document X3J3/96-106R1 is the X3J3 Liaison Report on Interoperability of 
  Fortran and C, based on the draft Technical Report WG5/N1178. This report
  favours a MAP_TO approach to interoperability, as outlined in the HPFF
  proposal X3J3/95-295. This is the most important conflict between the
  current opinion of X3J3 and the current WG5 draft TR, N1178.

  Being the project editor of this TR, I will, of course, try to produce a
  document following whatever direction WG5 specifies to be followed to
  address interoperability with ISO C. 
  But personally, I would strongly recommend to stay with the lines of N1178
  and _not_ to implement a MAP_TO mechanism. This document is an attempt to 
  explain my arguments for this position. It is _not_ a statement of the 
  development body for this TR.

  In the discussion I tracked, there were mainly two arguments in favour
  of the MAP_TO approach:

  (i) A vendor does not need to support intrinsic KINDs for all C types.
      For example, a vendor does not support an INTEGER kind for 8-bit 
      integers, but a C signed char must be mapped to a Fortran INTEGER.
      With MAP_TO, this can be done by converting to default integer, e.g.
      by writing "INTEGER, MAP_TO(signed_char) :: VARIABLE". 
      With the BIND approach, the vendor would be required to provide an 
      INTEGER(C_SCHAR_KI) type, and possibly also the whole set of intrinsic
      procedures and operations for this type. (Returning C_SCHAR_KI==-1
      is also possible, but clearly not desirable :-)

  (ii) The MAP_TO approach does not require the user to deal with type
       kind parameters, since mappings can always be specified to Fortran 
       types of default kind.

  Obviously, (i) makes it harder to implement the BIND approach for those
  Fortran compilers that do not support all C basic types. Disregarding all 
  other differences of the two approaches, this would favor MAP_TO because 
  it is the aim of a TR to keep the impact on overall compiler maintenance
  small. There is, however, no technical reason that a Fortran compiler
  should not support all basic types that the C compiler for the same 
  hardware supports, and users will definitely benefit from extending the 
  number of intrinsic kinds of the Fortran compiler to those types.

  Concerning (ii), it is clearly a relief if users need not carry KIND
  type parameters through their programs. But this is not a problem of
  interoperability of Fortran and C, it is caused by the Fortran rule
  that actual and dummy argument must match identically - see topic (V).

  In contrast to these two advantages of MAP_TO, I would like to point
  out some problems with the MAP_TO approach, which to my understanding 
  are of a more fundamental nature than the advantages above:

   (I) MAP_TO cannot handle C structs very well.

       A "recursive MAP_TO" (I'd prefer to call it a "nested" MAP_TO) has 
       been proposed by Jerry Wagener to extend MAP_TO to C structs, see 
       http://www.uni-karlsruhe.de/~SC22WG5/TR-C/Email/may06-01 and my
       replies in the same directory. I am not aware of a more detailed 
       specification of such nested MAP_TO, and I have some concerns about
       that mechanism as a whole:

       (1) MAP_TO replicates a struct mapping at each reference.

       Suppose we have the following C specifications:

         struct foo_type { int i; float f; };
         void foo1 ( struct foo_type arg1 ) { ... }
         void foo2 ( struct foo_type arg2 ) { ... }
         ...

       With the BIND approach, this can be mapped to

         MODULE FOO_HEADER
           USE ISO_C
           TYPE FOO_TYPE
             BIND(C)
             INTEGER(C_INT_KI) :: I ; REAL(C_FLOAT_KR) :: F
           END TYPE FOO_TYPE
         END MODULE FOO_HEADER

         INTERFACE
           BIND(C,"foo1") SUBROUTINE FOO1(ARG1)
             USE FOO_HEADER ; TYPE(FOO_TYPE) :: ARG1
           END SUBROUTINE FOO1
           BIND(C,"foo2") SUBROUTINE FOO2(ARG2)
             USE FOO_HEADER ; TYPE(FOO_TYPE) :: ARG2
           END SUBROUTINE FOO2
           ...
         END INTERFACE

       All interfaces with a "struct foo_type" argument only reference the 
       TYPE(FOO_TYPE), which is consistently defined in one place.
       With a MAP_TO approach, each interface has to specify a Fortran TYPE,
       and additionally the full MAP_TO for that struct:

         MODULE FOO_MODULE
           TYPE FRT_TYPE
             INTEGER :: I ; REAL :: F
           END TYPE FRT_TYPE
         END MODULE FOO_MODULE

         INTERFACE
           BIND(C,"foo1") SUBROUTINE FOO2(ARG1)
             USE FOO_MODULE ; TYPE(FRT_TYPE), MAP_TO(int;float) :: ARG1
           END SUBROUTINE FOO1              ! ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
           BIND(C,"foo2") SUBROUTINE FOO2(ARG2)
             USE FOO_MODULE ; TYPE(FRT_TYPE), MAP_TO(int;float) :: ARG2
           END SUBROUTINE FOO2              ! ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
           ...
         END INTERFACE

       This is error-prone: changing the C struct requires changing at least
       one Fortran TYPE (the MAP_TOs might map to different Fortran TYPEs for 
       ARG1 and ARG2), and one MAP_TO for each such "struct foo_type" dummy.


       (2) MAP_TO does not allow encapsulation of "struct" TYPEs in MODULEs

       Almost every API in C that Fortran may with to interface to comes
       with header files that contain, among others, struct definitions
       for derived types. The BIND approach uses a <bind-spec> within a
       Fortran TYPE definition to match the layout of struct and TYPE,
       that TYPE definition can be placed in a "header" module. As in the
       original C API, the TYPE name is all an application programmer needs
       to know to use the Fortran API.
       
       MAP_TO separates the definition of a Fortran TYPE (probably also
       in a "header" module) from the specification of its mapping (in
       the MAP_TO attribute for dummy arguments of that type). MAP_TO
       additionally requires the application programmer writing down the
       MAP_TO to know the layout of the struct/TYPE - not only its name.

       The important point is that this breaks the portability of the
       Fortran binding if variables of such type also appear as dummy
       arguments of _user_ procedures: with BIND everything is defined 
       in a central MODULE (which hopefully is provided by the vendor 
       of the package/API), whereas with MAP_TO the conversion rules 
       for a TYPE in the API-header are specified in the user's program!

       Suppose two vendors of a package use two different internal layouts of
       an opaque struct (with a documented name but "PRIVATE" components):

         MODULE api_header                    MODULE api_header
         ! Vendor ABC's header                ! Vendor XYZ's header
           TYPE api_type                        TYPE api_type
             INTEGER i ; REAL r                   REAL r ; INTEGER i
           END TYPE api_type                    END TYPE api_type
          CONTAINS                             CONTAINS
           SUBROUTINE api_proc(s)               SUBROUTINE api_proc(s)
            TYPE(api_type), &                    TYPE(api_type), &
              MAP_TO(int,float) :: s               MAP_TO(float,int) :: s
           END SUBROUTINE api_proc              END SUBROUTINE api_proc
         END MODULE api_header                END MODULE api_header

       Of course, both vendors specify MAP_TOs matching their own layout of
       the TYPE(api_type) structure for all procedures the API specifies.

       So the following program is portable:

         PROGRAM my_p
           USE api_header
           TYPE(api_type) :: s
           CALL api_proc(s)
         END PROGRAM my_p

       However, if a user wants to pass an object of TYPE(api_type)
       through a procedure interface that is _not_ provided by the vendor,
       a portablility problem arises:

         SUBROUTINE my_sub ( my_s )
           USE api_header
           TYPE(api_type), MAP_TO(int,float) :: my_s  !  tied to vendor ABC
           CALL api_proc(my_s)
         END SUBROUTINE my_sub

       will not work with vendor XYZ's implementation because the MAP_TO
       specified in MY_SUB is for vendor ABC's layout of TYPE(api_type). 
       Such a design of interoperability should be avoided, since copying
       details from the header files into the user's code will result in
       unportable code, which will be difficult to write and debug since 
       it requires knowledge of details in MODULE api_header that are not
       intended for the user of the API.


       (3) Handling nested structs with MAP_TO is clumsy and error-prone.

       Consider the following C code, where a struct has struct components:

         struct foo_subtype { double i; double j; double k; };
         struct foo_type { 
           float i; struct foo_subtype a; 
           float j; struct foo_subtype b;
           struct foo_subtype c;
         };
         void foo ( struct foo_type arg ) { ... }

       This could be mapped transparently with the BIND approach:

         MODULE FOO_HEADER
           USE ISO_C
           TYPE FOO_SUBTYPE
             BIND(C)
             REAL(C_DBLE_KR) :: I, J, K
           END TYPE FOO_SUBTYPE
           TYPE FOO_TYPE
             BIND(C)
             REAL(C_FLT_KR) :: I ; TYPE(FOO_SUBTYPE) :: A
             REAL(C_FLT_KR) :: J ; TYPE(FOO_SUBTYPE) :: B
             TYPE(FOO_SUBTYPE) :: C
           END TYPE FOO_TYPE
         END MODULE FOO_HEADER

         INTERFACE
           BIND(C,"foo") SUBROUTINE FOO(ARG)
             USE FOO_HEADER
             TYPE(FOO_TYPE) :: ARG
           END SUBROUTINE FOO
         END INTERFACE

       However, using MAP_TO to do this mapping would blow up the interface:

         MODULE FOO_MODULE
           TYPE FRT_SUBTYPE
             DOUBLE PRECISION :: I, J, K
           END TYPE FRT_SUBTYPE
           TYPE FRT_TYPE
             REAL :: I ; TYPE(FRT_SUBTYPE) :: A
             REAL :: J ; TYPE(FRT_SUBTYPE) :: B
             TYPE(FRT_SUBTYPE) :: C
           END TYPE FRT_TYPE
         END MODULE FOO_MODULE

         INTERFACE
           BIND(C,"foo") SUBROUTINE FOO(ARG)
             USE FOO_MODULE
             TYPE(FRT_TYPE), MAP_TO( float, (double, double, double),  &
      &                              float, (double, double, double),  &
      &                              (double, double, double)        ) :: ARG
           END SUBROUTINE FOO
         END INTERFACE

       This example again shows that the mapping of a struct should be
       tied to the Fortran TYPE definition. Anything else creates very
       complicated code, and the separation of TYPE definition (most likely
       in a "header" module) and mapping (in _each_ MAP_TO for dummy 
       arguments) is likely to cause bugs for complicated structs. 
       Such structs _do_ exist in APIs that Fortran might want to access...


  (II) MAP_TO cannot handle typedef.

       The typedef mechanism of C is very important to ensure the portability
       of application programming interfaces. A Fortran binding to an API in
       C should be able to deal with typedef-ed names - resolving the typedef
       names to "intrinsic" types requires knowledge of implementation details
       that are normally not specified in the API, and thus is non-portable.
       The BIND facility for derived types together with the proposed 
       <type-alias-stmt> can handle typedef in a transparent way.
       MAP_TO is unable to deal with typedef, since this would require the
       processor which parses the C types in the MAP_TO to be aware of all
       user- or API-defined type names.


  (III) MAP_TO does not handle C extern data objects.

       It has been requested both by X3J3 and by members of WG5 that 
       access to global data objects defined in C is provided. The MAP_TO
       mechanism has only been proposed for procedure interfaces, and
       extending it to variables is not a good idea. Since its semantics
       is that of a type cast (conversion), it may introduce huge run-time
       costs when accessing global C variables - almost every reference to
       a C data object would start up the MAP_TO machinery.


  (IV) MAP_TO cannot deal with self-referential structures.

       At present, both the HPFF approach and N1178 only define mappings
       for pointers of type void*. But N1178 can, should this be necessary,
       be extended to deal with more general C pointers, most importantly
       self-referential, dynamic data structures:

         TYPE LIST
           BIND(C)
           INTEGER(C_INT_KI)   :: DATA
           TYPE(list), POINTER :: NEXT_NODE
         END TYPE LIST

       would be a natural mapping for

         struct list {
           int data;
           struct list *next_node;
         };

       This is impossible with a MAP_TO solution, which does not include
       a type name and thus cannot specify self-referencial structs
       (at least, not in finite time and code size :-). Extensions as the
       one above may be needed if a C compiler represents a "struct list *"
       differently from a "void *" ...


   (V) Comments on MAP_TO's type/kind conversions at a procedure call

       In Fortran, actual argument type and type kind parameters must match
       exactly those of the corresponding dummy argument. This requires some
       typing for ALL applications that use non-default KINDs. Consider for
       example a library implemented like this:

         MODULE SOME_LIB
           INTEGER, PARAMETER :: WP = KIND(0.0D0)  !  instead of DOUBLE PREC.
          CONTAINS
           SUBROUTINE LIB_PROC ( A, B )
             REAL(WP), INTENT(IN)  :: A
             REAL(WP), INTENT(OUT) :: B
             B = 42.0_WP * A
           END SUBROUTINE LIB_PROC
         END MODULE SOME_LIB

       If an application program accesses SOME_LIB, care must be taken that
       the KIND used in it and the KINDs of the application match: For example

         SUBROUTINE MY_PROC ( X, Y )
           USE SOME_LIB
           REAL     :: X, Y
           REAL(WP) :: YY
           CALL LIB_PROC(REAL(X,KIND=WP), YY)
           Y = YY
         END SUBROUTINE MY_PROC

       would result if WP is not the default real kind. Since the above use of 
       a WP type kind is preferred over DOUBLE PRECISION, for example, similar
       applications with hand-coded conversions will probably become common 
       practice as Fortran 90/95 code bases increase. A good solution to this 
       problem would be to allow calls with non-matching arguments IF an 
       explicit interface is visible. In this case, the compiler could do the
       conversion, and the above example could read

         SUBROUTINE MY_F2000_PROC ( X, Y )
           USE SOME_LIB         !  compiler sees that dummy args are REAL(WP)
           REAL :: X, Y
           CALL LIB_PROC(X, Y)  !  compiler converts to/from REAL(WP)
         END SUBROUTINE MY_F2000_PROC

       (Exactly this has been allowed in C at the transition from K&R to ISO C.
        It may be more complicated in Fortran because of generic interfaces.)
       Linking the automatic conversion to the visibility of an explicit 
       interface (function prototype in C) seem to be natural. The rules for 
       conversion can be identical to those that are already in section 7.5
       of the standard: mapping X to A is similar to an A = X assignment.

       The HPFF proposal (mis-) uses MAP_TO to do such conversions at a
       procedure call, which I think is not the ideal way to solve this broad
       class of problems. Apart from the fact that the "dummy kind" may be
       non-existent in the current Fortran compiler (see (i) above), there is
       no difference between calling a Fortran or a C procedure. MAP_TO solves 
       only a small part of the problem, and because there is nothing in the
       Fortran standard which describes the "dummy argument C types", the
       detailed rules for type conversions with MAP_TO must be explicitly
       specified by the interoperability proposal. I am not aware of any
       document which contains this specification for the MAP_TO approach,
       and I fear that it will be a rather big task to do so.
       
       The fact that C has more than one representation method for (signed)
       integers, for example, means that KIND parameters are the natural way 
       to distinguish them in Fortran. Fortran's inflexibility concerning 
       non-matching kind type parameters should not be blamed on the BIND/KIND
       interoperability approach. Rather than specifying conversion/conformance
       rules both in section 7 of the standard and additionally/separately for 
       each possible MAP_TO conversion, I would prefer to simply tell the 
       programmer which kind type parameter designates C's "long double" type, 
       for example. If C has a basic type Fortran hasn't, it seems more natural
       to simply _provide_ this type in Fortran that trying to say in a Fortran
       document how data objects of this unknown type should be converted to
       a Fortran type. Providing a _general_ mechanism in Fortran to allow 
       procedure calls with non-matching arguments (if an explicit interface is
       visible) may be a good idea, but this is not a interoperability subject.
