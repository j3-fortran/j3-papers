Subject: Intrinsic types in CLASS IS type guard statements

NUMBER: 
TITLE: Intrinsic types in CLASS IS type guard statements
KEYWORDS: CLASS IS, type guard, SELECT TYPE, intrinsic type
DEFECT TYPE: 
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:
Consider the following program:

      PROGRAM foo

        CLASS(*), POINTER :: x
        INTEGER, TARGET :: i

        x => i
        SELECT TYPE (x)
          CLASS IS (INTEGER)
            PRINT *, 'How can INTEGER be a class?'
        END SELECT

      END

The description of a CLASS IS type guard statement refers to an
extension of the type specified.  This makes no sense for
nonextensible types.  C815 disallows all nonextensible derived types,
but nothing disallows intrinsic types, which are also nonextensible.

Was this program intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:
No, this program was not intended to be standard-conforming.  An edit
is supplied to correct this oversight.

EDITS:
All edits refer to 04-007.

[162:20+] C815.5 (R823) The <type-spec> in a CLASS IS
                 <type-guard-stmt> shall specify an extensible type.

DISCUSSION:
Paper 03-270 included this edit, but the edit appears to have been
accidentally omitted from the standard.  In the minutes for J3 meeting
#167 (paper 04-272r1), the following appears:

        It was noted that edits #7 through 9 in paper 03-270 from
        meeting #166 did not get included in the list of proposed
        edits for the FCD in paper 03-280.  Those edits will be
        included in what /edit proposes at this meeting.

However, there seems to have been no further processing of this edit.
