Subject: Fortran liaison report

The technical content of the next revision of Fortran, to be known
informally as Fortran 2015, was decided at the SC22/WG5 meeting in
London during 3-7 August 2015.

The details are in WG5 paper N2082, which in turn refers to other WG5
papers, and PL22.3 (formerly J3) papers.  WG5 papers are available from
http://www.nag.co.uk/sc22wg5/docs.html.  J3 papers are available from
http://j3-fortran.org/doc/year.  J3 papers' file names begin with a year
and a hyphen.

The WG5 paper for ISO/IEC TS 18508 is N2074.

The WG5 paper for ISO/IEC TS 29113 is N1942.

The next three meetings of PL22.3 (12-16 Oct, 8-12 Feb, 6-10 Jun) will
be devoted to proofreading the draft of ISO/IEC 1539-1.  We hope to
forward it to ISO for publication in 2016.

Suggestions for a revision of subclause B.5 of ISO/IEC 8652:2012,
concerning Fortran interoperability, have been forwarded to Tucker Taft.

Subject: Proposed changes to Subclause B.5
Date: 2015 October 12

Replace paragraph 18:

"Fortran intrinsic types are characterized by a parameter called a kind
type parameter.  If a kind type parameter is not specified, a
processor-dependent default is assumed.  The types Fortran_Integer,
Real, Double_Precision, Logical, Complex, and Fortran_Character are
compatible with the Fortran intrinsic types and kinds default integer,
default real, double precision, default logical, default complex, and
default character, respectively."

There is no mention of the Fortran ALLOCATABLE or POINTER attributes.
Unlike C pointers, Fortran pointers are strongly type constrained,
unless they are unlimited polymorphic pointers.  Also unlike C pointers,
Fortran pointers are "fat" in that if they are array pointers they
contain bounds information.  The target of an array pointer might be a
non-contiguous section of an array.  For example, consider an array A
with dimensions (10,10), and a two-dimensional pointer P.  A pointer
assignment statement of the form "P => A(3:7,4:6)" would associate the
noncontiguous section of A consisting of rows 3-7 and columns 4-6 with
the pointer P, which thereby has runtime bounds of (1:5,1:3).  Should
the Ada standard contemplate interoperating with Fortran pointers?
Fortran also defines a type C_PTR this is simply a C pointer.  Should
the Ada standard contemplate interoperating with Fortran objects of type
C_PTR?  If so, this should be mentioned in a paragraph after paragraph
19.  I don't know what to recommend.

Fortran allocatable objects are much more strongly constrained than
pointers.  They can be allocated and deallocated, but they are always
contiguous and are automatically deallocated when they go out of dynamic
scope.  As with Fortran pointers, descriptors of allocatable objects
that are arrays contain bounds and stride information.  I don't know
whether Ada has a type whose objects could be actual parameters that
correspond to Fortran dummy arguments with the ALLOCATABLE attribute,
unless the Ada processor is willing to conspire with a companion Fortran
processor to use the same storage allocator.  If the Ada standard should
contemplate this interoperability, it should be mentioned in a paragraph
after paragraph 19.  I don't know what to recommend.

An alternative to addressing these interoperability problems is to
mention Fortran's support for C interoperability, and to recommend that
an Ada program pretend that it is interoperating with C procedures when
it is in fact interoperating with Fortran procedures that are C
interoperable.  Something like

"It is possible for objects of other Ada types to be passed between Ada
and Fortran programs.  In a reference from an Ada program to a Fortran
subprogram, the Ada actual parameters shall be compatible with C (B.3),
the Fortran subprogram shall be described to the Ada program as if it
were a C function, and the Fortran subprogram shall be declared within
the Fortran program to have the BIND(C) attribute.  In a reference from
a Fortran program to an Ada subprogram, the Ada subprogram and its
formal parameters shall be compatible with C (B.3) and the Ada
subprogram shall be described to the Fortran program as if it were a C
function.  Refer to Clause 15 of the Fortran International Standard
(ISO/IEC 1539-1)."

A Fortran allocatable object could correspond to an Ada formal
parameter, provided the Fortran description of the Ada subprogram's
interface does not specify the parameter to be allocatable, and the Ada
subprogram's formal parameter is not of a dynamically allocatable type.
This probably doesn't need to be mentioned.  It ought to just work.

Fortran has polymorphic objects, but does not contemplate that these
interoperate with C.  Fortran's object-oriented system is based upon
Simula's.  The Fortran standard does not contemplate that polymorphic
objects can interoperate with C++ polymorphic objects.  It probably
doesn't make sense for the Ada standard to contemplate that objects of
tagged record types could interoperate with Fortran polymorphic
objects.  This should be mentioned in a paragraph after paragraph 19.
Something like

"There is no provision to interface objects of tagged record types with
Fortran polymorphic objects."

Components in Fortran derived types can have the POINTER or ALLOCATABLE
attribute.  If the Ada standard does not contemplate interoperating with
objects with these attributes, it should be mentioned in a paragraph
after paragraph 19 that there are no Ada record types whose objects can
interoperate with Fortran derived-type objects that have components with
these attributes.  Something like

"There are no Ada record types whose objects can interface with Fortran
derived-type objects that have components with the ALLOCATABLE or
POINTER attributes."

Fortran dummy arguments can be of assumed shape, which means that the
actual argument corresponding to an assumed-shape dummy argument is a
descriptor that provides bound and stride information.  The Fortran
standard now contemplates that assumed-shape dummy arguments can
interoperate with C parameters, in either direction.  C macros to
produce descriptors are described in Clause 15 of the Fortran standard.
I don't know what to recommend here.  If it is non contemplated that the
Ada standard should support this interoperability, it might be mentioned
that an Ada actual parameter cannot correspond to an assumed-shape
Fortran dummy argument, and in a reference from a Fortran program to an
Ada subprogram, the Ada formal parameter shall not be described as a
Fortran assumed-shape array.  This would result in copy-in/copy-out
argument passing if the Fortran actual argument is not contiguous.

Fortran dummy arguments can have the OPTIONAL attribute.  I don't know
whether Ada has an equivalent concept.

Within paragraph 21, in the second line, insert "nonstandard" between
"defines" and "types".  At the end of paragraph 21, insert a sentence
"The Fortran standard does not specify the values of kind type
parameters.  In particular, the value of a kind type parameter does not
necessarily specify the number of bytes occupied by objects of that
kind.  Therefore if a Fortran interface package contains declarations of
types with integer values for <n>, whether those values correspond to
Fortran kind type parameters with the same values depends upon the
Fortran processor."

(The notation <n> means "n" in italic font.)

I don't know what to do about paragraph 25.  Fortran provides two
attributes for derived types that affect the layout of components of
objects of types with those attributes.  The SEQUENCE attribute requires
components to be laid out in the order they appear in the type
definition, with no padding between them.  See subclause 4.5.2.3 of the
Fortran 2008 standard.  The BIND(C) attribute requires all the
components to be C interoperable, and that they be laid out as a
companion C processor would lay them out.  The Fortran standard does not
specify what this means.  The definition of a "companion" processor is
processor dependent.  Should an Ada actual parameter that is a data
object of a Fortran compatible record type correspond to a Fortran dummy
argument that has the SEQUENCE or BIND(C) attribute, or is the Ada
processor expected to know its companion Fortran processor's
derived-type component layout rules?  I don't know what to recommend.

In paragraph 26, replace "Fortran procedure" with "Fortran procedure's
dummy procedure".

Fortran has procedure pointers, which can be dummy procedures or
components of objects of derived type.  I don't know whether an
access-to-subprogram object can have a convention denotation, and if so
whether that ought to be mentioned in connection with associating an
access-to-subprogram object with a Fortran procedure pointer.  The
Fortran standard does not contemplate that Fortran procedure pointers
should interoperate with C function pointers.  Rather, Fortran provides
a C_FUNPTR type, and procedures to copy between that and Fortran
procedure pointers.  If the Ada standard does not contemplate a Fortran
convention for access-to-subprogram objects, this might also be swept
under the C interface rug.  Otherwise, at the end of paragraph 26, add a
sentence "An Ada parameter of access-to-subprogram type and Fortran
convention may correspond to a Fortran argument that is a procedure
pointer."  I assume Ada records can have access-to-subprogram
components, in which case also change the edit recommended above
concerning Fortran derived-type objects with ALLOCATABLE or POINTER
components by inserting "data" before "components".

Fortran types can have type-bound procedures.  I see no prospect for
objects of these types interoperating with Ada.  Fortran types can have
finalization subroutines.  I see no prospect for objects of these types
interoperating with Ada.  I don't know whether this deserves mention.
