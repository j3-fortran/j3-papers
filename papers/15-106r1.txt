Subject: Lifted restrictions from TS 29113

Reference: 15-007


1. Introduction

Fortran 2015, via the interoperability TS, relaxes several prohibitions
on the usage of noninteroperable arguments to the procedures in
ISO_C_BINDING.  The relaxing of these restrictions is not noted in the
Introduction; this applies to C_LOC, C_FUNLOC, C_F_POINTER, and
C_F_PROCPOINTER.

Secondly, with C_F_POINTER, although 8.1 states that this restriction
is removed, in fact it remains.  This is clearly an unintended defect.

Edits are supplied to correct these defects.


2. Example

It might be thought that since we made assumed-shape et al
"interoperable", this is a difference without a difference.  Here is a
trivial example that would still be prohibited by the current wording;
in particular, the call to C_F_POINTER is invalid.

  PROGRAM test
    USE Iso_C_Binding
    TYPE t
      REAL,POINTER :: p(:)
    END TYPE
    TYPE(t),TARGET :: x(100)
    CALL sub(C_LOC(x),SIZE(x))
  CONTAINS
    SUBROUTINE sub(a,n)
      TYPE(C_PTR) a
      TYPE(t),POINTER :: b(:)
      CALL C_F_POINTER(a,b,[n])
      IF (ASSOCIATED(b,x)) THEN
        PRINT *,'ok'
      ELSE
        STOP 'FAIL'
      END IF
    END SUBROUTINE
  END PROGRAM


3. Additional wordsmithing

The "X or its target" phrasing is unwieldy, and more so when it is
repeated more than once.  By changing to say that X is the effective
argument, the need for the "or its target" is removed.

The shape specification of FPTR is already repeated; instead of
repeating it a third time, we will move it outside of the Case
structure.


4. Edits to 15-007

[xvix] Introduction, bullet for TS 29113, append new sentences
  "The argument to C_LOC can be a noninteroperable array.
   The FPTR argument to C_F_POINTER can be a noninteroperable array
   pointer.
   The argument to C_FUNLOC can be a noninteroperable procedure.
   The FPTR argument to C_F_PROCPOINTER can be a noninteroperable
   procedure pointer.".
{Admit to the existence of these new features.  I have ordered them by
 semantics rather than alphabetically.}

[445:17] 15.2.3.3 C_F_POINTER, p3 Arguments, FPTR, initial paragraph,
         After "It is an INTENT (OUT) argument.",
         Insert (wordsmithed) sentence from [445:21-22]:
           "If FPTR is an array, its shape is specified by SHAPE and each
            lower bound is equal to 1.".

[445:20-22] 15.2.3.3 C_F_POINTER, p3 Arguments, FPTR, Case (i),
             Replace sentences
              "In this case, FPTR becomes pointer associated with the
               target of CPTR. If FPTR is an array, its shape is
               specified by SHAPE and each lower bound is 1.".
             with the following:
  "If the target T of CPTR is scalar, FPTR becomes pointer associated
   with T; if FPTR is an array, SHAPE shall specify a size of 1.  If T
   is an array, and FPTR is scalar, FPTR becomes associated with the
   first element of T.  If both T and FPTR are arrays, SHAPE shall
   specify a size that is less than or equal to the size of T, and
   FPTR becomes associated with the first PRODUCT(SHAPE) elements of T
   (this could be the entirety of T)."

[445:24] 15.2.3.3 C_F_POINTER, p3 Arguments, FPTR, Case (ii),
         After "FPTR shall be a nonpolymorphic"
         Delete "scalar".
{Remove inconsistent prohibition.}

[445:24] 15.2.3.3 C_F_POINTER, p3 Arguments, FPTR, Case (ii),
         After "noninteroperable" (on line 23),
         change "argument X," to "effective argument X,".

[445:25] Same case, next sentence,
         Delete "or its target if it is a pointer".

[445:27-28] Same case, Replace final sentence
              "FPTR becomes pointer associated with X
               or its target."
            with the following:
  "If X is scalar, FPTR becomes pointer associated with X; if FPTR is
   an array, SHAPE shall specify a size of 1.  If X is an array and
   FPTR is scalar, FPTR becomes associated with the first element of
   X.  If both X and FPTR are arrays, SHAPE shall specify a size that
   is less than or equal to the size of X, and FPTR becomes associated
   with the first PRODUCT(SHAPE) elements of X (this could be the
   entirety of X)."
{Specify precisely what happens in all the possible cases.  Note that
 X is required not to have been a zero-sized array, so there is always
 at least one data object there for FPTR to become associated with.
 Of course we could require arrayness(FPTR)==arrayness(X) or even
 PRODUCT(SHAPE)==SIZE(X), but that seems excessively strict.}
