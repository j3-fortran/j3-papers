1. Introduction
===============

This paper contains the formal specifications & syntax for readonly
components. This supersedes the specifications outlined by previous papers,
as subgroup discussion revealed a more flexible feature set was needed to
meet competing user requirements.

Previous protected-components specifications fell into one of two camps.
Papers 18-265 and 20-106 envisioned components inaccessible for *direct*
modification outside the module in which the parent type was defined, but
did allow a type containing a protected potential subobject to appear in a
variable-definition context. These papers propose an access specifier
roughly in-between PUBLIC and PRIVATE, by effectively prohibiting the name
of a protected component from appearing in a variable-definition context,
not protecting the variable itself. Other papers, 19-135r1, 19-161,
19-214r1, and 20-121 offered stronger protection, protecting variables
themselves from being modified by virtually any means outside the module
where that component was defined.

This paper--and its partner paper--aims to satisfy both parties by teasing
apart the competing goals into two separate features: readonly components,
and restricted types. Readonly components provide an access specification
allowing code outside the module defining the type to read, but not
*directly* modify components. These components will not impose any
restrictions on the type containing them, beyond anything that might be
imposed by the analogous PRIVATE or PUBLIC access specifiers. Restricted
types may be used to protect the data from appearing in variable-definition
contexts.

Although this is a formal syntax paper, the syntax will be defined by prose
and by example, not by BNF, to aid comprehension.


2. Use Cases
============

Use cases have been presented in previous papers (18-265, 20-106,
19-214r1). Here is a summary; for more, refer to those papers.

Readonly components are useful in any situation where a user would want a
derived type to expose a large dataset for reading, but does not want the
client to modify the data except through provided procedures. They may also
want the client to be able to store copies of these objects or deallocate
them, while still controlling their internal consistency. Furthermore, a
"getter" routine would require an expensive copy of the data, thus is
suboptimal. Readonly components allow the programmer to design a derived
type API which reflects the intended use of certain objects -- exposing
components without also giving the ability to modify them directly.

For example, a CFD application's mesh may contain a large connectivity
dataset:

    type :: mesh
      integer, allocatable, readonly :: nbr(:)
    contains
      procedure :: init
    end type mesh

A client must be able to create and initialize this mesh object through
provided procedures. They might need copies to preserve some history. But
the client absolutely must not be able to modify the nbr component
directly. To summarize:

    subroutine ex1()
      type(mesh) :: m ! local variables allowed
      type(mesh), allocatable :: history(:) ! local allocatables allowed

      call m%init() ! modifying through module routines allowed
      print *, m%nbr ! reading readonly components allowed
      allocate(history(1)) ! local allocation allowed
      history(1) = m ! intrinsic assignment allowed
      call read(m%nbr) ! passing readonly component as intent(in) allowed
      call new_mesh(m) ! passing object as intent(out) or intent(inout)
                       ! allowed

      m%nbr(1) = huge(1) ! FAIL: modifying readonly component not allowed
      call change(m%nbr(1)) ! FAIL: intent(out) and intent(inout) not
                            ! allowed on readonly components
      m = mesh(nbr = [huge(1)]) ! FAIL: setting readonly component
                                ! via structure constructor not allowed
      allocate(m%nbr(1)) ! FAIL
      deallocate(m%nbr)  ! FAIL

      ! automatic deallocation & finalization allowed
      ! even without a user-defined finalizer
    end subroutine ex1


3. Specifications
=================

To help keep a record of how specs have changed and to aid discussion,
specification labels are preserved from papers 20-121 and 19-214r1.

B. The name of a readonly component shall not appear in a
   variable-definition context, except within the module wherein its type
   is defined.

G. A readonly component or a subobject of a readonly component can only
   be argument associated with an INTENT(IN) dummy, even if the referenced
   procedure is in the module in which the type is defined.

H. A readonly component or subobject of a readonly component cannot be
   the target in a pointer assignment outside the module, as that would
   lose the protection.
   - Here I think it would be valuable to somehow expose an immutable
     reference, which could tie into the const-pointer proposals.

I. A readonly component or subobject of a readonly component cannot be
   explicitly allocated or deallocated except within the module in which
   the type is defined.
   - Otherwise it's too easy to bypass the protection.
   - Allocating/deallocating a type containing a readonly component is
     still permitted, provided it's not subject to some other rule.
   - Automatic deallocation on scope exit will occur as it would for any
     non-readonly component.

J1. A dummy variable of a type with a readonly component can be INTENT(IN)
    or INTENT(INOUT) or INTENT(OUT) in any procedure anywhere, unless it's
    subject to some other rule.

L1. No intrinsic assignment to a readonly component or subobject thereof,
    outside the module in which the readonly component is defined. (cf.
    19-135r1)
    - This does not prohibit intrinsic assignment to a type containing a
      readonly component. It is only meant to prevent the readonly
      component from being modified by name.

M1. A function defined outside the module may have a result variable of a
    type with a readonly component.

N. A structure constructor outside the module in which the type is defined
   is allowed if and only if no value is supplied for any readonly
   component (otherwise this would subvert the module's control over what
   values are acceptable in the readonly component).
   - This describes the same user-facing behavior for READONLY and PRIVATE
     components. However, the logic in the standard must be different.
     C7102 and 7.5.4.8p2 prevent a structure constructor from specifying
     a private component by restricting access to the name. For a READONLY
     component, the name is accessible, yet we still prohibit setting the
     value of such a component outside the module where the parent type is
     defined.

P1. Readonly components are inherited through type extension.
    - In this regard, READONLY is like PUBLIC, not PRIVATE.
    - This is chosen because a readonly component is visible, like a PUBLIC
      component, and thus is part of the API provided by a parent type.

R. Type-wide default readonly status, like PRIVATE, is provided. Default
   is PUBLIC, unchanged from the current standard. READONLY statement
   changes the default. Attributes in a component definition stmt confirm
   or override the default.

U. SEQUENCE and BIND(C) types shall not have readonly components.
   - This includes any level of component selection, because non-SEQUENCE
     types are not allowed in SEQUENCE, and similarly BIND(C)).

AA. A component may be READONLY or PRIVATE or PUBLIC, but not a
    combination of more than one of these attributes.


4. Syntax
=========

One may add the READONLY attribute to component definitions.

    type :: foo
      real, readonly :: a
      real, private :: b
      real, public :: c
    end type foo

The requirement R allows a type-wide READONLY status, which may be
overridden for an individual component using another access specifier.

    type :: foo
      readonly
      real, private :: a
      real :: b
    end type foo


5. Comments
===========

5.1 Alternative keywords straw votes

There have been many keyword suggestions for this feature. Which should we
go with?

KEYWORD-1: READONLY (YES/NO/UNDECIDED)
KEYWORD-2: PROTECTED (YES/NO/UNDECIDED)
KEYWORD-3: LIMITED (YES/NO/UNDECIDED)
KEYWORD-4: VISIBLE (YES/NO/UNDECIDED)

5.2 Shouldn't we allow both readonly+private and readonly+public together?

Previous incarnations of "protected" components behaved differently than
what is proposed here. The presence of one of those protected components in
a type definition would also enforce all the restrictions of a restricted
type on the entire object. Hence, a component which was both protected and
private would have the useful (or onerous) side-effect of restricting the
type.

In the current form of readonly components, the side-effects are moved to
an explicit choice in the form of restricted types. Thus there is no longer
a practical benefit to combining private+readonly specifiers.

However there's a philosophical argument for making "readonly" a choice
independent of "public/private": "public/private" control access to the
name, while "readonly" controls the ability to "writability" of the
component. But since there's no practical benefit, I advocate three
mutually-exclusive options: private, readonly, and public.

Straw vote: Should readonly be used in combination with public/private, or
should it be a third mutually exclusive option? (mutually exclusive / in
combination / undecided)
