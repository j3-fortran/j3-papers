The editor has pointed out an ambiguity in the description of successful 
execution of a LOCK statement with an ACQUIRED_LOCK= specifier.

Edit

[193:16-17] In 6.5.6 LOCK and UNLOCK statements, replace the second 
sentence of para 3 by

"If the lock variable is already locked by a different image, successful 
execution of a LOCK statement with an ACQUIRED_LOCK= specifier leaves 
the lock variable unchanged and causes the scalar logical variable to 
become defined with the value false."
