Hotel and nearby amenities:

  1. The hotel provides van transportation to/from the hotel to/from
     anywhere in town for members of the Fortran group and their
     families or guests staying in the reserved block, but it needs
     to be arranged in advance.

  2. All reserved rooms are one or two bedroom suites with separate
     sleeping and living areas, bathroom, and kitchen.  The kitchen
     is fully equipped with refrigerator, stove, microwave, dish
     washer, dishes, cookware, and utensils.

  3. King size beds in all bedrooms.

  4. Complimentary local telephone calls with guest voicemail. The
     hotel provides free local telephone service and connections to
     toll free long distance numbers.  However, the surcharges for
     long distance calls and international calls made through the
     hotel operator can be large.  It is recommended that all long
     distance and international calls being placed from your hotel
     room be made using a prepaid calling card.  Such prepaid calling
     cards can be purchased very inexpensively from many department
     stores, convenience stores, and discount buying clubs.  There
     are no additional hotel surcharges on either domestic long
     distance or international calls made with prepaid calling cards.

     high speed internet access connections in the meeting room. Note
     that the internet connections are typically in the living area. 
     Some rooms have wireless, but just to be safe, bring a 10 - 25
     foot CAT-5 or CAT-6 patch cable to connect your computer to the
     RJ-45 connector.  Some rooms have a hub on the desk; otherwise,
     look behind the television, behind the desk, or behind the sofa.
     Although most rooms have several RJ-45 connectors, only one
     works, so if the one you find doesn't work, look for another one
     before calling the front desk.  J3 has a wireless hub and a
     multiport hub for use in the meeting room.
