From:      Bill Long
Subject:   A.1.3 Example code
Date: 2011 June 13
Reference: WG5/N1835, 11-176, 09-184

Discussion:
-----------

Several people external to WG5, and several members of the committee,
have proposed that in addition to ATOMIC_DEFINE and ATOMIC_REF it is
very useful to add an atomic read-modify-write intrinsic. The most
basic of those in both theoretical works and also practical
implementations is the atomic compare-and-swap (CAS) intrinsic.

The basic operation of this intrinsic is:
   atomic_cas (atom, old, compare, new)
which performs atomically:
   old = atom
   if (old == compare) atom  = new

Paper 09-184 had proposed adding an atomic compare and swap
routine. At the time, it was decided to defer that feature to the
Coarray TR.

The following further atomic subroutines are suggested:
atomic_add
atomic_fadd
atomic_and
atomic_fand
atomic_or
atomic_for
atomic_xor
atomic_fxor

where the 'f' versions are the "fetch_and_" versions of the ones with
out the 'f'.  These have existed (with different spelling) in the Cray
coarray implementation from the beginning due to specific customer
demands.  All take integer arguments.  Having standardized and
portable names would be good.


Edits to 11-176:
----------------

[9:17+] In 4.2 Standard generic intrinsic procedures, add a new line
for the A Class column identifier, aligned with the text in [9:18]:

"     A indicates that the procedure is an atomic subroutine,"


[9:19+] Add 9 entries to Table 4.1, alphabetically:

"ATOMIC_ADD  (ATOM, VALUE)      A  Add values atomically.

 ATOMIC_AND  (ATOM, VALUE)      A  Bitwise AND values atomically.

 ATOMIC_CAS  (ATOM, OLD,        A  Conditionally swap values
              COMPARE, NEW)        atomically.

[10:1+] At the beginning of 4.3 Specifications of the standard
intrinsic procedures, add these new subclauses:

"4.3.Xa  ATOMIC_ADD (ATOM, VALUE)

 Description. Add values atomically.

 Class.  Atomic subroutine.

 Arguments.

 ATOM shall be scalar and of type integer with kind ATOMIC_INT_KIND,
          where ATOMIC_INT_KIND is a named constant in the intrinsic
          module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV. It is an INTENT(INOUT)
          argument. ATOM becomes defined with the value ATOM + VALUE.

 VALUE shall be scalar and of type integer. It is an INTENT(IN)
          argument.

 Example. CALL ATOMIC_ADD (I[3], 1) causes I on image 3 to become
          defined with the value I + 1.


 4.3.Xb  ATOMIC_AND (ATOM, VALUE)

 Description. Bitwise AND values atomically.

 Class.  Atomic subroutine.

 Arguments.

 ATOM shall be scalar and of type integer with kind ATOMIC_INT_KIND,
          where ATOMIC_INT_KIND is a named constant in the intrinsic
          module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV. It is an INTENT(INOUT)
          argument. ATOM becomes defined with the value IAND(ATOM,
          INT(VALUE,ATOMIC_INT_KIND)).

 VALUE shall be scalar and of type integer. It is an INTENT(IN)
          argument.

 Example. CALL ATOMIC_AND (I[3], 1) causes I on image 3 to become
          defined with the value IAND(I,1).


 4.3.Xc ATOMIC_CAS (ATOM, OLD, COMPARE, NEW)

 Description. Conditionally swap values atomically.

 Class.  Atomic subroutine.

 Arguments.

 ATOM shall be scalar and of type integer with kind ATOMIC_INT_KIND or
           of type logical with kind ATOMIC_LOGICAL_KIND, where
           ATOMIC_INT_KIND and ATOMIC_LOGICAL_KIND are the named
           constants in the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV. It is an
           INTENT (INOUT) argument. If the value of ATOM is equal to
           the value of COMPARE, ATOM becomes defined with the value
           of INT (NEW, ATOMIC_INT_KIND) if it is of type integer, and
           with the value of NEW if it of type logical.

 OLD shall be scalar and of the same type as ATOM. It is an INTENT
           (OUT) argument. It becomes defined with the value of INT
           (ATOMC, KIND (OLD)) if ATOM is of type integer, and the
           value of ATOMC if ATOM is of type logical, where ATOMC has
           the same type and KIND as ATOM and has the value of ATOM
           used for the compare operation.

 COMPARE  shall be scalar and of the same type and kind as ATOM.
          It is an INTENT(IN) argument.

 NEW      shall be scalar and of the same type as ATOM. It is an
          INTENT(IN) argument.


 Example. CALL ATOMIC_CAS(I[3], OLD, Z, 1) causes I on image 3 to
          become defined with the value 1 if its value is that of Z,
          and OLD to become defined with the value of I on image 3
          prior to the comparison."


 4.3.Xd  ATOMIC_FADD (ATOM, VALUE, OLD)

 Description. Add values atomically, with fetch.

 Class.  Atomic subroutine.

 Arguments.

 ATOM shall be scalar and of type integer with kind ATOMIC_INT_KIND,
          where ATOMIC_INT_KIND is a named constant in the intrinsic
          module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV. It is an INTENT(INOUT)
          argument. ATOM becomes defined with the value ATOM + VALUE.

 VALUE shall be scalar and of type integer. It is an INTENT(IN)
          argument.

 OLD shall be scalar of the same type and kind as ATOM. It is an
          INTENT(OUT) argument. OLD becomes define with the value of
          ATOM that was added to VALUE to produce the result ATOM
          value.

 Example. CALL ATOMIC_ADD (I[3], 1, Iold) causes I on image 3 to
          become defined with the value 4 and the Iold to become
          defined with the value 3 if the value of I[3] was 3 when the
          addition operation executed.

          argument. ATOM becomes defined with the value IAND(ATOM,
          INT(VALUE,ATOMIC_INT_KIND)).

 VALUE shall be scalar and of type integer. It is an INTENT(IN)
          argument.

 OLD shall be scalar of the same type and kind as ATOM. It is an
          INTENT(OUT) argument. OLD becomes define with the value of
          ATOM that was bitwise anded with VALUE to produce the
          result ATOM value.

 Example. CALL ATOMIC_FAND (I[3], 1, Iold) causes I on image 3 to
          become defined with the value 1 and the value of Iold to
          become defined with the value 3 if the value of I[3] was 3
          when the bitwise AND operation executed.

          ATOM value.

 Example. CALL ATOMIC_FOR (I[3], 1, Iold) causes I on image 3 to
          become defined with the value 3 and the value of Iold to
          become defined with the value 2 if the value of I[3] was 2
          when the bitwise OR operation executed.
