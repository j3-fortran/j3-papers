Discussion

For the IEEE derived types, [440:23-24] states: 
"No direct component of any of these types is allocatable or a pointer."

For C_PTR and C_FUNPTR, [474:2-3] "No direct component of either of
these types is allocatable or a pointer."


UTI 98 (page 440) says: "If it is found to be correct on review, all that is
needed is to delete this UTI." and "This also affects TYPE(C_PTR) and 
TYPE(C_FUNPTR); the text the editor added to these (see 15.3.3) also needs
to be reviewed and accepted before deleting this UTI."


We agree.
