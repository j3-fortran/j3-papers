Discussion:

The current words allow an associate selector to be a co-indexed
object and a co-array, but do not specify whether the associate name
remains a co-array and whether it is a co-indexed object. We believe
that the associate name should have the same co-rank and co-bounds as
the associated selector.

Subgroup believes that we should forbid co-indexed objects as the
selector. There are two ways to treat co-indexed selectors. Both have
problems.

Option 1:
 
If we allowed co-indexed objects as selectors, the associate name
would be "co-indexed". This would require expanding the concept of
"co-indexed object". It would effectively hide the fact that the
variable is on another image inside the ASSOCIATE block which is
contrary to one of the basic design principles of co-arrays.

Option 2:

A co-indexed selector could be treated in the same way as a variable
with a vector subscript. This is effectively the "copy-in"
option. However, this option would prevent the associate name from
appearing in a variable definition context.  This too seriuosly limits
the usefulness.


Edits:
-----------

[178:20+] Add a new constraint:
"C801a (R804) A <selector> shall not be a co-indexed object."

[179:2] Change "same rank" to "same rank and co-rank"

[179:5] Before the sentence beginning with "The associating entity
has", add a new sentence:

"The co-bounds of each co-dimension of the associating entity are the
same as those of the associated selector."

[192:3+] Add a new constraint:
"C832a (R847) A <selector> shall not be a co-indexed object."
