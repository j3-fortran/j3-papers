Edits against 02-007r1:

F95

Page 3 [3:32+] 87, 92 Subclause 1.5.1 Add these extra items at the end on 1.5.1:

(3)Earlier standards specified that if the second argument to MOD or MODULO was
zero, the result was processor dependent. This standard specifies that the second
argument shall not be zero.

(4) The PAD= specifier in the INQUIRE statement in this standard returns the value
UNDEFINED if there is no connection or the connection is for unformatted input/output.
The previous standard specified YES.
