Subject:     Interpretation: Clause 16 and volatile variables
Date: 2007 July 30


NUMBER: F03/0099
TITLE: Clause 16 does not account for volatile variable
KEYWORDS: volatile, defined, undefined
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress


QUESTION:

Should the various lists in clause 16 that describe definition and
association be modified to include the effects of volatile variables?

In particular, 16.4.2.1.1 through 16.4.2.1.2 do not mention the fact
that pointer association status can be volatile and change by other
means.

16.5.4 says "all other variables are initially undefined.?  Can a
volatile variable be initially defined by other means?

16.5 (26) says volatile variables "become defined", but they also can
become undefined, by other means.

Allocatable volatile variables can become allocated or unallocated by
other means also.
