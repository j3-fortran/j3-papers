Discussion

When making the edits from 07-323r1, the editor deleted "for data"
from its definition of "collective subroutine":
     "intrinsic subroutine that is invoked on a team of images to
     perform a calculation for data on those images and assign the
     value of the result on all of them".
He considers it to be incorrect because 'the cross-team reduction
operates using data that is not local to the image (otherwise the
result would necessarily be different on each image!)'.

We disagree that deletion is appropriate. For example, consider a run
with 4 images and the team for the collective consisting of images 1
and 2. The original text was intended to say that data (combined as a
group) from images 1 and 2 are involved in the collective, which is
correct. The editor read it as image 1 uses data from image 1 and
image 2 uses data from image 2, which is not correct. The new wording
does not constrain the data to be on the team images (saying nothing
about data), so it does allow that the execution on images 1 and 2
could involve data from images 3 and 4.  This is critically wrong
since issues of memory synchronization are involved in the collective
and that synchronization applies only to the images in the team.
Access outside the team involves semantic hazard.

The editor also considers it to be ungrammatical.

Here is an alternative.


Edits to J3/07-008

[12:7] In 2.1.22 collective subroutine, replace the definition by

     "intrinsic subroutine that is invoked on a team of images to
     perform a calculation involving data on all those images
     and assign the value of the result on all of them (13.1)".

[343:15-17] In 13.1 Classes of intrinsic procedure, replace the first
     sentence of para. 4 by

     "A collective subroutine is one that is invoked on a team of
     images to perform a calculation involving data on all those
     images and assign the value of the result on all of them."
