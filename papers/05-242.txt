1. Introduction

This document describes the differences between 05-008 and 05-008r1.

2. New entries for "B. Agreed post-publication edits"

(1) [throughout] Garish colouring of PDF version removed by making the
    hyperlinks black.
    {ISO Secretariat might be more likely to accept our PDF if we don't go
     mad with colour all over it!}

(2) [xiii] Replaced text with boilerplate ready for addition of new
    explanations.
    Note: [xiii:4] had a typo "1.6.2" for "1.6.1" (actually a reference typo
          "90" for "95"), which I have fixed when replacing the boilerplate.
    {I did this instead of the rejected item for this page.}

(3) [3:10-] Inserted new compatibility section for Fortran 2003 with the
            obvious title and text.
    {Just to get the Intro right without LaTeX complaints.}

(4) [3:11-12] deleted "the preceding ... Standard,"
    {Fortran 95 will no longer be the preceding standard.}

(5) [209:13] Change "flush statement" to "FLUSH statement".
    {This was a typo - all other occurrences are properly capitalised.}

(6) [331:16-17] Change all forward and backward double quotes to forward single
                quotes.
    {The backwards quotes were just typos - they should all have been forwards
     anyway.  But our style is to use single quotes for char literals anyway.}

(7) [334:21-22] Change all forwards and backwards double quotes to forwards
                single quotes.

(8) [395:28] Typo "CPTR" -> "CPTR%PX."
    {This was already in the .tex file, but % is the LaTeX comment char,
     which is why it didn't appear in the printed document.  (CPTR%PX appears
     several times, and just this once the backslash quote was missing.)}

(9) [112:26] Change reference for "allocation transfer procedure" to point to
             the actual definition of MOVE_ALLOC (13.7.82) instead of to the
             unhelpful one-line paragraph.
    {[415:3] got this right.  While (13.5.16) is also nominally correct, it
     contains no helpful information, so the user ended up looking for it
     alphabetically anyway.}

3. Modified "B. Agreed" entries

(1) [73:11] Insert space between "(R504)" and "<initialization>".
    changed to
    [73:11] Insert "An" between "(R504)" and "<initialization>".
    {This fits the style we use elsewhere better, and avoids beginning a
     sentence with a syntax item name (which has an initial lowercase letter).}

4. Entries moved from "B. Agreed" to "F. Rejected"

(1) Q. [xiii, item(3)]: "complex" => "complicated".
    A. This page will be replaced in F2008, so making this change is a waste of
       time.

(2) Q. [331:16-17] Change 'MAX((/"A","Z"/),(/"BB","Y "/))'
                   to     'MAX(["A","Z"],["BB","Y "])'.
    A. This is an inline example; in C13 we use square brackets mostly for
       matrices (not just arrays) in our inline examples.
       There are other uses of (/ /) in that paragraph which are not changed.
       Furthermore, it would also make it inconsistent with MIN.
       I prefer a foolish consistency.

5. Revised rationale for [117] edit group.

The rationale now reads "Note 7.1 (Examples of a <primary>) uses syntax terms
that do not appear in the definition of a <primary>, and does not...".
(Previously the rationale said these were non-existent; they are not, they
are just not part of the syntax rule being "exampled".)

6. Additional items for "C. Edits under consideration"

(1) [368:22] could be read as defining IEEE_OTHER_VALUE as being in the
    "normal" class.

(2) [269:9] Delete "and it shall not extend beyond the end of that sequence".
    {This merely duplicates [272:21-22], and there is already a forward ref to
    that in the sentence.  Moreover, we don't duplicate the "shall not extend"
    requirement for non-character, so doing it for character is inconsistent.}

7. State of 007 source files

All category A and B items from 05-008r1 have been applied.
All interpretations from Corrigendum 1 have been applied.
Fixed a typo in F03/0010 ("both ... argument" -> "both ... arguments").
