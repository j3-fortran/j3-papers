All edits are expressed relative to J3/02-007r3:

{* Much of 6.3.1.1 is "broken" in that it does not allow for the
features added by the ALLOCATABLE TR, so some kind of repair would
be needed there even if the rest of this paper is rejected. *}
[110:24-25] Replace first sentence of the paragraph with
"The status of an allocatable variable becomes <<allocated>> if it
is allocated by an ALLOCATE statement, if it is allocated during
assignment, or if it is given that status by the allocation transfer
procedure (13.5.15+1)."
[111:2] After first sentence of the paragraph, insert
"The status of an allocatable variable becomes unallocated if it is
deallocated (6.3.3) or if it is given that status by an allocation
transfer procedure."
[111:4] After "argument", insert "corresponding to a nonallocatable
	dummy argument,"
[111:8-9] Replace last two sentences of paragraph with
	"The status may change during the execution of the program."
	{* Cf. 111:14 and 111:16 *}
[287:15] "subroutine MVBITS is" -> "subroutines MOVE_ALLOC and
         MVBITS are"
[287:15+1] After "The", insert "effects of MOVE_ALLOC are limited
	to its arguments.  The remaining"
[293:25+] Insert "
13.5.14+1  Allocation transfer procedures
MOVE_ALLOC(FROM,TO)     Transfers an allocation from one
                         allocatable object to another"
[332:28+] Insert text

13.7.79+1  MOVE_ALLOC(FROM,TO)

Description. Transfers an allocation from one allocatable object
to another.

Class.  Subroutine.

Arguments.

FROM    may be of any type and rank.  It shall be allocatable.  It
         is an INTENT(INOUT) argument.

TO      shall be type compatible (5.1.1.8) with FROM and have the
         same rank.  It shall be allocatable.  It shall be
	 polymorphic if FROM is polymorphic.  It is an INTENT(OUT)
         argument.  Each nondeferred parameter of the declared type
	 of TO shall have the same value as the corresponding
	 parameter of the declared type of FROM.

The allocation status of TO remains unallocated if FROM is
unallocated on entry to MOVE_ALLOC.  Otherwise, TO becomes
allocated with dynamic type, type parameters, array bounds, and
value identical to those that FROM had on entry to MOVE_ALLOC.

If TO has the TARGET attribute, any pointer associated with FROM
on entry to MOVE_ALLOC becomes correspondingly associated with TO.
If TO does not have the TARGET attribute, the pointer association
status of such a pointer becomes undefined.

The allocation status of FROM becomes unallocated.

Example.

       REAL,ALLOCATABLE :: GRID(:),TEMPGRID(:)
       ...
       ALLOCATE(GRID(-N:N)       ! initial allocation of GRID
       ...
! "reallocation" of GRID to allow intermediate points
       ALLOCATE(TEMPGRID(-2*N:2*N)) ! allocate bigger grid
       TEMPGRID(::2)=GRID ! distribute values to new locations
       CALL MOVE_ALLOC(TO=GRID,FROM=TEMPGRID)
                         ! old grid is deallocated because TO is
                         ! INTENT(OUT), and GRID then "takes over"
                         ! new grid allocation

Note 13.14+1

It is expected that the implementation of allocatable objects will
typically involve descriptors to locate the allocated storage;
MOVE_ALLOC could then be implemented by transfering the contents
of the descriptor for FROM to the descriptor for TO and clearing
the descriptor for FROM.

[404:29+] Insert "
(2+1) The allocation transfer procedure (13.5.15+1) is executed
       with an argument that is associated with the pointer, except
       under certain circumstances described in 13.7.79+1."
[412:21+] Insert "
(9+1) When the allocation transfer procedure (13.5.15+1) causes the
       allocation status of an allocatable entity to become
       unallocated, the entity becomes undefined."
