NO, we've chosen to allow more continuation lines instead.  We feel that longer 
lines will not be readable by humans (including when listed in error messages).  
We recognize that preprocessors will need to be aware of the 132 limit, but they 
would need to also be aware of any other limit and do some sort of special 
casing for the line-too-long case.

NO, we have chosen to standardize a more Fortran-like preprocessor as a separate 
standard.

NO, this was not on the agreed list of features for F2K and is too large to add 
at this time.  We will suggest that it be added to the list of features for 
consideration for the next revision of the Fortran standard.

NO, not as specified.  However, we have added a set of intrinsic functions that 
will provide the same functionality as the argc/argv method.  See section 
13.5.17, command_argument_count, get_command, get_command_argument.

NO, adding an integer return value was not part of the requirements for F2k.  We 
believe it is too system dependent for consideration at this time.  We will
suggest that it be added to the list of features for consideration for the next 
revision of the Fortran standard.

The get_command and get_command_argument intrinsic functions provide this 
capability.

NO, this was not a requirement for F2K.  Callback routines do not fit well into 
the Fortran calling sequence model which is neither call-by-address nor call-by-
value and which allows entities to become undefined when they go out of scope.
