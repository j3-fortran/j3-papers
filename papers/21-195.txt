From: Malcolm Cohen
Subject: US-27
Date: 2021-October-20

In WG5 N2170, Resolutions from the August 2019 Meeting in Tokyo, WG5
resolved to do US27.

US27: Syntax to specify that the target of a dummy argument pointer is not
      to be changed (INTENT applies to the pointer, not its target.

On examining and debating this feature, J3/DATA subgroup concluded that a
pointer that did not permit modification of its target was a feature that
was valuable independently of it being a dummy argument, and thus should
not be part of the INTENT attribute.

Further discussions and development suggested that a modification of the
POINTER attribute itself would be appropriate. However, we did not reach
consensus on the syntax and some of the edge cases in the time we had
allowed for development of this feature.

At this time, the feature is not sufficiently developed for inclusion in
this revision of the standard, and attempting to put it in at the last
minute would likely leads to problems and inconsistencies, even assuming
we could reach consensus on the basics.

Therefore, we recommend that this feature not be part of this revision
(Fortran 202x), but should be considered for the next revision (F202y).
