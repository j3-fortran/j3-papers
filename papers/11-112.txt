DISCUSSION

Unresolved Technical Issue TR2 of N1838 points out that the first
sentence of para 2 of 5.2.3 CFI_dim_t makes an incorrect assumption.
The paragraph is applicable in all cases where the type component of a
descriptor for an object indicates that the object is of character type.
An edit is supplied to correct this

EDIT to N1838:

[10:20-21] In 5.2.3 CFI_dim_t, para 2, lines 1-2, replace
"If the actual argument is of type CHARACTER, or is of assumed type
eventually associated with an actual argument of type CHARACTER"
by
"If the type component of a descriptor for an actual argument indicates
that the type is a character type".
