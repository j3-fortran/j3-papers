Subject: Clarifications for SYNC, QUERY

References: 06-007

Following some comments from Van and discussion in subgroup B, we
propose clarifications of text concerning SYNC_IMAGES and QUERY.

-------------------
Note 8.36 does not explain if there is a difference between
SYNC_IMAGES(*) being executed on all images and SYNC_ALL. Here is an
attempt to make it more informative and clarify the reason for having
both SYNC_IMAGES(*) and SYNC_ALL:

202:0+3 In Note 8.36, add to the end of the second sentence:
"for each other." -> "until all other images execute a SYNC_ALL
statement, while SYNC_IMAGES causes an image to wait only until the
images specified in the image set execute a corresponding SYNC_IMAGE
statement. Execution of a SYNC_IMAGES(*) statement on all images
achieves the same effect as execution of a SYNC_ALL statement, however,
using a SYNC_ALL statement provides useful documentation and might
be more efficient on certain platforms."
Then split off "In the following example" as a separate paragraph.

-------------------
The text describing QUERY and when it is satisfied etc. is very
difficult to understand. This is an attempt to rewrite it:

[205: 5-25]
A QUERY statement is blocking if and only if it has no READY=
specifier. A QUERY statement is satisfied on completion of its
execution if and only if it is a blocking QUERY statement or it set
the variable specified by its READY= specifier to true. Let Q_{M<-T}
denote the number of times image M has completed the execution of a
satisfied QUERY statement with a different image T in its image set.

Execution of an image M, of the segment following a blocking QUERY
statement is delayed until, for each different T in the image set,
N_{T->M} > Q_{M<-T}. Before execution of that segment commences,
Q_{M<-T} is increased by 1.

Execution on image M of a non-blocking QUERY statement causes the
<scalar-logical-variable> to become defined. The value is set to
false if, for a different image T in the image set, N_{T->M} <=
Q_{M<-T}. Otherwise, the value is set to true, and then Q_{M<-T}
is increased by 1.
