Subject: atomic subroutine semantics and example for Annex

Discussion:
~~~~~~~~~~~

Starting from my comments on section A.3.2.2 in N1999, this paper
proposes a rewording of the text that defines the atomic subroutine
semantics as well as addition of another example to A.3.2.2.

The text in N2007/[34:4-7] does not appear in section 7.2; conversely,
the changes made in 7.2 are not completely applied in section 8.8.
Fixes for both these issues are included.

EDITS to N2007:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[17:12-15] Replace "The effect ... any other." by
"For any two executions of atomic subroutines in unordered segments by
 different images on the same atomic object, the effect is as if one of
 the executions is performed before the other in one segment on a
 single image, without access to the object in either execution
 interleaving with access to the object in the other. Which is executed
 first is indeterminate."

[[Reword in terms of the simplest building block that provides full
 generality, based on a suggestion by John Reid. Assure that the
 implementation is obliged to make the effect of all atomic updates
 visible on all images, independent of the presence of image control
 statements. "processor-dependent" appears misleading since the
 ordering may change between subsequent program runs as well as
 appear to be different on different images.]]

[17:16+] After "2010.", insert

"If two variables on image P are updated by a sequence of atomic
 memory operations, and the changes to them are observed by
 atomic accesses from an unordered segment on image Q, the changes
 need not be observed on image Q in the same order as they are made on
 image P, even if the updates on image P are made in ordered segments."

[[This is a reworded version of the text from [34:4-7] essentially
  suggested by Bill Long, including a replacement of "sequence or
  atomic" by "sequence of atomic" - presumably a typo.
  Also, I've moved the text to an earlier location since this seems
  topically appropriate; in fact it may be desirable to turn [17:16-19]
  "For invocation ... atomic action." into a separate para.]]

[17:19+] Add
  "NOTE 7.1-
   These properties support the use of atomic subroutines for designing
   customized synchronization mechanisms. The programmer needs to
   account for all possible orderings of sequences of atomic
   subroutine executions that may arise as a consequence of the above
   rules; the orderings may appear to be different on different
   images for the same program run."

[[The above is intended to replace NOTE 13.1 of 10-007]]

[34:1-7] Replace para by

{In 13.1 Classes of intrinsic procedures, replace paragraph 3 by
  paragraph 1 [[maybe 1 and 2, see above]] of 7.2 Atomic subroutines,
  with these changes: Delete "of ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010"}

{In 13.1 Classes of intrinsic procedures, replace the text
 of NOTE 13.1 with that of NOTE 7.1- in 7.2 Atomic subroutines.}

[47:26+]
"Example 4:

Assuming the declarations

INTEGER(ATOMIC_INT_KIND) :: x[*]= 0, z = 0

the statements

CALL ATOMIC_ADD(x[1], 1)         ! (A)
IF (THIS_IMAGE() == 2) THEN
  wait : DO
     CALL ATOMIC_REF(z, x[1])    ! (B)
     IF (z == NUM_IMAGES()) EXIT wait
  END DO : wait                  ! (C)
END IF

will execute the "wait" loop on image 2 until all images have completed
statement (A). The updates of x[1] are performed by each image in
the same manner, but arbitrary order. Because the result from the
complete set of updates will eventually become visible by execution
of statement (B) for some loop iteration on image 2, the termination
condition is guaranteed to be eventually fulfilled, provided that no
image failure occurs, no image branches around the above code, and no
other code is executed in an unordered segment that performs updates
to x[1]. Furthermore, if two SYNC MEMORY statements are inserted in
the above code before statement (A) and after statement (C),
respectively, the segment started by the second SYNC MEMORY on image 2
is ordered after the segments on all images that end with the first
SYNC MEMORY."
