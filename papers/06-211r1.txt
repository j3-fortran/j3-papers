Subject: Comments on the index 


This is Section 4 of 05-207, with line numbers at line 12 revised to
refer to 06-007.  Some index items are bold and some are not. Ones
generated by \tdef are generated bold automatically, while those
generated by \mindex have to be made bold explicitly. Some consistency
in the reason for bold index items ought to be adopted, unless the
existing rule is judged to be adequate. \tdef sets text in "term
definition" font and puts it in the index in "term definition" font,
while \tdeff sets text in "term definition" font without putting it in
the index, so if one wants an index term differerent from the item
that appears in "term definition" font, say the singular instead of
the plural, "tdeff should be used, followed by \mindex. If the item
should appear in bold face in the index, that needs to be done
explicitly using the \mindexd macro (\mindexd* sets the text in
ordinary font and the index in "term definition" font).

Formatting issue - Page 657 is only one column and runs past the
bottom of the page.

"abstract interface block", and "abstract type"

Changes withdraw from the original 06-211


Should we search for index terms, and add occurrences of them that are
not indexed to the index?  Index 12.0 [297:7,11] and 12.4.1 [311:1]

array" in addition to "array!assumed-shape", "array!assumed-size"
and "array!automatic"?  
[WITHDRAWN]

If we do need both "array!automatic" and "automatic array", make
"automatic array" and "automatic data object" both subsidiary to
"automatic".  
[WITHDRAWN]

Make "explicit formatting", "explicit initialization" and "explicit
interface" subsidiary to "explicit".
[WITHDRAWN]

Make "external file", "external linkage", "external procedure",
"external procedure", "external subprogram" and "external unit"

[WITHDRAWN]

Remove "conversion!numeric" since "numeric!conversion" is
