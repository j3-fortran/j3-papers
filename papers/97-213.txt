Fortran 90 interface for OpenGL, f90gl, was announced last October by William 
Mitchell (see also Fortran Forum, April 1997, page 29). The OpenGL 
Architecture Review Board (ARB) is now considering adopting the Fortran 90 
bindings on which f90gl is based as the official Fortran 90 bindings for 
OpenGL. Toward this end, they are seeking comments from people with an 
expertise in Fortran 90. The proposed bindings are defined in the NIST 
technical report "A Fortran 90 Interface for OpenGL", which can be obtained 
from the f90gl home page <http://math.nist.gov/f90gl>. Supportive comments as 
will as critical suggestions are sought.

The proposed bindings allow the user to write standard conforming portable 
Fortan programs with the full functionality of OpenGL. The interface is 
accessed through modules; this provides explicit interfaces to the OpenGL 
procedures for improved robustness.

Kind type parameters are provided for matching Fortran types to C types. This 
eliminates the need for nonstandard "*byte" declarations. It also provides a 
mechanism for transparent type conversion on systems in which the Fortran 
processor does not support all the C types used by OpenGL, for increased 
portability.

Fortran derived types are provided where C structs are used in the interface. 
This increases the similarity between the Fortran and C interfaces, and 
provides a mechanism through which the implementor can encapsulate whatever 
interface data is required.

The Fortran functions corresponding to C functions that return a pointer to a 
character string now return a pointer to an array of characters. This 
increases the similarity between the Fortran and C interfaces, and adds the 
capability of arbitrary length character string return values.

Extremely long names are truncated to 31 characters to comply with the Fortran 
90 standard, and the prefix is changed to f90gl to avoid name space clashes.
