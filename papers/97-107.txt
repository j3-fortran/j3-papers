            HPF Language Specification 2.0.delta (1996-10-19)


I have now finished my first reading of the POSIX.1 standard, which
specifies the System Application Programming Interface (API) of POSIX
for the C language. As the request for subdivision for the Technical
Report on Interoperability with C, N1131, expresses WG5's intent to
be able to interface to system routines using this TR, I felt a review
of that standard in the light of the current interoperability approach 
would be useful. This revealed a number of outstanding problems, some 
of them of a very fundamental nature. They are summarized below.

1. Arguments passed by address (C pointers), and null pointers

Up to now, WG5 has taken the approach (or at least thought of it) to do
argument passing for scalar dummy arguments inside an BIND(C) interface 
**by value**, and define a BYVAL/BYREF attribute for dummy arguments to
be able to switch to passing **by reference**. The HPF-2 attribute 
PASSBY("VAL") or PASSBY("*") does exactly this inside an EXTRINSIC(C) 
interface, this functionality might be take over by the WG5 TR. 
The semantics are that for a C function

  extern void c_func ( int *i );

and a Fortran interface (different function/argument names for clarity)

  INTERFACE
    BIND(C, NAME="c_func") SUBROUTINE f_func ( j )
      USE ISO_C ; INTEGER(c_int), PASSBY("*") :: j
    END SUBROUTINE f_func
  END INTERFACE

a Fortran call like CALL F_FUNC(K) will cause the compiler (not the 
user) to get the address of the Fortran actual argument K, and pass 
that address to #c_func#. This avoids to put C pointers in the Fortran 
user's hands. It works fine as long as #c_func# only expects #i# to 
point to a location which holds an #int# value (and only modifies the 
value of #*i#, not #i# itself). BUT:

 * It may well happen that #c_func# also modifies the value of #i# 
   itself, because in C there are two possible uses of such a function:

     int f;                  int *g;
     (void) c_func(&f);      (void) c_func(g);    /* these are CALLs */

   The call using the address #&f# of #f# is what the PASSBY("*") with
   automatic address-of-actual-arg semantics supports, but not the call
   with #g#. C functions dealing with the more general call with a 
   pointer #g# may modify the dummy #i# itself, e.g. store any address 
   in #i# instead of just modifying its target. This will break the 
   Fortran program (at best). 

 * It may also happen that the function has a different (but documented
   and important-to-have) behavior when it is passed a null pointer 
   (like C's NULL) instead of the address of an #int# variable. 
   This cannot be supported by the PASSBY("*") mechanism combined with
   automatic address-of-actual-arg semantics, because the compiler 
   **always** passes the address of a Fortran actual argument -- which 
   is different from C's NULL.

A number of POSIX.1 functions make use of this special case of passing
a null pointer as actual argument. Examples include:

 * The #argv# and #envp# arguments to the <exit> family of functions.
 * The #const struct utimbuf *times# argument of #utime#.
 * The #struct sigaction *# arguments to #sigaction()#.
 * #ctermid# may also have a NULL argument

So the handling of dummy arguments of C pointer types should be 
reconsidered. If a PASSBY("*") approach with automatic 
address-of-actual-arg by the compiler is taken, many C functions will 
not be callable from within Fortran (or at least strange results may 
occur if they are called).

        ********************************************************
        ***  This is a very fundamental design problem,      ***
        ***  which should be addressed as soon as possible!  ***
        ********************************************************

2. Function result values which are C pointers

A significant portions of the POSIX.1 functions returns a C pointer.
Examples of such functions and their return types are:

  * The #getlogin#, #getenv#, #ctermid#, #getcwd# and #setlocale# 
    functions have a return type of #char *#.
  * #readdir# has return type #struct dirent *#, and #opendir# has 
    return type #DIR *#, where #DIR# is some typedef-ed type.
  * #getgrgid# and #getgrnam# have return type #struct group *#.
  * #getpwuid# and #getpwnam# have return type #struct passwd *#.

In order to support binding to these functions, some mechanism to 
handle C pointers as result types of functions seems to be inevitable. 
At first sight, the extension of something like the HPF-2 PASSBY("*") 
spec to function result variables seems natural.  
But a very severe problem with such an approach is that some of these 
functions may return a null pointer (notably #getlogin# and #getenv#) 
under some conditions, which would (at best) break the program when 
the Fortran compiler does an automatic de-referencing of that result 
on return from the C function. This is essentially the same problem 
as in topic (1).

Even if this problem is ignored, dealing with pointer function results
would either imply copying of data from the de-referenced C result
into the Fortran variable (or temporary if the function reference is
in an expression), or require to provide C-pointer datatypes to the
Fortran programmer. 
Neither HPF-2 nor the ISO TR do currently provide such functionality.

3. Structures defined in POSIX.1

A variety of #struct# derived types is defined by POSIX.1. However, for
all of these structures only the names of the types and their required
components are specified. POSIX.1 does not define the actual order of 
these components in the #struct#, neither does it require that the 
specified components are the only components present in an actual 
implementation. In reality, there are sometimes many more components
since vendors include their own extensions in these structures.

  NOTE:
  This is another argument agains the MAP_TO approach to 
  interoperability: Since the actual contents of such a #struct# is 
  not standardized, it is not possible to specify a portable MAP_TO 
  for it in an interface block residing in application programs.

The structures defined by POSIX.1 are:

  struct dirent           struct flock        
  struct group            struct lconv        
  struct passwd           struct sigaction        
  struct stat             struct tms        
  struct utsname          struct termios        
  struct tm               struct utimbuf
  
Most of the components are intrinsic or primitive system data types 
(see topic 7), some are character arrays of implementation-dependent 
(but fixed?) size. These can all be modeled by using a BIND(C) spec 
inside a Fortran derived type definition. But some exceptions are 
important (and difficult):

* A #char*# component which does not hold the actual character data,
  but only points to its location (possibly in system memory rather
  than in user memory) is contained in #group# and #passwd#:
 
    group.gr_name
    passwd.pw_name
    passwd.pw_dir
    passwd.pw_shell

* The list of group members is attached to the #group# structure by a
  #char**# component. This points to a NULL-terminated list, again 
  possibly in system memory and possibly static.

* A function pointer is contained in #sigaction#:

    sigaction.sa_handler  void(*)()

  It is perhaps not necessary to access this component directly.
  But users must be able to declare objetcs of this structure type, 
  so at least some kind of dummy field (of suitable size) must be 
  declared instead of the function pointer when binding to such
  structures.

A derived type TYPE(C_CHAR_PTR) seems to be necessary to be able to 
bind to the #group# and #passwd# structures, as well as a means to
read the string where it points to into a Fortran CHARACTER object. 

  NOTE:
  Maybe also the reverse functionality of storing the 
  "address-of a Fortran CHARACTER object" in a C_CHAR_PTR.

Additionally, a TYPE(C_CHAR_PTR_PTR) including increment/decrement and 
de-reference operations may be useful. The former would allow to move 
through such a pointer list, the latter results in a C_CHAR_PTR which 
can then be accessed as above.

  NOTE:
  These problems are different from the problem of argument association
  (by value, by address): they occur in a structure component, and a 
  data type for these pointer components must be provided to the 
  application programmer in order to be able to bind to this API. 
  Automatic handling of the address-of and de-reference operations by 
  the compiler is not possible here. The same holds for global 
  variables (see topic 4).

Dealing with function pointers is not possible with F95 facilities 
since Fortran up to now does not support procedure variables/pointers 
to procedures. F2000 developments in this area may be incorporated 
when integrating the TR into IS 1539-1, but this is out of the scope of
the TR itself.

4. Global variables

POSIX.1 uses at least three external variables:

  extern int errno;
  extern char **environ;
  extern char *tzname[2];

Note that POSIX.1 is more restrictive than ISO C because it requires 
#errno# to be an external variable: the C standard also allows #errno#
to be a macro. It is necessary that applications can check the value of
#errno# directly, this shows the need for a means to bind to extern 
data objects, not only to extern procedures. 
Section 3.4 of N1178 (96-069) will be enhanced to support this 
requirement by a module variable approach.

If #environ# were to be accessed directly from Fortran, a corresponding
datatype would be required, as well as operations to de-reference that
pointer. This may not be critical, since the same information may be
accessed by the #getenv()# function. But that same facility is also
necessary to access some structure components, see above.

5. Underscore as the first character in identifiers

POSIX.1 defines one function, #_exit#, and a number of numerical limits
and other symbolic constants which have an underscore character as 
their first character (e.g. all symbols starting with #_POSIX#).
This is not allowed in Fortran, but is not a severe restriction since
a Fortran binding to POSIX.1 may establish naming conventions that
circumvent the leading underscore.

6. Unsigned integers

Some POSIX.1 function have unsigned integer arguments or result type,
notably the #alarm# and #sleep# functions. Some of the baud rate 
functions for terminal control have return type #speed_t#, which is 
also an unsigned integral type.
This is a minor difficulty: these types may be mapped to their 
corresponding signed types, leaving the interpretation of "negative" 
values implementation dependent.

7. Type name aliases for primitive system data types

For portability, POSIX.1 defines a number of so-called primitive system
data types. They are all #typedef#s to arithmetic types and include:

  dev_t    gid_t    ino_t    mode_t   
  nlink_t  off_t    pid_t    size_t   
  ssize_t  time_t   uid_t    

The <type-alias-stmt> of N1178 (96-069) is necessary and sufficient to 
establish corresponding derived type names for a Fortran binding. 

  NOTE:
  Working with the original intrinsic types for which these datatypes 
  are aliases would be possible, but would sacrifice source code
  portability across platforms. This is a key issue of POSIX.1.

8. Varying length argument lists

There are several POSIX.1 functions which include an <ellipsis> in
their argument list, using the features of #<stdarg.h>#. These include
the three members #execl#, #execle# and #execlp# of the <exec> family
of functions, and the #open# and #fcntl# functions.

The features specified in N1229 (96-153), improved along the lines
of X3J3's comments from meeting 139, should be sufficient to provide 
an interface to these functions.
