NUMBER: 000068
TITLE: Asterisks as I/O units
KEYWORDS: Asterisk, I/O, unit
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

Question:

1.   Does the Fortran 95 standard require the external unit
     corresponding to the I/O unit identified by an asterisk for
     input or output to be the same as the external unit identified
     by some fixed nonnegative integer value?

2.   Can the I/O unit identified by an asterisk for input or output
     correspond to more than one external unit?

3.   If the external unit identified by an integer value that
     corresponds to the I/O unit identified by an asterisk for input
     or output is closed, does that cause the I/O unit identified by
     an asterisk to become disconnected?

ANSWER:

     1.   No.

     2.   No.

     3.   No.

DISCUSSION:

The submitter states:  At least one Fortran 95 implementation uses -1
as the value of the I/O unit identified by an asterisk.  A carefully
constructed INQUIRE statement can expose this value to the user.  Many
users expect I/O to the units identified by asterisks to continue to
work even after the corresponding units identified by integer values
have been closed.

     1.   There is no requirement in the standard that the asterisk
correspond to an external-file-unit; it is, however, permissible.  An
edit is provided to clarify this.

     2.   For the units identified by the asterisk, the text of
section 9.3.2 does not allow two or more units to be connected
simultaneously to the same file [139:8-9].

     3.   The asterisk may not appear as a unit number in a CLOSE
statement.  The asterisk may not be disconnected from the associated
processor-dependent external unit.

          A processor extension may have two units connected to the
same file, e.g. unit 6 and the * output unit might both identify the
user's standard output file. This is not detectable by a standard-
conforming program; but in this case, closing unit 6 would not
necessarily affect output to the standard output file via *.
