Specification:
____________________

The proposed edits for the CONTIGUOUS attribute (see J3/05-273r2) 
introduce the concept of a contiguous array but do not complete the 
integration process with C Interop. 

In particular, three issues can be identified:

1) Array pointers and assumed-shape dummies with the CONTIGUOUS
attribute should be excluded from BIND(C) interfaces (see J3/05-281r2),
since they may have a different physical representation from
noncontiguous ones. In the future we may add additional C API for
contiguous arrays.

2) C_LOC should be extended to return the base address of (run-time) 
contiguous array pointer or assumed-shape array (edits below).

3) No edits for this, however, it should be noted. In C_F_POINTER, the
FPTR argument can be a contiguous pointer (unfortunately at this point
in time we cannot go back and require it to be such).

Edits:
____________________

[73:26+] After C530, add a new constraint:

C530a (R501) The CONTIGUOUS attribute shall not be specified for a
dummy argument of a procedure that has a <proc-language-binding-spec>.


[395:10-11] In the first list in the description of the argument to
C_LOC (15.1.2.5), replace item (b) "an allocated allocatable variable
that has the TARGET  attribute and is not an array of zero size, or"
with new item:

(b) "A contiguous object that has the TARGET attribute and is not an 
array of zero size, or"
