Subject: Executing an external program


A functionality missing from the standard is a way to execute
a program from within a Fortran program.  Many vendors
have added this feature to their compilers.

Basic Functionality: Many times, programs must cooperate
                     with other programs in order to produce
                     the desired results.  No way exists
                     within the standard to do so, yet many
                     vendors have added a "run this program"
                     intrinsic procedure to their compilers.

Rationale:  On modern operating systems, programs may be a part
            of a pipe or may require that a file be produced
            in order to continue execution.  How to do this is a FAQ
            in comp.lang.fortran and probably other forums as well.

            Sometimes, asynchronous execution is desired (for example,
            starting a program to read from a pipe), and sometimes
            synchronous execution is desired (for example, to produce
            a file for input).  So the proposal should provide
            for both possibilities.  However, executing external
            programs is processor-dependent, so the processor may
            return an error status if it can't fulfill a request.

Estimated Impact: Many vendors have an intrinsic procedure to execute
                  external programs already, standardizing the spelling
                  and functionality will have a cost, but probably
                  not too great as the proposal intends to allow processors
                  to opt-out of any capability not supported.

Detailed Specification: Add an EXECUTE_PROGRAM intrinsic procedure
                        to the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module.

                        EXECUTE_PROGRAM( CMD=<s-d-c-e>,
                                         [ ASYNCHRONOUS=['YES'|'NO'], ]
                                         [ ID=<s-i-v>, ]
                                         [ CMDSTAT=<s-i-v>, ]
                                         [ CMDMSG=<s-d-c-v> ] )

                        CMD= gives the command line to be executed.

                        ASYNCHRONOUS= tells whether synchronous
                        or asynchronous execution is requested.
                        If absent, a value of 'NO' is assumed.

                        The ID= gives a variable so the program may await
                        the result of the external program via a WAIT
                        statement.  It is valid only if ASYNCHRONOUS=
                        is present with the value 'YES'.

                        The CMDSTAT= variable is zero to indicate
                        successful completion or successful starting
                        of the command line given.  It is set
                        to a processor dependent positive value
                        if an error occurs.

                        The CMDMSG= is the vendor's cheerful message
                        detailing why the request failed.

                        Example:

                        CALL EXECUTE_PROGRAM( 'ls > list.out', CMDSTAT=mystat)
                        GOT_LIST: IF( mystat == 0 )then
                           OPEN( myunit, 'list.out')
                        ELSE GOT_LIST
                           WRITE( ERROR_UNIT, FMT= *) 'rant'
                        ENDIF GOT_LIST
