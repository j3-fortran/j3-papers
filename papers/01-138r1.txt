TITLE: What do ``Prior Specification'' and ``defined previously'' mean?
KEYWORDS: initialization, prior specification, defined previously
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION 1

What is a ``prior specification?''

The last normative paragraph of section 7.1.6.1 of the Fortran 95
standard, immediately before note 7.14 [94:38-41 in 97-007r2] states:

``If an initialization expression includes a reference to an inquiry
function for a type parameter or an array bound of an object specified in
the same <specification-part>, the type parameter or array bound shall be
specified in a prior specification of the <specification-part>.  The
prior specification may be to the left of the inquiry function in the
same statement.''

The first two sentences of the last normative paragraph of section
7.1.6.2 of the Fortran 95 standard, immediately before note 7.16
[96:32-35 in 97-007r2] are similar, but refer to specification
expressions.

Unfortunately, there is no definition of ``prior specification.''
Consider:

1.  INTEGER :: P(complicated_expression_for_lower_bound_1:   &
               & complicated_expression_for_upper_bound_1,   &
               & complicated_expression_for_lower_bound_2:   &
               & complicated_expression_for_upper_bound_2) = &
               & RESHAPE( (/ 11, 21, 12, 22 /), SHAPE(P) )

(Notice the reference to P in the <initialization>.)

Some processors reason ``the `specification' of P is only the
specification of its name, kind, rank and array bounds, and therefore
is `prior' by the time the <initialization> is encountered,'' and
accept this.

Others reason ``the `specification' of P is the syntax term
<entity-decl> defined by syntax rule R504 on page 47, which includes
the <initialization>, and it is therefore not `prior' until the
<initialization> is completely specified,'' and do not accept this.

                                                            J3/01-138r1
										Page 2 of 3

By way of further examples, which of the following are standard
conforming?

2.  INTEGER(selected_int_kind(4)) :: A(KIND(A))
3.  INTEGER :: A(2,2*SIZE(A,1)+1)
4.  CHARACTER :: C(10)*(SIZE(C,1))
5.  INTEGER :: P(10) = LBOUND(P,1)

The paragraphs cited above are silent concerning inquiry functions that
are not for type parameters or array bounds.  These include BIT_SIZE,
DIGITS, EPSILON, MAXEXPONENT, MINEXPONENT, PRECISION, RADIX, RANGE and
TINY.  The results of all of these are derived, however, from the types
and kind type parameters of their arguments.

Are the objects about which these functions inquire required to be
specified in a prior specification of the <specification-part>, and is
that specification allowed to be in the same statement so long as it is
to the left of the inquiry function of which it is an argument?

Which of the following are standard conforming?

6:  INTEGER :: B = BIT_SIZE(B)
7.  INTEGER :: B(BIT_SIZE(B))
8.  INTEGER :: D = DIGITS(D)
9.  INTEGER :: D(DIGITS(D))
10. REAL :: X = EPSILON(X)

One could construct obvious similar examples for the remainder of inquiry
functions that do not inquire about type parameters or array bounds.

QUESTION 2

The second normative paragraph in subclause 5.1.2.1 [52:27-28 in
97-007r2] states "Any named constant that appears in the initialization
expression shall have been defined previously in the same type
declaration statement...."  The third normative paragraph after syntax
rule R531 in subclause 5.2.9 [61:4-7 in 97-007r2] is similar.

Does "defined previously" mean that all of the properties of the named
constant shall have been defined previously, or that a referenced
property of it shall have been defined previously?  E.g. if the KIND is
needed, is it necessary for the value to have been defined?

                                                            J3/01-138r1

ANSWER 1

    A prior specification refers to a specification in a previous
   <entity-decl> or in a previous statement.  None of the examples are legal.


ANSWER 2
   
    In the referenced text (5.1.2.1), "Any named constant that appears ...
    shall have been defined previously" mean that all of the
    properties of the named constant shall have been defined previously;
    therefore, if the KIND of a named constant is needed, is it necessary 
    for the value of that named constant to have been defined previously also.
