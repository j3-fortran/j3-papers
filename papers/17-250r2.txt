Subject: C915 missing TEAM_TYPE
Date: 2017 October 19

1. Discussion

We prohibit type C_PTR or C_FUNPTR from the intrinsic module
ISO_C_BINDING in multiple scenarios as they cannot be coarray.
Since we disallow TEAM_TYPE being coarray in C823, we should
add TEAM_TYPE.

2. Edits


[xx] In Introduction, in the last bullet section of paragraph 2:
"Changes to features previously described by ISO/IEC TS 18508:2015",
at the end of the section, add a sentence:

"A variable of type TEAM_TYPE may have a pointer component, and the
effective uses of team variables are limited to the image where their
values were computed."


[75:2] 7.5.4.1 Component definition statement, in C748

after "ISO_C_BINDING" change "(18.3.3)" to "(18.2)" and add ", or of
type TEAM_TYPE from the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV (16.10.2)".

{C748 now reads:
C748 (R737) If a coarray-spec appears, the component shall not be of
type C_PTR or C_FUNPTR from the intrinsic module ISO_C_BINDING (18.2),
or of type TEAM_TYPE from the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
(16.10.2).}


[133:11] 9.4.2 Structure components, in C915

after "(18.2)" add ", or of type TEAM_TYPE from the intrinsic module
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV (16.10.2)".

{C915 now reads:
C915 A data-ref shall not be of type C_PTR or C_FUNPTR from the
intrinsic module ISO_C_BINDING (18.2), or of type TEAM_TYPE from the
intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV (16.10.2) if one of its part-refs has
an image-selector.}


[141:12-13] 9.7.1.1 Form of the ALLOCATE statement C937

Change "specify the type C_PTR" to "specify type C_PTR", and

after "ISO_C_BINDING" add ", or type TEAM_TYPE from the intrinsic
module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV".

{C937 now reads:
C937 (R927) If an allocate-object is a coarray, type-spec shall not
specify type C_PTR or C_FUNPTR from the intrinsic module
ISO_C_BINDING, or type TEAM_TYPE from the intrinsic module
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.}


[141:28] 9.7.1.1 Form of the ALLOCATE statement C946

after "ISO_C_BINDING" add ", or TEAM_TYPE from the
intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV".

{C946 now reads:
C946 (R927) The declared type of source-expr shall not
be C_PTR or C_FUNPTR from the intrinsic module
ISO_C_BINDING, or TEAM_TYPE from the intrinsic module
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV if an allocate-object is a coarray.}


[142:9-10] 9.7.1.1 Form of the ALLOCATE statement

change "EVENT_TYPE or LOCK_TYPE" to "EVENT_TYPE, LOCK_TYPE, or
TEAM_TYPE" twice.

{It now reads:
If an ALLOCATE statement has a SOURCE= specifier and an
allocate-object that is a coarray, source-expr shall not have a
dynamic type of C_PTR or C_FUNPTR from the intrinsic module
ISO_C_BINDING, or EVENT_TYPE, LOCK_TYPE, or TEAM_TYPE from
the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV, or have a subcomponent whose
dynamic type is EVENT_TYPE, LOCK_TYPE, or TEAM_TYPE.}


[172:12] 10.2.1.3 Interpretation of intrinsic assignments, paragraph
12

after "ISO_C_BINDING" add ", or of the type TEAM_TYPE from the
intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV".

{It now reads:
For an intrinsic assignment of the type C_PTR or C_FUNPTR
from the intrinsic module ISO_C_BINDING, or of the type
TEAM_TYPE from the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV, the variable
becomes undefined if the variable and expr are not on the same
image.}


[172: NOTE 10.41] 10.2.1.3 Interpretation of intrinsic assignments

change "C_PTR or C_FUNPTR" to "C_PTR, C_FUNPTR or TEAM_TYPE"

{NOTE 10.41 now reads:
An intrinsic assignment statement for a variable of
type C_PTR, C_FUNPTR or TEAM_TYPE is not permitted to involve a
coindexed object, see C915, which prevents inappropriate copying
from one image to another. However, such copying can occur as an
intrinsic assignment for a component in a derived-type assignment.}


[215:12-] At the end of 11.6.9 FORM TEAM statement, following the last
Note (11.45), add a new Note:

"Note 11.45+

The values of the team variables on the images of the team might
differ between images. Usage of the value of a team variable should be
limited to its own image."


[445:34] In 16.10.2.32 TEAM_TYPE, in the first paragraph, delete

";no component is a pointer"

{There is no longer a useful restriction.}

[532:9] 19.6.6 Events that cause variables to become undefined, list
item (25)

after "ISO_C_BINDING" add ", or of the type TEAM_TYPE
from the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV,".

{It now reads:
(25) Execution of an intrinsic assignment of the type C_PTR, C_FUNPTR
from the intrinsic module ISO_C_BINDING, or of the type TEAM_TYPE from
the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV, in which the variable and expr
are not on the same image causes the variable to become undefined.}
