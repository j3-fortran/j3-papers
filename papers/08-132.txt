Discussion:

The WG5 direction of 12-feb-2008 is to add a CODIMENSION attribute as
a means of specifiying codimensions for a coarray. A corresponding
CODIMENSION statement is required.


Edits to 08-007:

Clause 2:

[28:24+] In the list of <specification-stmt> add

                 "<<or>> <codimension-stmt>"

Clause 4:

[69:16+] In 4.5.4.1 Component definition statement, after "or
ALLOCATABLE" add a new <component-attr-spec>:
 
    "<<or>> CODIMENSION <lbracket> <coarray-spec> <rbracket>"

[69:18-19] Delete the second DIMENSION <component-attr-spec> "or
DIMENSION [ ..."  .

[72:1-] Move [71:11-13], paragraph 2 of 4.5.4.2 Array components, to
after Note 4.30 and make it a new subclause

"4.5.4.2a Coarray components" 

and replace "DIMENSION" with "CODIMENSION" twice in the moved text.


Clause 5:

[93:21+] In 5.2.1 Syntax of 5.2 Type declaration statements, in the
  list for <attr-spec>, insert a new attribute "<codimension-spec>".

[94:3-4] In 5.2.1 Syntax of 5.2 Type declaration statements, at the
end of the first sentence of paragraph 2, add "and the CODIMENSION
attribute may be specified or overridden for an entity by the
apperance of <coarray-spec> in its <entity-decl>"

[97:20+] After 5.3.5 BIND attribute for data entries, insert a new
subclause:

"5.3.5a CODIMENSION attribute

5.3.5a.1 General

  The CODIMENSION attribute specifies that an entity is a coarray. The
  <coarray-spec> specifies its corank or corank and cobounds.

R5xxa <codimension-spec> <<is>> CODIMENSION <lbracket> <coarray-spec>
<rbracket>

  C5xx (R5xxa) A coarray with the ALLOCATABLE attribute shall be
              specified with a <coarray-spec> that is a
              <deferred-coshape-spec-list>."

{Text insert: Move the text at [99:4 - 99:10-] (C525 through Note 5.9)
to this point.}

Add:

"R5xxb <coarray-spec> <<is>> <deferred-shape-spec-list>
                     <<or>> <explicit-shape-spec-list>"

{Text insert: Move the text at [102:10-103:6] (5.3.7.7 Allocatable
coarray through the end of 5.3.7.8 Explicit-coshape coarray) to this
point.}


[98:25-28] In 5.7.3.1 General of 5.3.7 DIMENSION attribute, in the
first paragraph, delete ",a co-array, or both", and delete the last
two sentences "If an <array-spec> ... it is a co-array".  At the
beginning of paragraph 2 replace "For an array, its" with "Its".
Delete the second sentence, "For a co-array..." of paragraph
2. Finally, combine the remaining text into one paragraph.

[99:1] Delete "<<or>> DIMENSION [ ... <rbracket>"

[110:10+] insert a subclause before 5.4.5 CONTIGUOUS statement

"5.4.4a CODIMENSION statement

Rxxc <codimension-stmt> <<is>> CODIMENSION [ :: ]
<codimension-decl-list>

Rxxd <codimension-decl> <<is>> <coarray-name> <lbracket> <coarray-spec>
<rbracket>

The CODIMENSION statement specifies the CODIMENSION attribute (5.3.x)
for a list of objects.

Note 5.xx
  An example of a CODIMENSION statement is:

  CODIMENSION a[*], b[3,*], c[:]
End Note"


[113:4] In 5.4.7 DIMENSION statement delete "<<or>> <co-name>
... <rbracket>".
