Subject:   F2023 interp: Fixed form statement length

NUMBER: F23/020
TITLE: Fixed form statement length
KEYWORDS:  fixed-form, continuation
DEFECT TYPE: Defect
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Fortran 2023 6.3.2.6p2 says, "A statement shall not have more than one million
characters." This restriction, however, is in a section labeled "Free form
statements", and 6.3.1p3 says, "The rules in 6.3.2 apply only to free form
source"; there is no longer any similar restriction in 6.3.3 Fixed source
form as there was in Fortran 2018 (a limit of 255 continuation lines.)

Was it intended to remove all restrictions on continuations and statement
length for fixed form source?

ANSWER:

No, the new limit on overall statement length was intended to apply also
to fixed source form. Edits are provided to correct the error.

EDITS to 24-007:

[57:6+] 6.3.1p2+ Source form, Program units, statements and lines

After p2, insert a new paragraph:

A statement shall not have more than one million characters.

[58:30] 6.3.2.6p2 Free form statements

Delete the paragraph reading, "A statement shall not have more than one million
characters."
