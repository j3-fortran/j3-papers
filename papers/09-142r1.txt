Discussion:

The wording in 09-007 describing variables of type LOCK_TYPE (lock
variables) lack precision an clarity.

Background:

The intent is that a lock variable may have two "states", locked and
unlocked. One value corresponds to the unlocked state, and is the same
value as the structure constructor LOCK_TYPE().  Many values may
represent the locked state, with the value depending on which image
currently holds the lock. While there is no specified definition of
the type, it is helpful to consider the simplest, most obvious
possibility:

type lock_type
   integer(atomic_int_kind),private :: owner = 0
end lock_type

The unlocked state corresponds to the owner component having the value
0. The locked state corresponds to the owner component value equal to
the image number of the image that executed a LOCK statement to change
the owner value from 0. With this model, execution of a simple LOCK
statement becomes an atomic operation of {If owner == 0, set owner =
this_image()}. Execution of a simple UNLOCK statement becomes an
atomic operation of {If owner == this_image(), set owner = 0}.

UTI 155:

The wording needs to be fixed to distinguish between the "value" of a
lock variable (of which there are many possibilities) and the "state"
of a lock variable (of which there are two possibilities). Edit is
provided.

It is not possible for a lock variable to be undefined. It is
initially defined because all the components have default
initialization, and the values change only by execution of LOCK or
UNLOCK statements, both of which leave the lock variable defined.

UTI 156:

Constraint C608 can be split into two sentences to avoid confusion.

UTI 157:

It is reasonable to make the restriction that lock variables should
not be changed by means other than LOCK and UNLOCK statements into a
constraint. Edit supplied.

UTI 158:

A replacement Note is provided below to address the issues raised in
UTI 158.

------------

Edits to 09-007:

-------
[118:2] In 6.2.2 Lock variables, para1, sentence 2,

replace "values" with "states",

and add two new sentences after sentence 2

"The unlocked state is represented by the value LOCK_TYPE(). All other
values represent the locked state."

---------
[118:5-6] In 6.2.2 Lock variables, replace constraint C608 with:

"C608 A variable of type LOCK_TYPE shall be a coarray. A variable with
a LOCK_TYPE subcomponent shall be a coarray."

---------
[118:7-8] In 6.2.2 Lock variables, convert para 2 into constraint
C608a.

--------------
[119:Note 6.2] Replace the contents of Note 6.2 at the end of 6.2.2
Lock variables with:

"The restrictions against changing a lock variable except via the LOCK
and UNLOCK statements ensure the integrity of its value and facilitate
efficient implementation, particularly when special synchronization is
needed for correct lock operation."
