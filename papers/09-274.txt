1.  Discussion

The edits proposed here are revisions of those in 09-186r3,
following comments by Malcolm Cohen in 09-239.


2.  Edits


[128:12-13] In 6.7.1.2 Execution of an ALLOCATE statement, para 3,
replace "each" by "every" twice.


[187:19] In 8.5.1 Image control statements, para 1, delete "as".


[187:20] In 8.5.1 Image control statements, para 2, replace the
first sentence of p2 with
  "Execution of an image control statement divides the execution
  sequence on an image into segments."
An alternative edit would be to delete this sentence altogether. It
seems like a restatement of the definition of a segment, which is
at [188:8-9] in the section titled "Segments".

[191:2-3] In 8.5.5 SYNC MEMORY statement, para 1, replace
"The SYNC MEMORY ... each of which" by
"Execution of a SYNC MEMORY statement ends one segment and begins
another; these two segments".


[192] In 8.5.5 SYNC MEMORY statement, NOTE 8.39:

In the 8th line of the example program segment, replace
"! Preceding segment" with  "! Segment <P_i>"

In the 10th line, replace
"segment <P_i>" with  "segment <P_{i+1}>"

In the 14th line, replace
"segment <Q_j>" with  "segment <Q_{j-1}>"

In the 18th line, replace
"Subsequent segment" with  "Segment <Q_j>".

Replace the first para after the program text with:
"The DO WHILE loop does not complete until VAL is defined with the
value false. This is the cooperative synchronization that provides the
dependency that image Q does not complete the segment <Q_{j-1}> until
the CALL statement in segment <P_{i+1}> completes.  This ensures that
the execution of segment <P_i> on image P precedes execution of
segment <Q_j> on image Q."

In the third paragraph, delete the first sentence, "The definition
... of segment <P_i>."

At the end of the third paragraph, replace "<Q_j>" with "<Q_{j-1}>".

[It is clearer to have the description in 8.5.5p3 use the same segment
labels as the example in Note 8.39.]
