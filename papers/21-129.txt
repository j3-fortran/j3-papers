1. Introduction

The terms data pointer and procedure pointer are not always hyperlinked
to the definitions. For example, the usages in the POINTER attribute
subclause. It would be easier for the electronic reader to find them if
they were more widely hyperlinked.

2. Edits to 21-007

No textual edits.

Hyperlink "procedure pointer" to its definition throughout.

Hyperlink "data pointer" to its definition throughout.
