This paper has been substantially modified by /interop.
Subgroup's comments are enclosed in {}. Modified edits
have *ALTERED* before them.

28:2+. Add 'END ENUM' to the list.

*ALTERED*
43:20-21. Change
    'a C struct type with which an entity of the derived type is
  interoperable (15.2.3)'
to
  'a C struct type with which the derived type is
  interoperable (15.2.3)'.
[Section 4 is about types and 15.2.3 is about interoperability of
types.]
{ There may be more than one C struct type with which the derived
  type is interoperable }

64:23. Replace 'for an enumerator in an ENUMERATOR statement'
	with
	'appears in <<enumerator>>'

64:29-65:1. Change
   'an entity of type integer with that kind is interoperable (15.2)
   with an entity of the corresponding C enumeration type'
to
   'an integer type with that kind is interoperable (15.2.1) with
   the corresponding C enumeration type'.

71:32. Change 'subprogram or interface body' to 'procedure'.
  [We need to allow for ENTRY. There is no need to mention 'interface
  body' explicitly. This is simply one mechanism for giving the
  attribute to a procedure. For example, 12.4.1 makes no mention of
  interface blocks, but a procedure written in another language may
  use keyword arguments as long as it has an interface block. ]

*ALTERED*
77:11. Delete (15.2.7) after '.'
{ Subgroup believes that the standard already makes it clear that
there need not be any interoperable entity }

*ALTERED*
87:6-11 No edits required.
{ 02/188 comments are wrong. BIND statement is available for
procedures and derived types. }

277:15. Change 'whose interface' to 'that'.
[The BIND attribute is a characteristic of a procedure, see 12.2.
It may, of course, be specified by an interface block.]

*ALTERED*
282:22-23. No edits required.
{ There is no requirement that there be such a C function. Already
  specified. }

*ALTERED*
381:14-16 Change ', C_NULL_CHAR, ... C_NULL_PTR.' to
'and the first column of Table 15.2, the procedures specified in
15.1.2, and C_PTR and C_NULL_PTR.'

383:1. Change 'target' to 'TARGET'.

*ALTERED*
383:2. No edits needed. { 'has' is just fine }

383:8. Change 'object' to 'entity'.

384:7-9. Delete the J3 internal note and replace lines 7-9 by

  The following subclauses define the conditions under which a Fortran
  entity is interoperable. If a Fortran entity is interoperable, an
  equivalent entity may be defined by means of C and the Fortran entity
  is said to be interoperable with the C entity.  There does not have to
  be such an interoperating C entity.

*ALTERED*
384:20+. Add paragraph:

  A combination of intrinsic type and type parameters is <<interoperable>>
  if it is interoperable with a C type.
{Subgroup found the grammar of the original edit to be difficult.
 This seems to be slightly better. }

*ALTERED*
386:4. Change to

  15.2.3  Interoperability of derived types and C struct types

{ Kept the title change, did not see the need for the other edits }


*ALTERED*
387:1-4. Change to

  15.2.4 Interoperability of scalar variables

  A scalar Fortran variable is <<interoperable>> if its type and type
  parameters are interoperable and it has neither
  the pointer nor the allocatable attribute.

  An interoperable scalar Fortran variable is interoperable with a
  scalar C entity if their types and type parameters are interoperable.
{ Deleted "it is not polymorphic, ", that is implied by the remaining
text, and changed "types" to "type" }

*ALTERED*
387:5. Change to

  15.2.5 Interoperability of array variables

  An array Fortran variable is <<interoperable>> if its type and type
  parameters are interoperable and it is of
  explicit shape or assumed size.
{Same as above}

*ALTERED*
388:1. Change to

   15.2.6 Interoperability of procedures and procedure interfaces
{ Kept the title change. The rest of the edits are not needed. Paper
198r1 fixes unresolved issue #347 }

389:7. Delete 'procedure'.

389:9+. In NOTE 15.20, add
     INTERFACE
     END INTERFACE
  around the Fortran code.

390:0. Interchange the two USE statements in NOTE 15.21.

*ALTERED*
390:7. No edits needed {with all of the above we need this}

*ALTERED*
391:13-392:1 Replace by
'The procedure may be defined by means other than Fortran, or
may be defined by means of a Fortran subprogram that has a
<<proc-language-binding-spec>> in its <<function-stmt>>,
<<subroutine-stmt>>, or <<entry-stmt>>.

{ Subgroup intends that different ENTRYs may have different
BINDs. The rest is just cleanup. }

392:0 Delete J3 note for unresolved issue 358.

392:23+, NOTE 15.23. After the SUBROUTINE statement, add
          ...
and after the present USE statement, add
          ...
[The dots indicate that these procedures do something.]

395:18. After 'external procedures,' add 'procedure binding labels,'.

*ALTERED*

412:46-49. No edits required.
{Subgroup believes that association is well-defined for variables
of type C_PTR and that no new form of association is introduced}.

421:7+. Add <<interoperable>> (15.2). The property of a Fortran entity
that ensures that an equivalent entity may be defined by means of a
companion processor.
