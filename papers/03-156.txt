Here are some minor edits that I would like to suggest

216:14. Change 'a' to 'the' [cf line 12].

235:2. Before 'The' add 'If the mode is COMMA during list-directed
input/output, the character used as a value separator is a semicolon
in place of a comma.'.
[10.7.8 is the main reference for the decimal edit mode, see 9.4.1,
9.4.5.5, 9.5.1.6, 10.10.1.2 and should be complete. I missed this
property when constructing my summary.]
