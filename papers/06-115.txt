Title: Allow forward type for allocatable components

Submitted by: J3

Status: For Consideration

Basic Functionality: Do not require the type of an allocatable component
to be defined before the type containing the allocatable component.

Rationale: Mutually recursive types can be related by components having
the POINTER attribute, which allows the types of the components to be
defined after the type definition in which the components appear.  Some
mutually recursive types could be related by components having the
ALLOCATABLE attribute, except that is presently prohibited.  ALLOCATABLE
is preferable to POINTER whenever possible.  We should make every effort
to make ALLOCATABLE as widely usable as possible.

Estimated Impact: Easy to implement, improves performance, trivial change
in the standard.  Estimated at meeting 169 to be at 3 on the JKR scale.

Detailed Specification: Do not require the type of an allocatable
component to be defined before the type containing the allocatable
component.

Suggested Edits:  The following suggested edits illustrate the magnitude
of the proposal.

In Constraint 438 [50:18-19], replace "the POINTER attribute is not" by
"neither the POINTER nor ALLOCATABLE attribute is" and delete "shall be
CLASS(*) or" (Constraint 437 requires either the POINTER or ALLOCATABLE
attribute for a component declared with the CLASS keyword).

In Constraint 439 [50:21], insert "or ALLOCATABLE" after "POINTER".
