Discussion:

In 10-165 there are references to abstracted MPI routines.  Since
these references don't comply with the MPI standard, the names of the
routines need to be changed.  Edits are provided to make this change.

Edits to 10-165:

[15:6]
In A.1.1, replace "for an abstracted MPI routine" by "for an abstracted message
passing routine"

[15:7]
Add "to be transferred" to the end of the first sentence in paragraph 1.

[15:8]
Replace "both 4 and 8 byte integers," in the second sentence of paragraph 1
by "both 4 and 8 byte integers for the buffer size,"

[15:10]
In A.1.1, para 5, lines 10-26, replace all occurrences of "MPI_xxx" in A.1.1
by "EXAMPLE_send".

[15:11]
In A.1.1, para 4, replace "In the Fortran MPI module:" by "In the Fortran
module:"

[15:13]
Replace both pairs of two character quotes, '', by a single character
version.

[15:30]
In A.1.2, beginning at line 30 on page 15 and continuing through line 20
on page 16, replace all occurrences of "MPI_send_abstract" by "EXAMPLE_send".

[15:34]
In A.1.2, beginning at line 34 on page 15 and continuing through line 16
on page 16, replace all occurrences of "MPI_send_old" by "EXAMPLE_send_old"
and all occurrences of "MPI_send_new" by "EXAMPLE_send_new".

[15:31]
In A.1.2, replace "void * buffer_desc" at line 31 by "CFI_cdesc_t *
buffer_desc".

[15:34]
Replace both pairs of two character quotes, '', by a single character
version at line 34, page 15 and line 2, page 16.
