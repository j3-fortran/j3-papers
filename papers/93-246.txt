========= letter ballot X3J3 93-246.....cut-off date Sept 20, 1993 =========

X3J3 approval of Fortran 90 defect management items in document X3J3/93-006
as updated at the end of meeting 126.

There are 33 items in 93-006 that have the status "X3J3 draft response".
These 33 items are listed below, together with boxes to indicate your
approval (Yes or Yes-with-comments) or disapproval (No) of each item.
Any disapproved items must be accompanied by reasons, either in
the space provided or in text at the end of the ballot.
  [email note - in the list below, "Y" indicates the "Yes" column (without
                comments), "wc" next to "Y" represents the "Yes-with-
                comments" column, and "N" indicates the "No" column]

As the latest version of 93-006 has been distributed, a copy of the
interpretations being balloted is not included. The version of the
93-006 that is basis of the ballot was distributed on Aug 6th 1993.
The summary section at the top of that 93-006 incorrectly showed
the status of interpretations 12 and 114 as X instead of D. The
status field in the text of the interpretation is the correct one
(namely "X3J3 draft response").

Following this ballot, those items approved, together with those already
having the status "X3J3 approved; ready for WG5" in 93-006, will be
forwarded to WG5 for further processing as Fortran 90 defect management items.
