NUMBER: F03/0100
TITLE: Error in field width for special cases of signed INFINITY output
KEYWORDS: formatted output, signed infinity
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting


QUESTION:

Is there an error in the description for the output of a IEEE infinity
with a sign and a field width of 3 or 8?

228:36-37 describes the output for an IEEE infinity and special cases
field widths of 3 and 8.  But, the special casing doesn't consider the
possibility of a plus or minus sign in the field.  A signed infinity
should be special cased for field widths of 9 and 4.  The current text
also fails to take into account the case of <w> = 0, for both Infinity
and NaN values.


ANSWER:

Yes, there is an error in the special cases.  Edits are provided to
correctly describe the required field widths for signed infinities.
An edit is also provided to repair the description of the output of
NaN values.

EDITS:

[228:36-37] In the paragraph beginning "For an internal value that is
an IEEE infinity." in 10.6.1.2.1 "F editing" replace the final
sentence with:

'The minimum field width required for output of the form "Inf" is 3 if
no sign is produced, and 4 otherwise. If <w> is greater than zero but
less than the minumum required, the field is filled with asterisks.
The minimum field width for output of the form "Infinity" is 8 if no
sign is produced and 9 otherwise.  If <w> is less than the mimimum
required but large enough to produce the form "Inf" then the form
"Inf" is output.'


[229:2] In the last sentence of the paragraph in 10.6.1.2.1 "F
editing" covering the output of NaN values, replace "If <w> is less
than 3" with "If <w> is greater than zero and less than 3".
