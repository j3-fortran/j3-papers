Subject:   Coarray teams
Date: 2013 February 12
Reference: WG5/N1883, WG5/N1930, 12-201

1. Discussion
-------------

This paper proposes syntax and semantics for coarray teams.

2. Requirements (copied from N1930)
-----------------------------------

Teams provide a capability to restrict the image set of remote memory
references, coarray allocations, and synchronizations to a subset of
all the images of the program. This simplifies writing programs that
involve segregated activities (parts of a climate model, for example)
that might be more easily be written independently or may have already
been written as independent programs. Teams also provide a mechanism
for subdividing the computation for the sake of better performance
(such as within local SMP domains). Finally, teams provide the
capability to execute procedures (such as library procedures) that use
coarrays internally on a subset of the images of a program.

T1: When a block of code is executed on images executing as a team, it
    should execute on those images as if the program contained no
    other images. This has the following implications:

    1. Image indices shall be relative to the team, starting at 1 and
       ending with the number of images in the team.  

    2. Collective activities that would involve all images, such as
       SYNC ALL, allocation and deallocation of coarrays, collective
       subroutine execution, and inquiry intrinsics such as THIS_IMAGE
       and NUM_IMAGES shall be relative to the team.

T2: While an image executes a statement it shall be a member of one
    and only one team. Access to variables on images outside the
    current team is not permitted.

T3: It should be possible to split a team into mutually exclusive
    subsets that are themselves teams. This should be dynamic in order
    to allow different groupings of images during different stages of
    execution. It is desirable to have a compact mechanism for an
    image to specify which team it wishes to belong.

T4: There shall be a construct mechanism for changing the current
    team, involving the synchronization of all members of the teams
    at the beginning and end of the construct. The construct shall
    support separate execution blocks based on team membership. The
    construct shall make apparent (both to the system and the
    programmer) where team execution begins and ends.

T5: There shall be a type for variables identifying a team collection
    (probably an opaque derived type defined in the intrinsic module
    ISO_FORTRAN_ENV).

T6: There needs to be a mechanism to find the image index relative to
    the set of an ancestor team. This might best be done by adding an
    optional argument to IMAGE_INDEX that specifies the ancestor team.

T7: An allocatable coarray that is allocated within a team construct
    shall be deallocated before execution of the team construct
    terminates.  An coarray that was allocated in a parent team shall
    not be deallocated within an child team construct.

T8: The restriction that standard input is attached only to image 1 is
    unchanged, and the designated image is image 1 of the original set
    of images present at program startup.
    

3. Modifications to the requirements
------------------------------------

We have kept to the requirements except as follows 

T4. We do not provide explicit syntax for separate execution blocks 
based on team membership because this can easily be programmed with  
existing constructs, as is illustrated in an example. 

T6. An extension of THIS_IMAGE is the natural way to achieve this aim.

T9. We have added facilities for the support of failed images. This 
addition needs consideration by WG5. 

T10. We have added a SYNC TEAM statement for efficient synchronization
of members of a team.  This addition needs consideration by WG5.

4. Syntax and Semantics
--------------------

The derived type TEAM_TYPE is defined in the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic
module. Its components are private; no component is allocatable or a
pointer. It is an extensible type with no type parameters. 

A variable of type TEAM_TYPE is a team variable. A team variable shall
not appear in a variable definition context except as an argument to
the intrinsic subroutine FORM_SUBTEAM or as an <allocate-object> in an
ALLOCATE statement that does not have a SOURCE= specifier. It shall
not be a coarray or a subobject of a coarray.

Every image of the program begins execution as part of the initial
team. At any point during execution of the program an image shall be
part of one and only one team. That team is the current team. The
result of the NUM_IMAGES() intrinsic function is the number of images
in the current team. The image index values for images of the current
team are in the set 1..NUM_IMAGES(). No mechanism is provided to
access variables on images outside the current team.

An intrinsic collective subroutine called FORM_SUBTEAM is provided. 

The intrinsic function SUBTEAM_ID provides the value of the subteam
identifier in the call from the executing image of the subroutine
FORM_SUBTEAM that formed the current team.

The intrinsic function TEAM_DEPTH provides the depth in the tree of
teams, a positive integer, of the team this image is part of, relative
to the initial team (which has depth 0).

The current team to which the execution image belongs is changed by
execution of a CHANGE TEAM construct.

The SYNC TEAM statement provides synchronization of the members of a
team. The statement shall be executed only on images that are part of
the specified team, and all such images shall execute the statement.

A new named constant, STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, is defined in the
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module.  It shall have a nonzero value that
is different from the value of STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE, STAT_LOCKED,
STAT_LOCKED_OTHER_IMAGE, or STAT_UNLOCKED. The value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE
becomes the value of the variable in a STAT= specifier, or STAT
argument, in an image control statement if execution of the statement
involves synchronization with, or accessing a variable on an image of
the current team that has failed. A failed image is one for which
references or definitions of data fail when that data should be
accessible, or the image fails to respond as part of a collective
activity.  A failed image remains failed for the remainder of the
program execution.  What constitutes a failed image is processor
dependent, but usually is associated with a hardware failure of the
processor, memory system, or interconnection network.

The intrinsic function FAILED_IMAGES() provides the values of the
image indices for the images in the current team that have failed.

The intrinsic function THIS_IMAGE() is extended to have an optional
argument TEAM. The TEAM argument shall be a team variable for an
ancestor team of the current team. It shall not be a coarray. The
result value is the image index of the executing image in that
team. The intrinsic function THIS_IMAGE(COARRAY [, DIM]) is not
extended.

The intrinsic function NUM_IMAGES() is extended to have optional
arguments TEAM and FAILED. The TEAM argument shall be a team variable 
for an ancestor team of the current team. The result value is the 
number of images in that team. If FAILED is absent, the total number
of images is returned. If FAILED is present with the value true, the  
number of failed images is returned. If FAILED is present with the 
value false, the total number of images that have not failed is 
returned. 

Access to the standard input unit is available only on the image 
that has image index 1 in the initial team.

5. Teams of images

5.1 Introduction

A team of images is a set of images that access each other's data and
synchronize with each other. The current team is the team that
includes the executing image. All image indices are relative to the
current team and data on images outside this team are
inaccessible. Synchronization is possible only with other images of
the team.  Initially, the current team consists of all the images and
this is known as the initial team. A team is divided into subteams by
invoking the intrinsic subroutine FORM_SUBTEAM. Each subteam is
identified by an integer value known as its subteam identifier.
Information about the team to which the current image belongs is
stored in its team variable.

Execution of a CHANGE TEAM statement changes the current team to 
the subteam for the executing image as determined by the specified
team variable. Execution of an END TEAM statement changes the current
team to the parent team. CHANGE TEAM constructs may be
nested to any depth to give finer subdivisions.

5.2 TEAM_TYPE

The derived type TEAM_TYPE is an extensible type with no type
parameters. Its components are private; no component is allocatable or
a pointer. A scalar of this type describes a team that includes the
executing image. TEAM_TYPE is defined in the intrinsic module
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.

A variable of type TEAM_TYPE is a team variable. A team variable
shall not appear in a variable definition context except as an
argument to the intrinsic subroutine FORM_SUBTEAM or as an
<allocate-object> in an ALLOCATE statement that does not have a
SOURCE= specifier.


5.3 CHANGE TEAM construct

The CHANGE TEAM construct changes the current team to which the 
executing image belongs.

R501 change-team-construct is change-team-stmt
                                 block
                              end-change-team-stmt
R502 change-team-stmt      is [team-construct-name:] []
                              [] CHANGE TEAM (team-variable)
R503 end-change-team-stmt  is END TEAM [team-construct-name] 

C501 (R501) A branch within a CHANGE TEAM construct shall not have a branch
target that is outside the construct.

C502 (R501) If the change-team-stmt of a change-team-construct 
specifies a team-construct-name, the corresponding end-change-team-stmt 
shall specify the same team-construct-name. If the change-team-stmt of a
change-team-construct does not specify a team-construct-name, the 
corresponding end-change-team-stmt shall not specify a team-construct-name.

C503 (R502) The team-variable shall be a scalar of the type
            TEAM_TYPE defined in the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module
            and shall not be a coarray or a subobject of a coarray.

The value of the team-variable shall have been defined by invoking the
intrinsic subroutine FORM_SUBTEAM. The team executing the
change-team-stmt shall be the team that formed the team variable.  The
current team for the statements of the change-team block is the
subteam that was specified for the executing image by the invocation
of FORM_SUBTEAM.

An allocatable coarray that was allocated when execution of a
change-team construct began shall not be deallocated during the
execution of the construct. An allocatable coarray that is allocated
when execution of a change-team construct completes is deallocated if
it was not allocated when execution of the construct began.

Both the CHANGE TEAM and END TEAM statements are image control
statements. When a CHANGE TEAM statement is executed, there is an
implicit synchronization of all images of the current team. On each
image, execution of the segment following the statement is delayed
until all the other images have executed the same statement the same
number of times. When execution of a change-team block finishes, there
is an implicit synchronization of all images of the parent team. On
each image, execution of the segment following the END TEAM statement
is delayed until all the other images have executed the same block the
same number of times.

Note:

  The deallocation of an allocatable coarray that was not allocated at
  the beginning of a CHANGE TEAM construct, but was allocated at the
  end of the construct, occurs even for allocatable coarrays with the
  SAVE attribute.


5.4 SYNC TEAM statement

R504 sync-team-stmt is SYNC TEAM (team-variable, [, sync-stat-list])

Execution of a SYNC TEAM statement performs a synchronization of the
images of the team specified by the team-variable. Execution on an
image, M, of the segment following the SYNC TEAM statement is delayed
until each other image of the specified team has executed a SYNC TEAM
statement specifying the same team as many times as has image M. The
segments that executed before the SYNC TEAM statement on an image
precede the segments that execute after the SYNC TEAM statement on
another image.

NOTE:

  A SYNC TEAM statement performs a synchronization of images of a
  particular team whereas a SYNC ALL statement performs a
  synchronization of all images of the current team.

[In 8.5.1 Image control statements, paragraph 2]
Add extra bullet point:
 SYNC TEAM





5.5 STAT_FAILED_IMAGE

The value of the default integer scalar constant STAT_FAILED_IMAGE is
different from the value of STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE, STAT_LOCKED,
STAT_LOCKED_OTHER_IMAGE, or STAT_UNLOCKED. Its value is assigned to
the variable specified in a STAT=specifier or STAT argument in an
image control statement or the invocation of a collective procedure if
execution of the statement involves synchronization with an image of
the current team that has failed or accessing a variable on an image
of the current team that has failed.  A failed image is one for which
references or definitions of data fail when that data should be
accessible, or the image fails to respond as part of a collective
activity. A failed image remains failed for the remainder of the
program execution.  What constitutes a failed image is processor
dependent.

   NOTE 5.1
   A failed image is usually associated with a hardware failure 
   of the processor, memory system, or interconnection network.
   

------------------------------------
[13:1] Change "New intrinsic" to "Intrinsic".

------------------------------------
[13:3-5] Change "subroutines" to "procedures" twice and add these
names to the list of intrinsics: SUBTEAM_ID, FAILED_IMAGES,
FORM_SUBTEAM, TEAM_DEPTH.

------------------------------------
[13:7+] Add a new paragraph to 7.1 General:

"The intrinsic procedures THIS_IMAGE and NUM_IMAGES described in
clause 13 of ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010 are extended as described in 7.4."

------------------------------------
[13:16+] Add

"All the collective subroutine have optional arguments STAT and ERRMSG.
      
If the STAT argument is present, successful invocation of a collective
subroutine causes the argument to become defined with the value zero.

If the STAT argument is present in an invocation of a collective and the 
execution involves synchronization with an image that has initiated 
termination or failed, the argument becomes defined with the value of 
the constant STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE (13.8.2.24) or STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, 
respectively, in the intrinsic module ISO FORTRAN_ENV (13.8.2). The 
effect the invocation is that any argument of INTENT(OUT) or 
INTENT(INOUT) becomes undefined and a SYNC MEMORY statement is executed. 
If any other error condition occurs, the STAT argument becomes defined 
with a processor-dependent positive integer value that is different from 
the value of STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE or STAT_FAILED_IMAGE.

If an ERRMSG argument is present in an invocation of a collective
subroutine and an error condition occurs during its execution, 
the processor shall assign an explanatory message to the argument. 
If no such condition occurs, the processor shall not change the value of 
the argument."

------------------------------------ 

[15-17] For each of the collective subroutines, add at the end of the
argument list "[,STAT] [,ERRMSG]" and add to the argument descriptions

"STAT(optional)  shall be a scalar integer. It is an INTENT(OUT) argument.
     The effect of this argument is described in 7.2.  
     
ERRMSG(optional) shall be a scalar of type default character. It is an 
     INTENT(OUT) argument.  The effect of this argument is described in  
     7.2."
     
------------------------------------
[13:17] Change "subroutines" to "procedures".  

------------------------------------
[17:44+] Add

7.3.11 FAILED_IMAGES ([KIND])

Description. Indices of failed images.

Class. Transformational function.

Argument.

KIND (optional) shall be a scalar integer constant expression. It
shall be a kind type parameter for the type INTEGER. The range for
integers of this KIND shall be at least as large as for default
integer.

Result Characteristics. Integer. If KIND is present, the kind type
parameter is that specified by the value of KIND; otherwise, the kind
type parameter is that of default integer type. The result is an array
of rank one whose size is equal to the number of failed images.

Result. The elements of the result are the values of the image indices
of the failed images in the current team, in numerically increasing
order.

Examples. If image 3 is the only failed image in the current team
FAILED_IMAGES() has the value [3]. If there are no failed images in
the current team FAILED_IMAGES() is a zero-sized array.


7.3.12 FORM_SUBTEAM (SUBTEAM_ID, SUBTEAM [,STAT, ERRMSG])

Description. Subdivide the current team into subteams.

Class. Collective subroutine.

Arguments.

SUBTEAM_ID shall be scalar and of type default integer. It is an
INTENT(IN) argument. Its value specifies the subteam to which the
executing image will belong.

SUBTEAM shall be a scalar team variable. It shall not describe the current 
team or an ancestor of the current team. It is an INTENT(OUT) argument. 
After successful execution of the subroutine, SUBTEAM describes the 
the subteam specified by SUBTEAM_ID. 

STAT(optional)  shall be a scalar integer. It is an INTENT(OUT) argument.
     The effect of this argument is described in 7.2.  
     
ERRMSG(optional) shall be a scalar of type default character. It is an 
     INTENT(OUT) argument.  The effect of this argument is described in  
     7.2.

On successful execution of FORM_SUBTEAM, the images of the current team
will have been grouped into subteams and the SUBTEAM on each image
will represent the subteam of which the executing image is a member.
The subteam consists of all the images of the current team that
invoked the subroutine with the same value of SUBTEAM_ID.

Example.

CALL FORM_SUBTEAM ( 1+MOD(ME,2), ODD_EVEN ), with ME an integer with 
value IMAGE_INDEX() and ODD_EVEN of type TEAM_TYPE, divides the 
current team into two subteams according to whether the image index 
is even or odd. 

7.3.13 SUBTEAM_ID ([SUBTEAM_LEVEL])

Description. Subteam identifier.

Class. Transformational function.

Argument. SUBTEAM_LEVEL (optional) shall be a scalar nonnegative
integer expression.

Result Characteristics. Default integer scalar.

Result Value. If SUBTEAM_LEVEL is not present the result value is the
subteam identifier of the invoking image in the current team.  If
SUBTEAM_LEVEL is present with a value less than or equal to the
current nesting level of CHANGE TEAM construct executions, the result
has the value of the subteam identifier that the invoking image had at
the nesting level of CHANGE TEAM construct executions equal to
SUBTEAM_LEVEL. Otherwise, the result has the value 1.


Example. The following code illustrates the use of SUBTEAM_ID to
control which code is executed.

TYPE(TEAM_TYPE) :: ODD_EVEN
    :
ME = THIS_IMAGE()
CALL FORM_SUBTEAM ( 1+MOD(ME,2), ODD_EVEN )
CHANGE TEAM (ODD_EVEN)
  SELECT CASE (SUBTEAM_ID())
  CASE (1)
     :  ! Code for odd images in parent team
  CASE (2)
     :  ! Code for even images in parent team
  END SELECT
END TEAM


7.3.14 TEAM_DEPTH()

Description. Team depth for this image.

Class. Transformational.

Arguments. None.

Results characteristics. Scalar default integer.

Result value. The result of TEAM_DEPTH is an integer with a value
equal to the nesting depth of the CHANGE TEAM construct executions for
the invoking image relative to the initial team (which has depth 0).

Example.

PROGRAM TD
USE ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
INTEGER         :: I_TEAM_DEPTH
TYPE(TEAM_TYPE) :: SUBTEAM
CALL FORM_SUBTEAMS(1, SUBTEAM)
CHANGE TEAM(SUBTEAM)
   I_TEAM_DEPTH = TEAM_DEPTH()
END TEAM
END

On completion of the CHANGE TEAM construct, I_TEAM_DEPTH has the value
1.


------------------------------------
[17:44++] At the end of clause 7 add a new subclause:

7.4 Modified intrinsic procedures

7.4.1 NUM_IMAGES

The description of the intrinsic function NUM_IMAGES in ISO/IEC
1539-1:2010 is changed by adding two optional arguments SUBTEAM_LEVEL
and FAILED and a modified result if either is present.

The SUBTEAM_LEVEL argument shall be a nonnegative scalar integer. If
SUBTEAM_LEVEL is not present the result value is the number of images
in the current team.  If SUBTEAM_LEVEL is present with a value less
than or equal to the current nesting level of CHANGE TEAM construct
executions, the result has the value of the number of images in the
team of which invoking image was a member at the nesting level of
CHANGE TEAM construct executions equal to SUBTEAM_LEVEL. Otherwise,
the result has the value of the number of images in the initial team.

The FAILED argument shall be a scalar LOGICAL argument. Its value
determines whether the result is the number of failed images or the
number of nonfailed images.

***Need to incorporate the above into the structure below.
***

The Result value is modified to have four cases as follows:

   Case(i) The result of NUM_IMAGES ( ) is the total number of images 
           in the current team.
   Case (ii) The result of NUM_IMAGES (TEAM) is the total number of 
             images in TEAM. 

   Case(iii) If FAILED has the value true, the result of 
           NUM_IMAGES (FAILED=FAILED) is the number of failed images 
           in the current team and the result of 
           NUM_IMAGES (TEAM,FAILED) is the number of failed images in 
           TEAM. 
   Case(iv) If FAILED has the value false, the result of 
           NUM_IMAGES (FAILED=FAILED) is the number of working images 
           in the current team and the result of 
           NUM_IMAGES (TEAM,FAILED) is the number of working images in 
           TEAM. "


7.4.2 THIS_IMAGE

The description of the intrinsic function THIS_IMAGE( ) in ISO/IEC
1539-1:2010 is changed by adding an optional argument SUBTEAM_LEVEL
and a modified result if SUBTEAM_LEVEL is present.

The SUBTEAM_LEVEL argument shall be a scalar integer. It shall be
nonnegative. If SUBTEAM_LEVEL is not present the result value is the
image index of the invoking image in the current team.  If
SUBTEAM_LEVEL is present with a value less than or equal to the
current nesting level of CHANGE TEAM construct executions, the result
has the value of the image index that the invoking image had at the
nesting level of CHANGE TEAM construct executions equal to
SUBTEAM_LEVEL. Otherwise, the result has the value of the image index
that the invoking image had in the initial team.

   Case(iii) If FAILED has the value true, the result of 
           NUM_IMAGES (FAILED=FAILED) is the number of failed images 
           in the current team and the result of 
           NUM_IMAGES (TEAM,FAILED) is the number of failed images in 
           TEAM. 
   Case(iv) If FAILED has the value false, the result of 
           NUM_IMAGES (FAILED=FAILED) is the number of working images 
           in the current team and the result of 
           NUM_IMAGES (TEAM,FAILED) is the number of working images in 
           TEAM. "


{In 13.7.165 THIS_IMAGE ( ) or THIS_IMAGE (COARRAY [, DIM])}

In the title, change "THIS_IMAGE ( )" to "THIS_IMAGE ([SUBTEAM_LEVEL])"

In paragraph 3 Arguments, add new final item

   "SUBTEAM_LEVEL (optional) shall be a scalar integer. It shall
         be nonnegative. It shall not be a coarray."


In paragraph 5 Result Value, modify the first case to be

   "Case (i) : The result of THIS IMAGE ( ) is a scalar with a value
               equal to the index in the current team of the invoking
               image.

and add new item

   "Case (ia): If the value of SUBTEAM_LEVEL is less than or equal to
               the current nesting level of CHANGE TEAM construct
               executions, the result of THIS_IMAGE (SUBTEAM_LEVEL) is
               a scalar with a value equal to the image index that the
               invoking image had at the nesting level of CHANGE TEAM
               construct executions equal to SUBTEAM_LEVEL.

    Case (ib): If the value of SUBTEAM_LEVEL is greater than the
               current nesting level of CHANGE TEAM construct
               executions, the result of THIS_IMAGE (SUBTEAM_LEVEL) is
               a scalar with a value equal to the image index that the
               invoking image had in the initial team.

{In 13.8.2 The ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module} 

Move the paragraph and Note of subclause 5.4 of this Technical
Specification to become subclause 13.8.2.21b of F2008.

Move the two paragraphs of subclause 5.2 of this Technical
Specification to become subclause 13.8.2.25 of F2008.


------------------------------------
[20:5+] In 8.4 Edits to Annex A, add a new processor dependency:

  "what constitutes a failed image;"

------------------------------------
[21:3+] In Annex A, add a new subclause

"A.1 Clause 5 notes"

and renumber A.1 to A.2.

Example: Compute fluxes over land, sea and ice in different
         teams based on surface properties.
         Assumption: Each image deals with areas containing
                     exactly one of the three surface types.
