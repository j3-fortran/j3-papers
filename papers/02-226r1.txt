In Unresolved Issue 370 the Editor complained that we botched
use of the term "type-param-value".

This paper reflects the Last Word on the mailing list,
thanks for John and Richard.

Edits:

72:26-28. Move the sentence to 72:23+ and change it to  
"If a type parameter in a <declaration-type-spec> is
an expression that is not an initialization expression,
the type parameter value is established on entry to the procedure
and is not affected by any redefinition or undefinition of the
variables in the specification expression
during execution of the procedure."

73:0. Delete internal note.
