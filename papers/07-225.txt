Discussion:

Note 5.5 on page 91 indicates that the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute can both
"facilitate" and "disable" code motion optimizations. In the code
region between the data transfer statement and the corresponding WAIT
statement the compiler is constrained in that statements involving the
I/O list items cannot be moved across the boundaries of this
region. On the other hand, variables without the ASYNCHRONOUS
attribute are not affected by these constraints. This was the origin
of the "facilitates" sentence. Given the possible confusion, deleting
the last paragraph in Note 5.5 seems best.

Edits:
-----------

[91:3+1] In Note 5.5, delete the second paragraph.
