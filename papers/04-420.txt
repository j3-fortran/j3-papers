NUMBER:
TITLE: IEEE_SET/GET_UNDERFLOW_MODE
KEYWORDS: IEEE, underflow mode
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS: Submitted

QUESTION:

Is it allowed for the argument of IEEE_SET_UNDERFLOW_MODE or
IEEE_GET_UNDERFLOW_MODE to be an array?

There appears to be no restriction against arrays in these
procedures.  For IEEE_SET_UNDERFLOW_MODE, it is ill-defined
what an array would mean.  The wording implies a scalar, in
that it talks about being true or false, but the restriction
to scalars is not explicit. For IEEE_GET_UNDERFLOW_MODE, it
could be defined, but seems a little silly and nonparallel.

The similar procedures for rounding mode do explicitly
specify that their arguments are scalar.

ANSWER:

No, arrays are not allowed for these arguments.  Edits are provided
to correct this error.

EDITS:

[374:21] Add "scalar and" after "shall be"
[380:13] Add "scalar and" after "shall be"
