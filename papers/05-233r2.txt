Subject: Edits for long integers

References: WG5/N1626, item UK-005, 05-233, 05-233r1.

1. Introduction

This is work item UK-005 in WG5/N1626.
It is on the A-list.

2. Basic Requirement

Require the support of long integers declared thus:
  integer, parameter :: long = selected_int_kind(18)
  integer (long) :: l,m,n

3. Rationale

Long integers are needed increasingly in large programs, but if we make the
above declaration in a program we cannot be sure that it will compile.

4. Detailed Specification:

Require the support of integers whose kind type parameter value is
selected_int_kind(18).

5. Other considerations

Having a range requirement for integers but no requirement for the real type
looks a bit inconsistent - at the moment, zero is guaranteed to be a real
value, but that appears to be the only requirements on default real/double
precision.  However, REAL(c_float) and REAL(c_double) have requirements on
them, inherited from C (clause 5.2.4.2.2, p25-26) - which looks even more
inconsistent.

ADDITIONAL SPECIFICATION:
We should add minimum requirements for floating-point similar to C, which
has: for float: precision>=6, range>=37;
    for double: precision>=10, range>=37.
The first should be a recommendation for default real, the second should be a
requirement for double precision real.  (We don't need to be as strict as C,
since users can select small but adequate precision using SELECTED_REAL_KIND
rather than being limited to a single keyword "float".)

6. Syntax

There is no new syntax.

7. Editorial considerations

(1) This is trivial, requiring no additional implementation effort on the part
    of the vast majority of Fortran 95 compiler vendors.  Nothing new is
    apparent from the user side, other than the guarantee of portability.
    Therefore it does not warrant inclusion in the Introduction (it is not a
    "new" feature as such).

(2) The standard uses the phrasing "a processor shall" and "the processor
    shall" inconsistently.  It uses the former only 5 times (coincidentally
    mostly in the very clause we are editing now) and the latter 25 times (in
    clauses 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 13, 14 and 15).  We should fix the clauses 3&4
    version to be the same as in the rest of the standard.  Edits to do this
    will be included in 008 rather than here.

8. Edits to 04-007

Add a new paragraph after the first paragraph of subclause 4.4.1 "Integer
type", [36:20+]
  "The processor shall provide at least one representation method with
   a decimal exponent range greater than or equal to 18."
{This could be inserted into the first paragraph, but that is already long
enough.}

Add a new paragraph after the fourth paragraph of subclause 4.4.2 "Real type"
(that is immediately before "R416 <signed-real-literal-constant> <<is>>..."),
[38:13+]
  "The decimal precision of double precision real shall be at least
   10, and its decimal exponent range shall be at least 37.  It is
   recommended that the decimal precision of default real be at least 6,
   and that its decimal exponent range be at least 37."
