--------------------------------------------------------------

Begin Preface
=============

This paper represents a draft of the edits for feature uk-001,
co-arrays. This is a work in progress, and is not the final paper for
this subject.  It does contain many corrections and clarifications
compared to 05-272. It differs from the internal meeting 174 paper
05-272r1 only in the addition of this preface section.

The major remaining issues needing resolution are:

1) An improved explanation of the model for memory consistency between
   images and more specifics on the interpretation of the flush_memory
   operation, especially in the context of a cluster processor.

2) Editorial changes to convert a subset of the synchronization
   intrinsics into statements.

3) Possible simplification of the synchronization primitives.

End Preface
===========

Following are the edits to implement the UK-001 feature, 
co-arrays, as amended by paper J3/05-208.


Note 1. < and > are used to delimit italic font. << and >> are 
used to delimit bold font.

Note 2. Instead of overloading the array reduction functions with 
collective versions, we have add new functions called CO_ALL, etc. 
This is because the overloaded functions would no longer be pure.
The new functions have an optional argument TEAM, whose absence 
indicates that the team consists of all the images. We have 
introduced a new category of intrinsic function: collective function. 

Note 3. For consistency with the ALLOCATE statement, we now require 
all images of the connect team to execute the same OPEN statement. 

Note 4. We have added CO_MAXLOC and CO_MINLOC, which we believe were 
omitted in error in Delft.

Note 5. All page and line numbers refer to j3/04-007.

[xiii] Introduction, the list of new Fortran 2008 features should 
include

  Parallel programming support: SPMD parallel programming, co-arrays
  for data exchange between images, synchronization procedures, and 
  collective procedures.

In section 1.6 Compatibility, retain paragraph 3:5-9 regarding new 
intrinsic procedure names. There are new intrinsics introduced in 
this proposal. There are no other compatibility issues introduced in
the proposal.

[1:18+] Add new section after 1.2

1.2a Images

A Fortran program executes as if it were replicated a number of 
times (which may be one), the number of replications remaining fixed
during execution of the program and available from the intrinsic 
function NUM_IMAGES().  

Each copy is called an <<image>> and has its own set of data objects.
The images execute asynchronously. The programmer controls the 
progress of execution in each image through explicit use of Fortran 
control constructs and through explicit use of intrinsic 
synchronization procedures. Co-arrays provide a mechanism for 
accessing data on one image from another image.

Each image is indexed by an <<image index>>. These form a sequence 
of integers running from one to NUM_IMAGES(). The programmer may 
retrieve the index of the invoking image from the intrinsic 
function THIS_IMAGE().

NOTE 1.0. 
A particular implementation may permit the number of images to 
be chosen at compile time, at link time, or at execute time. The 
number of images may be the same as the number of physical 
processors, or it may be more, or it may be less. 
[end NOTE]
 
NOTE 1.0a.  It is usual for the program to be written for any number
of images and the actual number for a specific run to be specified
when the program is executed. This allows the program to be developed
with fewer images than will be used in the eventual production runs.
If the system is a uniprocessor, the processor knows that the number
of images is 1 and can take advantage of this. Thus the early testing
of the program can be performed on a uniprocessor.  For compilation
for a multiprocessor, the vendor could supply a switch to specify that
the number of images is 1, which would permit the optimizer to
eliminate overhead associated with parallel execution.  [end NOTE]

A <<team>> of images is a set of images that are collaborating in a 
computation. The members of the team are specified by a rank-one 
default integer array that holds the image indices, with no 
duplications.

.....................................................................
[11:1-] Add to R213

      <<or>> <critical-construct>

.....................................................................
[15:20] Replace the first sentence of the last paragraph of 2.3.4 by

Normal termination of execution of the program occurs on all images 
if a STOP statement or <end-program-stmt> is executed on an image.

......................................................................
[15:25+] Add at the end of 2.3.4

NOTE 2.2a 
If synchronization is required before all images complete execution, a
synchronization statement (8.5) should be employed ahead of the STOP
statement or <end-program-stmt>.
[end NOTE]

......................................................................
[18:20+] Add new subsection to 2.4.5

2.4.5a Co-array

A <<co-array>> is a data entity declared with a <co-array-spec> in 
square brackets. Within an image, it is normally accessed without use 
of co-subscripts in square brackets and its properties are exactly 
those that it would have had without the <co-array-spec> except that 
its value may be referenced or defined by other images. For example, 
the rank, bounds, extents, size, and shape are given by the data in 
parentheses in its declaration or allocation. 

The part of a co-array stored in the memory of a specified image may
be addressed by using co-subscripts in square brackets. Each
co-subscript shall be a scalar integer expression.

An object whose designator includes square brackets is a <<co-array 
subobject>>. For each co-array, subscripts in square brackets are 
known as <<co-subscripts>> and are mapped to image indices in the 
same way as Fortran array subscripts are mapped to the position of 
the array element in array element order.

NOTE 2.4a
The use of square brackets for array constructors does not conflict
with their use for co-arrays because the square left bracket of the 
co-array syntax is immediately preceded by a variable.
[end NOTE]

On each image, the image index is available from the intrinsic
function THIS_IMAGE with no arguments, the set of subscript values for
a co- array A that correspond to the image are available as
THIS_IMAGE(A), and the image index that corresponds to a set of
subscript values SUB for a co-array A is available as
IMAGE_INDEX(A,SUB).

NOTE 2.4b
For example, on image 5, for the co-array declared as
        REAL :: A(10,20)[10,0:9,0:*]  
THIS_IMAGE() has the value 5 and THIS_IMAGE(A) has the value 
(/ 5,0,0 /). For the same example on image 213, THIS_IMAGE(A) 
has the value (/ 3,1,2 /). 
[end NOTE]

NOTE 2.4c
On a shared-memory machine, we expect a co-array to be 
implemented as if it were an array of higher rank. On a 
distributed-memory machine with separate physical memory for each 
image, a co-array may be stored at the same virtual address in 
each physical processor. On any machine, a co-array may be 
implemented in such a way that each image can calculate the 
virtual address of an element on another image relative to the 
array start address on that other image. An implementation might 
arrange for each co-array to be stored at the same virtual 
address in each image, but this is not required. 
[end NOTE]

The <<co-rank>> of a co-array is the number of co-subscripts. The 
<<co-bounds>> and <<co-extents>> are given within square 
brackets in the co-array's declaration or allocation. The <<co-size>> 
of a co-array is always equal to the number of images.

......................................................................
[19:5] In the last line of the first paragraph of 2.5.1, after 
'array element selectors,' add 'image selectors,'.

......................................................................
[28:4+] Insert 'END CRITICAL' in the table in 3.3.1

......................................................................
[50:6+] After the second line of R441, add 
          <<or>> DIMENSION [(<deferred-shape-spec-list>)] 
          <left-square-bracket> <co-array-spec> <right-square-bracket>

......................................................................
[50:9+] After the first line of R442, add 
      [<left-square-bracket><co-array-spec><right-square-bracket>] 

......................................................................
[50:25+] After C440, add

C440a (R440) Each <co-array-spec> shall be a 
<deferred-shape-spec-list> and the component shall be specified 
with the ALLOCATABLE attribute.

......................................................................
[51:20+] Before NOTE 4.28, add new paragraph:

A data component is a co-array if its <component-decl> contains 
a <co-array-spec> or its <data-component-def-stmt> contains a 
DIMENSION <component-attr-spec> with a <co-array-spec>. If the 
<component-decl> contains a <co-array-spec>, it specifies the 
co-rank; otherwise, the <co-array-spec> in the DIMENSION 
<component-attr-spec> specifies the co-rank.

......................................................................
[71:21+] In R503, after the DIMENSION line, add 

    <<or>> DIMENSION [(<array-spec>)] 
          <left-square-bracket><co-array-spec><right-square-bracket>

......................................................................
[72:9] Separate R504 into two lines after '[(<array-spec>)]' and 
insert line:
       [<left-square-bracket><co-array-spec><right-square-bracket>]

......................................................................
[72:25+] After C510, add

C510a (R501) A co-array that has the ALLOCATABLE attribute shall 
be specified with a <co-array-spec> that is a <deferred-shape-
spec-list>.

......................................................................
[72:33] In the second line of C514, after 'an allocatable entity,' add 
'a co-array'.

......................................................................
[73:1+] After C517, add

C517a (R501) The SAVE attribute shall be specified for a co-array 
unless it is allocatable, a dummy argument, or declared in the main 
program.

NOTE 5.2a
An allocatable co-array is not required to have the SAVE attribute 
because a recursive procedure may need separate allocatable 
co-arrays at each level of recursion. 
[end NOTE]

C517b (R501). If an object of derived type has a co-array component 
at any level of component selection, each ancestor of the co-array 
component shall be a non-allocatable non-pointer scalar.

C517c (R501). The POINTER attribute shall not be specified for a co-
array. 

NOTE 5.2b.
A co-array may be of a derived type with pointer or allocatable 
components. The targets of such components always reside on the
same image as the structure containing the component.

If a large array is needed on a subset of images, it is wasteful
of memory to specify it directly as a co-array.  Instead, it 
should be specified as an allocatable component of a co-array 
and allocated only on the images on which it is needed. 
[end NOTE]

......................................................................
[74:19+] After the definition of an automatic data object, add a new
constraint:

C538a (R501) An automatic data object shall not be a co-array.

......................................................................
[74:20-] After NOTE 5.3, add a new note:


NOTE 5.3a
Automatic co-arrays are not permitted; for example, the co-array 
WORK in the following code fragment is not permitted to be declared 
thus
       SUBROUTINE SOLVE3(N,A,B)
       INTEGER :: N
       REAL :: A(N)[*], B(N)
       REAL :: WORK(N)[*]  ! Not permitted
[end NOTE]

......................................................................
[78:3-9] Replace the first paragraph of 5.1.2.5 by

The <<DIMENSION attribute>> specifies that an entity is an array, a 
co-array, or both. The appearance of an <array-spec> or a <co-array-
spec> in an <entity-decl> specifies the DIMENSION attribute for the 
entity. Such an entity is an array if an <array-spec> appears and is 
a co-array if a <co-array-spec> appears. The DIMENSION attribute 
alternatively may be specified in the specification statements 
DIMENSION, ALLOCATABLE, POINTER, TARGET, or COMMON.

For an array, the rank or rank and shape is specified by the <array-
spec>, if there is one, in the <entity-decl>, or by the <array-spec> 
in the DIMENSION <attr-spec> otherwise. For a co-array, the co-rank 
or co-rank and co-shape are specified by the <co-array-spec>, if there
is one, in the <entity-decl>, or by the <co-array-spec> in the 
DIMENSION <attr-spec> otherwise. 

......................................................................
***Note to Editor: This edit replaces the one for this line from 
05-234r2

[78:14] Replace C541 by

R510a <co-array-spec> <<is>> <deferred-shape-spec-list>
                      <<or>> <assumed-size-spec>

C541 (R510 and R510a) The sum of the rank and co-rank shall not 
exceed fifteen.

......................................................................
[85:6] Replace the last word, "program." of the first sentence of
5.1.2.16 Volatile, with

program, or by execution of statements on another image.

......................................................................
[87:34+] After R529, add

C552a (R525). A <data-stmt-set> shall not contain any image 
              selectors (6.2a). 

......................................................................
[90:2-5] Replace the contents of 5.2.6 by

R535  <dimension-stmt> <<is>> DIMENSION [::] <dimension-decl-list>

R535a <dimension-decl> <<is>> <array-name>(<array-spec>) 
                       <<or>> <co-array-name>[(<array-spec>)] 
            <left-square-bracket><co-array-spec><right-square-bracket>

This statement specifies the DIMENSION attribute (5.1.2.5) and 
the array and co-array properties for each object named.

......................................................................
[91:19+] After C570, add

C570a (R544). A common block that contains a co-array shall be 
specified to have the SAVE attribute in every scoping 
unit in which it appears. 

......................................................................
[92:4-5] Replace R546 by

R546  <target-stmt> <<is>> TARGET [::] <target-decl-list>

R546a <target-decl> <<is>> <object-name>[(<array-spec>)] 
          [<left-square-bracket><co-array-spec><right-square-bracket>]

......................................................................
[96:12+] After C577, add

C577a (R556). An <equivalence-object> shall not contain an image 
selector (6.2a). 

......................................................................
[98:22+] After C588, add

C588a (R558). A <common-block-object> shall not contain an image 
selector (6.2a). 

C588b (R558). Blank common shall not contain a co-array. 

......................................................................
[105:2] Append to the end of R613 '[<image-selector>]'

......................................................................
[110:2-] Add new section at the end of 6.2. 

6.2a Image selectors

An <<image selector>> specifies the image whose data are referenced or 
defined.

R622a <image-selector> <<is>> 
          <left-square-bracket><subscript-list><right-square-bracket>

The value of a subscript in an image selector shall be within the 
bounds for its co-dimension. An image selector shall select an image 
with index in the range 1, ..., NUM_IMAGES().

NOTE 6.15a
For example, if there are 16 images and the co-array A is 
declared
    REAL :: A(10)[5,*]
A(:)[1,4] is valid since it has co-subscript order value 16, but
A(:)[2,4] is invalid.
[end NOTE]

......................................................................
[110:20] In R628, after '[(<allocate-shape-spec-list>)]' add the
new line '[<left-square-bracket><allocate-co-array-spec>
<right-square-bracket>]'.

......................................................................
[111:5+] After R632, add 'R632a <allocate-co-array-spec> <<is>> 
[<allocate-shape-spec-list>,] [<lower-bound-expr>:]* '.

......................................................................
[111:17] Add at the end of C628 'An <allocate-co-array-spec> shall 
appear if and only if the <allocate-object> is a co-array.'

......................................................................
[111:19] Add at the end of C629 'The number of <allocate-shape-spec>s 
in an <allocate-co-array-spec> shall be one less than the co-rank of 
the <allocate-object>.'

......................................................................
[111:25+] After C633, add

C633a (R629) An <allocate-object> shall not be co-array subobject.
NOTE 6.15a
If a co-array is of a derived type that has an allocatable component, 
the component shall be allocated only on the local image:

      TYPE(SOMETHING), ALLOCATABLE ::  T[:]
        ...
      ALLOCATE(T[*])          !  Allowed - implies synchronization
      ALLOCATE(T%PTR(N))      !  Allowed - local allocation
      ALLOCATE(T[Q]%PTR(N))   !  Not allowed 
[end NOTE]

......................................................................
[113:21+] At the end of 6.3.1.1, add

The value of each <lower-bound-expr> and each <upper-bound-expr> in 
an <allocate-co-array-spec> shall not differ between images. 

If a <type-spec> appears in an ALLOCATE statement and any <allocation>
specifies a co-array, the values of each length type parameter shall
not differ between images.

If SOURCE= appears in an ALLOCATE statement and the <allocation>
specifies a co-array, the values of each length type parameter of the
<source-expr> shall not differ between images.

The dynamic type of an <allocate-object> that is a co-array shall not
differ between images. 

There is implicit synchronization of all images in association 
with each ALLOCATE statement that involves one or more co-
arrays. Images do not commence executing subsequent statements 
until all images finish executing the ALLOCATE statement. This 
synchronization is independent of those obtained by calling 
SYNC_ALL or SYNC_TEAM.

NOTE 6.19a
When an image executes an ALLOCATE statement, communication is not
necessarily involved apart from any required for synchronization.  The
image allocates the local part and records how the corresponding parts
on other images are to be addressed.  The processor, except perhaps in
debug mode, is not required to enforce the rule that the bounds are
the same on all images, nor is it responsible for detecting
or resolving deadlock problems.
[end NOTE]

......................................................................
[116:19-] At the end of 6.3.3.1, add

There is implicit synchronization of all images in association 
with each DEALLOCATE statement that involves one or more co-
arrays. All images delay making the deallocations until they are 
all about to execute the DEALLOCATE statement. This 
synchronization is independent of those obtained by calling 
SYNC_ALL or SYNC_TEAM.

If an object that has a co-array component at any level of component 
selection is declared in a procedure and does not have the SAVE
attribute, there is an implicit deallocation (and associated 
synchronization) before the procedure in which it is declared is 
exited by execution of a RETURN or END statement.

NOTE 6.25a
An allocatable co-array without the SAVE attribute may be required if 
separate arrays are needed at each level of recursion in a recursive 
procedure. For allocation of such a co-array, each image must descend 
to the same level of recursion or deadlock may occur.
[end NOTE]

......................................................................
[139:1+] Add to the end of the first paragraph of 7.4.1.2:

If <variable> is an allocatable co-array, it shall be allocated and
the shapes of <variable> and <expr> shall conform. If <variable> is a
co-array subobject of a type that has an allocatable component at any
level of component selection, the shapes of the corresponding
components of <variable> and <expr> shall conform.

C715a (R734) The <variable> in an intrinsic assignment statement shall
not be a co-array subobject of a derived type that has a pointer
component.

NOTE 7.34a
The restriction in C715a is needed to avoid a disallowed pointer 
assignment for the component, such as
       Z[I] = Z ! Not allowed if Z has a pointer component 
       Z = Z[I] ! Not allowed if Z has a pointer component 
[end NOTE]

......................................................................
[143:31+] After C723, add 

C723a (R739) A <data-target> shall not be a co-array subobject. 

NOTE 7.42a
A pointer and its target always reside on the same image. A co-array 
may be of a derived type with pointer or allocatable components. For 
example, if P is a pointer component, Z[I]%P is a reference to the 
target of component P of Z on image I. This target must reside on 
image I and must have been established by an allocate statement 
executed on image I or a pointer assignment executed on image I.
[end NOTE]

......................................................................
[143:37+] After C725, add 

C725a (R741) The <variable> in a <proc-component-ref> shall not be a 
co-array subobject. 

NOTE 7.42b
A co-array is permitted to be of a type that has a procedure pointer
component or a type bound procedure. Such a procedure shall not be 
invoked remotely; for example, the statement
      CALL A[I]%PROC(X) ! Remote reference not allowed
is not permitted. 
[end NOTE]

......................................................................
[155:2] At the start of 8, after 'The execution sequence' add 
'of a single image'. 

[155:3] In the second line of 8, after 'execution sequence.' add 
'This is the subject of 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4; image synchronization 
for exchange of data between images is the subject of 8.5.'

......................................................................
[170:25-26] Change the first two sentences of 8.4 to

Execution of a STOP statement on an image causes normal termination 
(2.3.4) of execution of the program on all images. At the time of
termination, the stop code from the image executing the STOP 
statement, if any, is available in a processor dependent manner. At 
most one image shall make a stop code available.

......................................................................
***Note to Editor: This edit should be applied following the edit for
[170:29+] from 05-231r4

[170:29+] After 8.4, add new section:

8.5 Image synchronization for exchange of data between images

All images are synchronized before executing the first executable
statement of the program.

Most of the time, each image executes on its own without regard to 
the execution of other images. Whenever an image
 (1) defines a co-array datum, no other image shall be in the process
     of defining it, 
 (2) defines a co-array datum, no other image shall still need the 
     old value, and
 (3) references a co-array datum, it shall not be an old value that 
     needs to be defined by another image. 
The program may use invocations of the intrinsic synchronization 
procedures or a CRITICAL construct to do this, and the program should 
make no assumptions about the execution timing on different images.

NOTE 8.22
This obligation on the program provides the processor with scope 
for optimization. When constructing code for execution on an image, 
it may assume that it is the only image in execution until the next 
invocation of one of the intrinsic synchronization procedures and 
thus it may use all the optimization techniques available on a single 
image. 
[end NOTE]

8.5.1 Flushing temporary memory

If the processor employs temporary memory such as cache or registers
(or even packets in transit between images) to hold co-array data,
such data is visible to another image only after it has been copied to
memory that can be accessed by the other image. If another image
defines local co-array data, that data may need to be copied into the
temporary memory of the executing image before it is referenced.  The
intrinsic procedure FLUSH_MEMORY (13.7.39a) is provided for both
purposes. It is concerned only with data held in temporary memory on
the executing image for co-arrays in the local scope. Given this
fundamental intrinsic procedure, the other synchronization procedures
can be programmed in Fortran (see Annex C.9a.1), but the intrinsic
versions are likely to be more efficient. In addition, the program
may use it to express customized synchronization operations in
Fortran.

If data calculated on one image are to be accessed on another, the
first image shall call FLUSH_MEMORY after the calculation is complete
and the second shall call FLUSH_MEMORY before accessing the data.
Synchronization is needed to ensure that FLUSH_MEMORY is called on the
first before FLUSH_MEMORY is called on the second.

NOTE 8.23
A processor can hold co-arrays in temporary storage, such as cache or 
registers, between calls to FLUSH_MEMORY.
[end NOTE]

NOTE 8.24
If the local part of a co-array or a subobject of it is an actual 
argument corresponding to a dummy argument that is not a co-array, a 
copy may be passed to the procedure. To avoid the possibility of the 
original being altered by another image after the copy has been made, 
a synchronization may be needed ahead of the procedure invocation. 
Similarly, a synchronization is needed after return before any other 
image accesses the result.
[end NOTE]

8.5.2 Synchronizing images

The intrinsic subroutine SYNC_TEAM (13.7.116b) provides
synchronization for a team of images. The intrinsic subroutine
SYNC_ALL (13.7.116a) provides a shortened call for the important case
where the team consists of all the images. Each invocation of
SYNC_TEAM or SYNC_ALL also has the effect of FLUSH_MEMORY.  The
subroutine SYNC_ALL is not discussed further in this section.

NOTE 8.25

No information is available about whether an action on one image
occurs before or after an action on another image unless one action is
executed ahead of a synchronization call on one image and the other
action is executed behind the corresponding synchronization call on
the other image.  For example, while one image executes the statements
between two invocations of SYNC_ALL, another image might be waiting to
return from the second SYNC_ALL. Here is a example that imposes the
fixed order 1, 2, ... on images:
      ME = THIS_IMAGE()
      NE = NUM_IMAGES()
      IF(ME>1)  CALL SYNC_TEAM( ME-1 )
        P = P[ME-1] + 1
      IF(ME<NE) CALL SYNC_TEAM( ME+1 )
[end NOTE]

Teams are permitted to overlap, but for synchronizations to correspond
correctly, if a synchronization call for one team is made ahead of a
synchronization call for another team on a single image, the
corresponding calls shall be in the same order on all images in common
to the two teams.

NOTE 8.25 
The presence of the optional argument WAIT in a call to the intrinsic
procedures SYNC_ALL or SYNC_TEAM allows the invoking image to continue
execution without waiting for all the others in cases where it does
not need data from all the others. Judicious use of this optional
argument may improve the overall efficiency substantially. The
processor is not, however, required to cause immediate continued
execution.  The processor may choose to wait for the whole team, which
certainly more than satisfies the requirement that the members of WAIT
have arrived.
[end NOTE]

The FLUSH statement plays a similar role for file data to that of
FLUSH_MEMORY for co-array data. Because of the high overheads
associated with file operations, SYNC_TEAM does not also have the
effect of a FLUSH statement. If data written by one image to a file
are to be read by another image without closing the connection and re-
opening it on the other image, FLUSH statements are needed on both
images (details in 9.8).

8.5.3 Critical sections

Exceptionally, it may be necessary to limit execution of a <block>
to one image at a time. Such a <block> is called a critical section.

R851 <critical-construct> <<is>> <critical-stmt>
                                 <block> 
                                 <end-critical-stmt>
R852 <critical-stmt>      <<is>> [<critical-construct-name>:] CRITICAL    
R853 <end-critical-stmt>  <<is>> END CRITICAL 
                                 [<critical-construct-name>]   
C835 (R851) If the <critical-stmt> of a <critical-construct> specifies
a <critical-construct-name>, the corresponding <end-critical-stmt> 
shall specify the same <critical-construct-name>. If the 
<critical-stmt> of a <critical-construct> does not specify a 
<critical-construct-name>, the corresponding <end-critical-stmt> 
shall not specify a <critical-construct-name>. 

The effect of the construct is to limit the execution of <block> to a
single image at any time. Once an image has commenced executing
<block>, no other image shall commence executing it until the image
that first commenced its execution has completed executing it. There
is an implicit FLUSH_MEMORY at the beginning and end of <block>.

.....................................................................
[171:21+] At the end of 9, add new paragraph

All images reference a single file system.

.....................................................................
[173:29] At the end of 9.2.2.1, after 'statements.', add 
'Each record shall be read or written by a single image.'. 

.....................................................................
[178:36] At the end of the second paragraph of 9.4, after the second 
'program', add 'and on all images'. 

.....................................................................
[179:33] In the second line of 9.4.3, after 'external file', add 
', and the connection is for a team of images'. 

.....................................................................
[181:39+] At the end of R905, add

      <<or>> TEAM = <connect-team> 

.....................................................................
[181:41+] After R907, add

 R907a <connect-team> <<is>> <rank-one-int-expr> 

.....................................................................
[181:46+] After C905, add

 C905a A <rank-one-int-expr> is an <int-expr> that is of rank 
       one and type integer. 

.....................................................................
[185:4+] Add new subsection at the end of 9.4.5:

 9.4.5.16 TEAM= specifier in the OPEN statement

The <rank-one-int-expr> shall evaluate to a set of integers
that have values between 1 and NUM_IMAGES() and there shall be no 
repeated values. One element shall have the value THIS_IMAGE(). This 
specifies the <<connect team>> for the unit, which is the set of 
images that are associated with the unit. If there is no TEAM= 
specifier, the connect team is (/THIS_IMAGE()/).

All images in the connect team, and no others, shall invoke the same 
OPEN statement with identical values for the <connect-spec>s. The 
unit shall not be open on other images. There is an implied call to
SYNC_TEAM with TEAM=<connect-team> before and after the OPEN 
statement.  

The OPEN statement connects the file on the invoking images only, and 
the unit becomes unavailable on all other images.  If the OPEN 
statement is associated with a processor dependent file, the file is 
the same for all images in the connect team.

If the connect team contains more than one image, the OPEN statement 
shall have an ACCESS= specifier that evaluates to DIRECT or an ACTION=
specifier that evaluates to WRITE.

An OPEN statement on a unit already connected to a file shall have the 
same connect team as currently in effect.

A file shall not be connected to more than one unit, even if the
connect teams for the units have no images in common.

Pre-connected units that allow sequential input shall be accessible 
only on the image with index one. All other pre-connected units have a
connect team containing all the images.

NOTE 9.16a
The input unit identified by * is therefore only available on
the image with index one.
[end NOTE]

.....................................................................
[185:19+] Add new paragraph at the end of 9.4.6:

At the start of execution of a CLOSE statement, there is an implied

for the connect team before and after the CLOSE.

.....................................................................
[208:4+] Add new paragraph at the end of 9.7.1:

At the start of execution of a BACKSPACE statement, there is an 
implied FLUSH operation for the unit.  There are implied calls to 
SYNC_TEAM for the connect team before and after the BACKSPACE.

.....................................................................
[208:19+] Add new paragraph at the end of 9.7.2:

At the start of execution of an ENDFILE statement, there is an implied 
FLUSH operation for the unit.  There are implied calls to SYNC_TEAM 
for the connect team before and after the ENDFILE.

.....................................................................
[208:23+] Add new paragraph at the end of 9.7.3:

At the start of execution of a REWIND statement, there is an implied 
FLUSH operation for the unit.  There are implied calls to SYNC_TEAM 
for the connect team before and after the REWIND.

.....................................................................
[209:18-19] In the second paragraph of 9.8, change 
'to other processes, or causes data placed in an 
external file' to 'to other images of the same team or to other 
processes, or causes data placed in an external file by other images 
of the same team or'. 

......................................................................
[256:26] In the first line of 12.2.1.1, after 'its shape,' add 
'its co-shape,'.

......................................................................
[257:25+] In the first list of 12.3.1.1, add
     (a1) With an argument that is a co-array subobject (2.4.5a),

......................................................................
[257:33+] In the second list of 12.3.1.1, add 
     (b1) is a co-array,

......................................................................
[269:13+] In 12.4.1.2, Actual arguments associated with dummy data 
objects, add a new paragraph and note:

If the actual argument is a co-array subobject, the 
dummy argument shall not be a co-array and shall have the INTENT(IN) 
or the VALUE attribute.

NOTE 12.21a
If the actual argument is a co-array subobject and the corresponding
dummy argument is not a co-array, it is expected that implementations
will make a local copy of the actual argument before execution of the
procedure starts.
[end NOTE]

......................................................................
[269:17+] After the sixth paragraph of 12.4.1.2, add new paragraphs:

If a dummy argument is an allocatable co-array, the actual argument 
shall be an allocatable co-array of the same rank and co-rank.

If a dummy argument is a co-array that is not allocatable, the co-rank
and co-bounds are specified by the local declaration and are
completely independent of those of the actual argument. The actual
argument shall be the name of a co-array or a subobject of a co-array
without any co-subscripts, vector-valued subscripts, allocatable
component selection, or pointer component selection.

NOTE 12.22a
Only the local part of the co-array actual argument is specified and 
this is associated with the local part of the dummy co-array. It is 
assumed that the rest of the actual co-array consists of the 
corresponding parts on the other images. Here is an example
    INTERFACE
      SUBROUTINE SUB(X,Y)
        REAL :: X(:)[*], Y(:)[*]
      END SUBROUTINE SUB
    END INTERFACE
       :
    REAL, ALLOCATABLE :: A(:)[:], B(:,:)[:]
     :
    CALL SUB(A(:),B(1,:)) 
[end NOTE]

Each image independently associates each non-allocatable co-array
dummy argument with a co-array that is not a dummy argument (perhaps
through several layers of procedure calls). Any reference to a
co-array subobject of the dummy argument uses the local co-bounds and
co-rank.


NOTE 12.21b
A procedure with a co-array dummy argument might be called
simultaneously on all the images of a team with the same actual
co-array and the same bounds and co-bounds. However, there are other
possibilities; for example, a procedure might be called on a single
image to perform a calculation that needs data from other images.
[end NOTE]

If an assumed-shape array or a subobject of an assumed-shape array
appears as an actual argument corresponding to a dummy co-array, the
dummy co-array shall be of assumed shape. 

A pointer component, an allocatable component that is not a co-array, 
or a subobject of such a component shall not be an actual argument 
that corresponds to a co-array dummy argument.

If an array section appears as an actual argument corresponding to a 
dummy co-array that is not of assumed shape, the section shall be 
contiguous [term will be defined by another proposal].

NOTE 12.21c
It is intended to ensure that copy-in or copy-out does not take
place for a dummy co-array. 
[end NOTE]

......................................................................
[270:6] In thhe first full paragraph on page 270, replace 
"corresponding actual argument has the TARGET attribute" with

corresponding actual argument that is not a co-array sub-object and
has the TARGET attribute

......................................................................
[271:6] In constraint C1232, replace the beginning of the first 
sentence: "If an actual argument is an array section or an 
assumed-shape array," with

If an actual argument is an array section or an assumed-shape array 
that is not a co-array subobject

......................................................................
[279:21+] After R1224, add

C1233a (R1223) A function result shall not be a co-array.

......................................................................
***Note to Editor: This text should be added before the Note edited by 
05-237r3

[287:7+] After C1276, add

C1276a A pure subprogram shall not contain a reference or definition 
of any part of a co-array. 

......................................................................
[291:12] In the fifth line of 13.1, after 'described in 12.7' add 
'A <<collective function>> is one that has a co-array argument and, on 
each image of a team, returns a result of the same shape, each element 
of which is calculated from the values of the corresponding elements 
on all the images of the team. It shall be invoked on all images of
the team with its co-array argument having the same shape. 
Synchronization of the images of the team occurs before and after 
execution.'

......................................................................
[291:14] In the seventh line of 13.1, change 'standard intrinsic' to 
'inquiry, elemental, and transformational intrinsic'.

......................................................................
[297:25+] After 13.5.14, add new subsection:

13.5.14a Collective functions

CO_ALL(MASK[,TEAM])        True if all values are true
CO_ANY(MASK[,TEAM])        True if any value is true
CO_COUNT(MASK[,TEAM,KIND]) Numbers of true elements 
CO_MAXLOC(ARRAY[,TEAM])    Image indices of maximum values 
CO_MAXVAL(ARRAY[,TEAM])    Maximum values 
CO_MINLOC(ARRAY[,TEAM])    Image indices of minimum values 
CO_MINVAL(ARRAY[,TEAM])    Minimum values
CO_PRODUCT(ARRAY[,TEAM])   Products of elements
CO_SUM(ARRAY[,TEAM])       Sums of elements

NOTE 13.6a
These functions return an array of the same shape as the given co-
array after having applied an operation across the images involved.
The simple case of wanting the operation to be applied to all the 
elements of the co-array can easily be programmed, for example
    REAL FUNCTION GLOBAL_SUM(ARRAY)
       REAL      :: ARRAY(:,:)[*]
       REAL,SAVE :: TEMP[*]
       TEMP = SUM(ARRAY) ! Local sum
       GLOBAL_SUM = CO_SUM(TEMP)
    END FUNCTION GLOBAL_SUM
Versions with other arguments can be programmed similarly, see C.9a.3.

If ARRAY has size zero and type character, the result has the value 
of a string of characters of length LEN(ARRAY), with each character 
equal to CHAR(n-1, KIND=KIND(ARRAY)), where n is the number of 
characters in the collating sequence for characters with the kind 
type parameter of ARRAY.

C.9a Section 13 notes

C.9a.1 The synchronization intrinsics in Fortran   

The simple module shown below uses FLUSH_MEMORY to implement the other
synchronization intrinsics. Its purpose is illustrative. Actual
implementations should provide intrinsic procedures that would be more
efficient than these and provide extra checks, at least in debug mode,
of correct usage.

We identify corresponding calls of SYNC_TEAM by counting, for
each pair P and Q, the number of invocations C(P,Q) for a team
including image P on image Q.  If P and Q belong to more than one
team, their calls for each team are required to be in the same order,
so the calls correspond if and only if C(P,Q) and C(Q,P) have the
same value.

In a long run on a powerful machine, the counts C(P,Q) may get 
very large. We therefore use long integers to hold these counts.

The basic mechanism we use to force an image to wait for another image
is to make it execute a tight loop until co-array data are altered by
the other image.

The intrinsics THIS_IMAGE(ARRAY) and IMAGE_INDEX(ARRAY,SUB) cannot be 
coded in Fortran since ARRAY may be of any type and THIS_IMAGE(ARRAY)

We therefore require the bounds to be specified as integer arrays and 
we require the image index for THIS_IMAGE(ARRAY).

applied to all the elements of the co-array to produce a scalar 
result. Versions with other arguments can similarly be programmed, 
for example

    REAL FUNCTION GLOBAL_SUM_MASK(ARRAY,MASK)
       REAL :: ARRAY(:,:)[*],MASK(:,:)
       TEMP = SUM(ARRAY,MASK=MASK) ! Local sum

       TEMP = SUM(ARRAY,DIM) ! Local sum
