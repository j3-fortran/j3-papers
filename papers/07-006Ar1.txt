Part 0 contains the summary status of all of the Fortran
       interpretations

Part 1 contains the interpretation processing rules from 00-142

Part 2 contains active F95 interpretations:

       - the remaining F95 interp numbers start with F95/
       - the F95 interps that are numbered 1-32 and 66-104
       - the F90 interps that are numbered F90/... and being
         interpreted against F95
       - there are no more Japanese F95 interps with their JP-...
         numbers

Part 3 contains active F2003 interpretations (prefixed with "F03/")

======================================================================
Part 1: Interpretation Processing Rules
======================================================================

0. All interpretations are listed in J3 standing document 006.

1. Interpretations are processed by the J3/interp group and given a
   number.  The interpretation is marked "J3 consideration in
   progress".  An answer is formulated and presented to J3 in a
   meeting paper.

2. J3 votes on the answer at a J3 meeting; a simple majority vote
   marks the answer as "passed by J3 meeting".

3. Between J3 meetings the chair of /interp sends a J3 letter ballot
   to J3 to approve interp answers that have been "passed by J3
   meeting".  The letter ballot runs for 30 days.  Not voting on
   three of four consecutive J3 letter ballots is grounds to
   terminate J3 membership.  An interp answer passes by a 2/3rds
   vote; a no vote must be accompanied by an explanation of the
   changes necessary to change the member's vote to yes.

   J3/interp reserves the right to recall an interp answer for more
   study even if the answer passes.

4. The chair of J3/interp gathers all interp answers that are marked
   "passed by J3 letter ballot" and forwards them to the WG5
   convenor.  The WG5 convenor holds a ballot of individual members;
   a no vote must be accompanied by an explanation of the changes
   necessary to change the member's vote to yes.  The answers that
   pass this ballot become "WG5 approved".

   J3/interp reserves the right to recall an interp answer for more
   study even if the answer passes.

5. "WG5 approved" answers are processed into a corrigendum document
   by taking the edits from the interp answers and putting them in
   the format required by ISO.  A WG5 vote is made on forwarding the

QUESTION:  Consider the following program.

      PROGRAM P
        INTEGER, TARGET :: T

        CALL SUB(FPTR())
      CONTAINS
        FUNCTION FPTR()
          INTEGER, POINTER :: FPTR

          FPTR => T
        END FUNCTION FPTR
        SUBROUTINE SUB(IO)
          INTEGER, INTENT(OUT) :: IO

          IO = 17
        END SUBROUTINE SUB
      END PROGRAM P

According to 12.4.1 [200:30-32],

    "If a dummy argument is not a pointer and the corresponding
     actual argument is a pointer, the actual argument shall be
     currently associated with a target and the dummy argument
     becomes argument associated with that target."

According to 12.4.1 [201:19-21],

    "If a dummy argument has INTENT(OUT) or INTENT(INOUT), the actual
     argument shall be definable."

According to 5.1.2.3 [53:29-31],

    "The INTENT(OUT) attribute specifies that. . . any actual
     argument that becomes associated with such a dummy argument
     shall be definable."

The definition of "definable" supplied in Annex A (the term does not
appear to be defined in normative text) is:

    "A variable is <<definable>> if its value may be changed by the
     appearance of its <name> or <designator> on the left of an
     <assignment statement>."

According to this definition, "definable" is a property of variables
only.  In the example above, the actual argument is not a variable.
However, the actual argument is pointer associated with an object
that is definable.  The text cited from 5.1.2.3 refers to the
"actual argument that becomes associated with the dummy argument",
but the first piece of text cited from 12.4.1 makes it clear that
when the actual argument is a pointer, it is the target with which
it is associated that becomes argument associated with the dummy
argument, and not the actual argument itself.

Was it the intent of the committee that this program should not be
standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

The program does not conform to the standard.

QUESTION:

Consider the following program.

PROGRAM questionable
  REAL,TARGET :: x
  CALL s1(f(x))
  CALL s2(f(x))
  CALL s3(f(x))
CONTAINS
  FUNCTION f(a)
    REAL,POINTER :: f

    variable = 42                  ! statement 2
  END SUBROUTINE
  SUBROUTINE s3(targ)
    REAL,TARGET :: targ
    REAL,POINTER :: p
    p => targ
    PRINT *,ASSOCIATED(p,x)        ! statement 3
  END SUBROUTINE
END

Is this program standard-conforming, and if so, what value is
printed?

The real question is whether an expression argument that is a pointer
function reference is treated as a variable (data-object) argument
with the variable being the target of the pointer expression.  (Or
whether it is dereferenced as usual in the absence of POINTER dummy
arguments).

Re (statement 1), the question is whether VARIABLE is definable when
argument-associated with "F()".

Re (statement 2), if the previous answer was Yes (VARIABLE is
definable), then presumably it can be made INTENT(OUT).  A random
sample of 4 compilers revealed that they considered it not to be
definable.

Re (statement 3), the question is whether P is pointer-associated
with X, not pointer-associated with X, or processor-dependent.  Of
the same random sample 3 thought it was associated with X, 1 thought
not.

ANSWER:

1. The call to s1 is not standard conforming. 12.5.2.1 says:

'A dummy data object whose intent is not specified is subject to the
limitations of the data entity that is the associated actual
argument.  That is, a reference to the dummy data object may occur
if the actual argument is defined and the dummy data object may be
defined if the actual argument is definable.'

Here the actual argument is a function result, which is not
definable.  For example, it is not permitted on the left-hand side
of an assignment statement, since it is not a variable.  (Being
"defined" or "undefined" is fundamentally a concept that applies only
to variables.)

2. The call to s2 is not standard conforming. 12.4.1.1 says:

'If a dummy argument has INTENT(OUT) or INTENT(INOUT), the actual
argument shall be definable.'

Again the actual argument is a function result, which is not
definable.

3. The call to s3 is standard conforming and the pointer assignment
in s3 causes p and x to become associated. This may be deduced from
12.4.1.1, which says [200:38-42]:

'If the dummy argument has the TARGET attribute and is either scalar
or is an assumed-shape array, and the corresponding actual argument
has the TARGET attribute but is not an array section with a vector
subscript (1) Any pointers associated with the actual argument become
associated with the corresponding dummy argument on invocation of the
procedure ...'

TITLE: Are dummy functions returning assumed-length character legal?
KEYWORDS: DUMMY FUNCTION, ASSUMED-LENGTH CHARACTER
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Are dummy functions returning assumed-length character legal?

Consider the following program:

        character*5 f
        external f
          call ss3(f)
        end
        subroutine ss3(ff)
        character*(*) ff, a*10
        external ff
          a = ff()//'99999999'
          print *, '<', a, '>'
        end
        function f()
        character*(*) f
          f = '123'
        end

The issue is the call to the dummy function 'ff' in subroutine 'ss3'.
Some compilers issue an error message. Others print the result:

 <123  99999>

There appear to be two relevant, contradictory passages in the F95
standard. Refer to section 5.1.1.5. <> means italics, [] means
obsolescent font.

The third constraint says "A function name shall not be declared with
an asterisk <char-len-param-value> [unless it is the name of the
result of an external function or the name of a dummy function.]

Before note 5.6 on the next page, the third bullet says:
(3) [In an external function, the name of the function result may be
specified with a character length parameter value of *; in this case,
any scoping unit invoking the function shall declare the function
name with a character length parameter value other than * or access
such a definition by host or use association. When the function is
invoked, the length of the result variable in the function is assumed
from the value of this type parameter.]

According to the standard, the use in the example program is legal,
because 'ff' is the name of a dummy function. But it seems clear that
the standard intended that the length of the variable returned by
a character function be known at compile time; it is not known in the
case where the function is a dummy function.

TITLE: Expressions in <type-spec> of a FUNCTION statement
KEYWORDS: expression - specification, expression - initialization,
          FUNCTION statement, host association, use association
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

The syntax rule R1217 shows that the type and type parameters of a
function can be specified in the FUNCTION statement (12.5.2.2).

(a) If a <type-spec> appears in a FUNCTION statement, can the
initialization and specification expressions of that <type-spec>
involve names of entities that are declared within the function or
are accessible there by host or use association?

(b) Section 5.1 states:

      "The <specification-expr> (7.1.6.2) of a <type-param-value>
       (5.1.1.5) or an <array-spec> (5.1.2.4) may be a nonconstant
       expression provided the specification expression is in an
       interface body (12.3.2.1) or in the specification part of a
       subprogram."

As a FUNCTION statement is not part of the specification part of a
subprogram, this text in the standard appears to distinguish between
FUNCTION statements that are in interface blocks and ones that are
not. This text seems to prohibit such examples as:

         INTEGER I
          ...
         CONTAINS
           CHARACTER*(I+1) FUNCTION F()
              ...
              COMMON // I
              ...

where it can be confusing as to which I is being referenced in the
FUNCTION statement.  While host association does not apply to
interface bodies, for consistency should the text quoted from Section
5.1 have been "... is in the specification part of an interface body
(12.3.2.1) or in the specification part of a subprogram."?

(c) Section 7.1.6.1 states:

      "If an initialization expression includes a reference to an
       inquiry function for a type parameter or an array bound of an
       object specified in the same <specification-part>, the type
       parameter or array bound must be specified in a prior
       specification of the <specification-part>."

Was this text intended to apply to FUNCTION statements even though
they are not part of any <specification-part>, thus disallowing
fragments such as:

      INTEGER (KIND=KIND(X)) FUNCTION F()
        INTEGER(KIND=KIND(0)) X
        ...

Similar text appears in Section 7.1.6.2.

ANSWER:

(a) A specification expression in the <type-spec> of a FUNCTION
statement may involve names of entities that are declared within the
function or are accessible there by host or use association, but an
initialization expression in such a <type-spec> may only involve
names that are accessible by host or use association.

(b) No.  It was not the intent of the standard to distinguish between
the two types of FUNCTION statements cited.  As elaborated in the
discussion of part (a), the standard intended to allow the
<type-spec> expression of a FUNCTION statement to be a nonconstant
expression.  The sentence cited is corrected with a supplied edit.

(c) Yes, the text cited from 7.1.6.1 was intended to apply to
FUNCTION statements.  The sentence quoted and the corresponding
sentence in 7.1.6.2 are corrected with supplied edits.  The code
fragment is not standard conforming.

Discussion:

(a) An initialization expression is a constant expression with an
additional rule relating to exponentiation (7.1.6.1).  Since it is a
constant expression, the only names it can contain are the names of
named constants, structure constructors, intrinsic procedures, and
variables whose type parameters or bounds are inquired about.

    * Named constant

      Section 5.1.2.1 states:

       "A named constant must not be referenced in any ... context
        unless it has been defined in a prior PARAMETER statement or
        type declaration statement using the PARAMETER attribute, or
        made accessible by use association or host association."

      Since the FUNCTION statement is the first statement of the
      scoping unit, there can be no prior PARAMETER statement or type
      declaration statement using the PARAMETER attribute, so the
      first clause does not apply. A named constant can appear in a
      <type-spec> of a function statement if it is accessible within
      the function by host or use association.

    * Structure constructor

      Rule R502 shows that the only opportunities for expressions to
      appear in <type-spec>s are in a <kind-selector> or in a
      <char-selector>.  However, a structure constructor can not
      appear in a <kind-selector> because rule R505 shows that a
      <kind-selector> must be an integer expression.  Similarly, R506
      shows that any initialization expression in a <char-selector>
      must be type integer.  Therefore, a structure constructor can
      not appear in an initialization expression in the <type-spec>
      of a FUNCTION statement.

    * Intrinsic procedure

      The intrinsic procedure names or classes of intrinsic
      procedures that may appear in an initialization expression are
      given in 7.1.6.1.

    * Variables whose type parameters or bounds are inquired about

      The text from section 7.1.6.1 as cited in question (c) was
      intended to apply to initialization expressions in the
      <type-spec> of a FUNCTION statement.  With the correction
      supplied, this means that if a variable appears as the argument
      to an inquiry intrinsic in the <type-spec> of a FUNCTION
      statement, the function must be a module procedure or an
      internal procedure, and the variable must exist in (be
      accessible from) the host scoping unit.

Rule R502 defines <type-spec>.  The only opportunity for a
<type-spec> to contain a <specification-expr> is when the data type
is character (<type-param-value> may be a <specification-expr>).
Section 7.1.6.2 states that a specification expression is a
restricted expression that is scalar, of type integer, and each
operation must be intrinsic.  In addition, rule (2) of 7.1.6.2 states
that a primary of a specification expression can be a dummy argument
that has neither the OPTIONAL nor INTENT(OUT) attribute.  The
following code fragment demonstrates a use of such a dummy argument:

              CHARACTER*(N+1) FUNCTION S(N)
              INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: N

Rule (2) also states that the primary can be a subobject of such a
dummy argument.  Section 6.1.2 indicates that a structure component
must not be referenced or defined before the declaration of the
parent object.  Similar rules are needed to prevent a substring from
being referenced ahead of the declaration of its parent, and an array
element or array section from being referenced ahead of the
declaration of the array.  Edits are provided to supply these rules.
Since a subobject can not be referenced before its parent object is
declared and the FUNCTION statement is the first statement of the
subprogram, the parent's declaration could not have occurred.  Thus a
subobject must not be referenced in the <type-spec> on a FUNCTION
statement for objects declared within the function.

Rule (3) states that a primary can be a variable that is in a common
block.  The following code fragment demonstrates a use of such a
common block member:

              CHARACTER*(N+1) FUNCTION S()
              ...
              COMMON N

As in rule (2), rule (3) allows a subobject of such a variable but
for the same reasons as above, such a subobject designator can not
appear in the <type-spec> expression of a FUNCTION statement.

Rule (4) states that a primary may be a variable that is accessible
by use association or host association.  The following code fragments
demonstrate uses of such variables:

              PROGRAM MAIN
              INTEGER :: N = 21
              ...
              CONTAINS
                CHARACTER(LEN = 2*N) FUNCTION SS(K)    ! N is host
                ...                                    !  associated.
                END FUNCTION
              END PROGRAM

    and

              MODULE MOD
              INTEGER K
              DATA K /20/
              END MODULE

              CHARACTER*(K*2) FUNCTION CHECK(STR)      ! K is use
                                                       !  associated.
              USE MOD
              ...
              END FUNCTION

Rule (4) also states that the primary can be a subobject of such a
use or host associated variable.

A structure constructor can not appear in a FUNCTION <type-spec>
specification expression because the expression must be of type
integer and any operations (which might yield an integer value from
one or more structure constructors) must be intrinsic.

Other rules of 7.1.6.2 state which intrinsic procedure names or
classes of intrinsic procedures may appear in a specification
expression.

Section 7.1.6.2 also states:

        A variable in a specification expression must have its type
        and type parameters, if any, specified by a previous
        declaration in the same scoping unit, or by the implicit type
        rules currently in effect for the scoping unit, or by host or
        use association.

The discussion above regarding specification expressions has already
ruled out "previous declarations" so the first clause of the cited
sentence does not apply.  The other clauses apply equally to a
FUNCTION statement <type-spec> and to type declaration statements
inside the function.

(b) When the discussion for part (a) is applied to the code fragment
provided, it means that the 'I' referenced in the <type-spec> of the
FUNCTION statement is the common block member.

TITLE: Referencing deferred bindings
KEYWORDS: Type-bound procedure, deferred binding
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress - Edit subsumed by interp F03/0004

QUESTION:

I thought that the intent was that it would be
impossible to reference a deferred binding.  However, it
doesn't appear to me that this intent was achieved.
Consider the following program (Sorry, but I don't have
any compilers up to syntax-checking this).

  module defer

    type, abstract :: t
    contains
      procedure (sub), nopass, deferred :: deferred_proc
    end type t
    type, extends(t) :: t2
    contains
      procedure :: deferred_proc => sub2
    end type t2

  contains
    subroutine sub
      write (*,*) 'Hello.'
    end subroutine sub
    subroutine sub2
      write (*,*) 'Goodbye.'
    end subroutine sub2
  end module defer
  program p
   use defer
   class(t), pointer :: x

   nullify(x)
   call x%deferred_proc

  end program p

Is this a valid program?  If not, what restriction of the
standard does it violate?

Note that x%deferred_proc does not require the value of x (4.5.7)
and thus is not a reference to x (2.5.6).  Therefore, [83:23-24]
does not prohibit this.  Nor is it clear that there is an intent
to prohibit invocation of type-bound procedures for disassociated
pointer objects; except in the case of deferred bindings, this
seems well-defined and potentially useful.

Because x is disassociated, its dynamic type is the same
as its declared type, thus making the interpretation of
x%nondeferred_proc reasonably clear.

ANSWER:

No, this was not intended to be a valid program.
An edit is supplied to clarify this situation.

TITLE: Type-bound procedures and undefined association status
KEYWORDS: Type-bound procedure, dynamic type
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

It appears that the dynamic type is undefined for a pointer with
undefined association status.  This impacts type-bound
procedures. Consider the following program.

  module undefined

    type :: t
    contains
      procedure, nopass :: nondeferred_proc => sub
    end type t
    type, extends(t) :: t2
    contains
      procedure, nopass :: nondeferred_proc => sub2
    end type t2

  contains
    subroutine sub
      write (*,*) 'Hello.'
    end subroutine sub
    subroutine sub2
      write (*,*) 'Goodbye.'
    end subroutine sub2
  end module undefined

  program p
    use undefined
    class(t), pointer :: x
    call x%nondeferred_proc
  end program p

Is this a valid program?  If not, what restriction of the
standard does it violate?  If so, what does it print.

Note that x%nondeferred_proc does not require the value of x (4.5.7)
and thus is not a reference to x (2.5.6).  Therefore, [83:23-24]
does not prohibit this.

If x were disassociated, its dynamic type would be t and the
interpretation of this would be reasonably clear.

However, the standard does not appear to specify the dynamic type
of x when its association status is undefined.  Nor can I find
any prohibition that applies to this case.

ANSWER:

No, the program is not valid, because the standard does not establish
an interpretation of it.  An edit is supplied to clarify this.

Furthermore, the case with a disassociated pointer was not intended to
be valid.  An edit is supplied to correct this oversight.

DISCUSSION:

Access to object-bound procedures (a.k.a. procedure pointer
components) always require there to be an object.  Access to
type-bound procedures of an object was intended to require this too,
but the effect of the NOPASS attribute on this was overlooked.

KEYWORDS: Type-bound generics
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION 1:

Does the following program unit conform to the 2003 standard?

  module M
    type T
    contains
      procedure MyAdd
      generic :: operator(+) => myAdd
    end type T
    type X
    contains
      procedure, pass(b) :: MyAdd

  contains
    integer function MyAdd ( A, B )
      type(t), intent(in) :: A
      type(x), intent(in) :: B
    end function MyAdd
  end module M

QUESTION 2:

Does the following program unit conform to the 2003 standard?

  module M
    interface operator(+)
      procedure MyAdd
    end interface
    type T

      procedure MyAdd
      generic :: operator(+) => myAdd
    end type T
  contains
    integer function MyAdd ( A, B )
      type(t), intent(in) :: A
      real, intent(in) :: B
    end function MyAdd
  end module M

QUESTION 3:

If the interface block and type definition are exchanged in QUESTION
2, does the program unit conform to the 2003 standard?

ANALYSIS:

The OPERATOR(+) bindings to the types T and X construct a single
generic OPERATOR(+) interface that is a local entity of module M.
They do not construct separate OPERATOR(+) generic interfaces that
are separate local entities of the types.

16.2.3 (Restrictions on generic declarations) specifies that it
"contains the rules that shall be satisfied by every pair of specific
procedures that have the same generic identifier within a scoping
unit."

It is clear that if different functions with identical interfaces
were bound to the types that they would be a "pair of specific
procedures" and the resulting OPERATOR(+) interface would therefore
be prohibited by 16.2.3.

It is not clear whether the generic bindings bind separate specific
procedures to the OPERATOR(+) generic, or only redundantly bind the
same procedure.  If the former, the program units are not standard
conforming because they violate the provisions of 16.2.3.  If the
latter, they appear to be standard conforming.

C1209 (in 12.3.2.1) prohibits a procedure to be bound to a generic
interface more than once in a scoping unit, but only by way of a
PROCEDURE statement in a generic interface block.  There is nothing
obviously equivalent in 4.5.4, nor anything that specifies that C1209
applies to generic bindings to types.  It also does not apply between
a generic interface block and a generic interface previously
specified by a generic binding to a type (question 3), since the
latter specific binding is accomplished by a conspiracy of a
<proc-binding-stmt> and a <generic- binding>, not by a
<procedure-stmt>.

ANSWER:

The program units conform to the 2003 standard.  Multiple bindings of
the same procedure to a generic identifier using a <generic-binding>
in a type definition or by a type definition and a generic interface
block do not bind a "pair of specific procedures" to the generic
interface. Indeed, the following type definition is legal:

  type Z
  contains
    procedure :: MyAdd
    generic :: operator(+) => myAdd, operator(+) => myAdd
  end type Z

QUESTION 1:

Does the following program conform to the 2003 standard?

  program P
    interface X
      subroutine S ( A )
        integer :: A
      end subroutine S
      procedure S
    end interface X
  end program P

ANALYSIS:

16.2.3 (Restrictions on generic declarations) specifies that it
"contains the rules that shall be satisfied by every pair of specific
procedures that have the same generic identifier within a scoping
unit."

It is not clear whether the interface body and the procedure
statement bind separate specific procedures to the generic
identifier, or only redundantly bind the same procedure.  If the
former, the program is not standard conforming because it violates
the provisions of 16.2.3.  If the latter, it appears to be standard
conforming.

C1209 (in 12.3.2.1) prohibits a procedure to be bound to a generic
interface more than once in a scoping unit, but only by way of a
PROCEDURE statement in a generic interface block.

There is a general rule that nothing shall be declared more than
once. It appears that a procedure statement within an interface block
is not a declaration:  5.1.2.6 (External attribute) specifies that
the external attribute may be specified by an EXTERNAL statement, a
<procedure- declaration-stmt> or an interface body that is not in an
abstract interface block.  A procedure statement in an interface
block apparently does not specify the external attribute.  The
procedure specified by the PROCEDURE statement in the above example
is clearly an external procedure with an explicit interface, so it
satisfies the requirements of C1207.

ANSWER:

The program conforms to the 2003 standard.  Multiple bindings of the
same procedure to a generic identifier using an interface body and a
procedure statement do not bind a "pair of specific procedures" to
the generic interface.

Enforcing C1209 is more bother for processors than simply allowing
multiple bindings of a particular specific procedure to a generic
interface.  It is unhelpful to users, and can be hurtful if the
multiple bindings are specified by independent generic interfaces and
brought into a scoping unit by use association from different
modules.  There was no equivalent constraint in Fortran 90, although
something like it was added by interp F90/000007.  The constraint
added there applied only to a single specification part.  It's not
clear whether that meant "declared in the same specification part" or
"accessible in the same specification part."  When it was put into
Fortran 95, it clearly applied to all accessible generic interfaces
with a particular <generic-spec>.  Given the multitude of new ways to
bring specific procedures into a generic interface in Fortran 2003,
and that many of those ways allow a specific procedure to be bound to
a generic identifier more than once, this conspicuously lonely
constraint should be removed.  Edits are supplied to correct this
oversight.

TITLE: Coexistence of IEEE and non-IEEE kinds
KEYWORDS: IEEE, kind
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Is it allowed for a processor to have one or more real kinds for which
there is no IEEE support, while also having real kinds for which there
is IEEE support?

Much of the IEEE material appears to assume that a processor could
simultaneously support both IEEE and non-IEEE kinds.  I thought this
was the intent.  However, the first sentence of the second paragraph
in section 14 says that if IEEE_EXCEPTIONS or IEEE_ARITHMETIC is
accessible in a scoping unit, then IEEE_OVERFLOW and
IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO are supported in the scoping unit for *ALL*
[emphasis mine] kinds of real and complex data.  This says to me
that if there is any kind of real for which the processor cannot
support IEEE_OVERFLOW or IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO, then pretty much none
of the IEEE stuff can be used on that processor at all; there
isn't much of the IEEE stuff that can be used without IEEE_ARITHMETIC
or IEEE_EXCEPTIONS.  This seems draconian and unintended.

I speculate that this condition is intended to apply to all IEEE
real kinds rather than to all real kinds.

ANSWER:

Yes, this is allowed.

The requirement that IEEE_OVERFLOW and IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO be
supported for all kinds of real and complex data within that
scoping unit was intentional.

Support of these two flags means that the exceptions can be detected,
either by a subsequent use of IEEE_GET_FLAG or by program termination
(this is not under program control unless IEEE_SUPPORT_HALTING is true
for those flags).

Whether the flags are supported outside of a routine which uses
IEEE_EXCEPTIONS or IEEE_ARITHMETIC is processor dependent.

EDITS:

None.

What exactly does "whole" mean in this rule?

Specifically, is the following allowed:

REAL, DIMENSION(:), POINTER :: a, b
ALLOCATE(a(1:10))
b=>a(1:10)
DEALLOCATE(b)

ANSWER:

Yes, this is allowed, since "whole" means that b is
ASSOCIATED with all elements of an array that was ALLOCATEd.
In the given example, ASSOCIATED(a,b) is .TRUE., therefore either
a or b can be used to DEALLOCATE the memory.

QUESTION:

Is infinity / 0.0 a divide by zero exception?
Is NaN / 0.0 a divide by zero exception?

Fortran 2003 defines (in 14.2) infinity / zero and NaN / zero
cases as IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO.  IEEE-754 defines (in 6.1 and 6.2)
those two as unexceptional.

ANSWER:

On an IEEE-conformant processor, these cases do not raise exceptions
(see clauses 6.1 and 6.2 of IEEE-754).

The definitions in 14.2 were intended to describe IEEE exceptions with
sufficient latitude to allow use on near-IEEE and non-IEEE machines.
However, the definition of IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO is not consistent with
the IEEE International Standard.

Furthermore, the definition of the IEEE_OVERFLOW flag is also not
consistent with the IEEE standard, because this exception is not
raised for operations on infinite operands.

STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

What is HYPOT(NaN,infinity)? HYPOT(NaN,finite)?

HYPOT(X,Y) when X and/or Y is an infinity (even if the other is
a NaN) shall be +infinity.  Reason: hypot(), when one of the
arguments is an infinity, is +infinity independent of the
value of the other argument.  So, if the NaN argument is
replaced by zero, any finite number, or any infinity,
hypot(infinity,NaN) is still infinity.

HYPOT(X,Y) when X and/or Y is a NaN (and neither is infinite)
shall be a NaN, and should one of the NaN arguments.

ANSWER:

The HYPOT example in note 14.17 illustrates the use of the features
of this section to provide reliable software that is fast in the
uncomplicated case.  We did not consider what would happen if one
of the arguments is a NaN and have therefore edited the text slightly.

DISCUSSION:

In fact, if either X or Y is a NaN, the first executable statement
will set HYPOT to a NaN without signaling an exception. The slower
code in the IF construct will therefore not be executed and a NaN
will be returned, which is consistent with the way NaNs are handled
by intrinsic operators, see paragraph 3 of section 6.2 of the
IEEE International Standard.

13.7 [300:13-15] incorrectly requires an infinite result or a
NaN result to always signal some IEEE exception.

Consider changing [300:13] "infinite result" to "infinite result
(from finite arguments)".  Reason: IEEE-754 mathematical
operations on infinity that produce an infinity are
unexceptional.

Consider changing [300:14] "NaN result" to "NaN result (from
non-NaN arguments)".  Reason: IEEE-754 mathematical operations
on quiet NaN operands that produce a quiet NaN result are
unexceptional.

Consider adding to 13.7 [300:15+] something along the lines of:
"Unless specified otherwise, a math function with NaN
argument(s) shall return a NaN, which should be one of the NaN
arguments."  This allows not having to specify the results for
each specific math function.

Consider adding the above suggested cases to each of the 13.7.*
functions, perhaps, with a bold face IEEE sub-heading.

ANSWER:

The penultimate sentences of 13.7 was intended for the case
where all arguments on entry have normal or denormal values  
and edits are supplied to correct this. 

To specify the results of all the intrinsics for non-normal
values is beyond the scope of an interpretation. Perhaps this 
should be considered for an extension that is adopted for the 
next revision of the standard. Meanwhile, guidance is provided
by the second and third paragraphs of 14.8, which state

"The inquiry function IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN is provided to inquire 
whether the processor supports IEEE NaNs. Where these are supported, 
their behavior for unary and binary operations, including
those defined by intrinsic functions and by functions in intrinsic 
modules, shall be consistent with the specifications in the IEEE
International Standard.

The inquiry function IEEE_SUPPORT_INF is provided to inquire whether 
the processor supports IEEE infinities. Where these are supported, 
their behavior for unary and binary operations, including
those defined by intrinsic functions and by functions in intrinsic 
modules, shall be consistent with the specifications in the IEEE
International Standard. "

arguments are normal or denormal and"

TITLE: Unlimited polymorphic pointers in common blocks
KEYWORDS: Unlimited polymorphic pointer, common block
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

      PROGRAM foo
        COMMON /blk1/ x
        CLASS(*), POINTER :: x
        CALL sub
      END PROGRAM

      SUBROUTINE sub
        COMMON /blk1/ x
        CLASS(*), POINTER :: x
      END SUBROUTINE

There appears to be nothing prohibiting an unlimited polymorphic
pointer from appearing in a common block, but the following appears in
Fortran 2003 at [100:10]:
    A data pointer shall be storage associated only with data pointers
    of the same type and rank.

And at [75:23-25]:
    An object declared with the CLASS(*) specifier is an unlimited
    polymorphic object.  An unlimited polymorphic entity is not
    declared to have a type.  It is not considered to have the same
    declared type as any other entity, including another unlimited
    polymorphic entity.

It appears that it is not standard conforming to have an unlimited
polymorphic pointer that is storage associated with anything else,
including another unlimited polymorphic pointer.  So, while it is
apparently standard-conforming to have an unlimited polymorphic
pointer in a common block, a common block with the same name cannot be
accessed in any other scoping unit.

This interpretation also seems to be supported by parts of section 16
of the standard.

At [416:7-24]:
    In a storage association context
    ...
      (8) A pointer occupies a single unspecified storage unit that is
          different from that of any nonpointer object and is
          different for each combination of type, type parameters, and
          rank.

At [417:12-13]:
    All scoping units that access named common blocks with the same
    name shall specify an identical sequence of storage units.

And at [417:14-17]:
    For any two blank common blocks, the initial sequence of storage
    units of the longer blank common block shall be identical to the
    sequence of storage units of the shorter common block.  If two
    blank common blocks are the same length, they shall have the same
    sequence of storage units.

Was it intended that an unlimited polymorphic pointer should be
allowed in a common block?  If yes, then was it intended that such a
common block should be accessible in more than one scoping unit?

ANSWER:

No.  An edit is provided to correct this oversight.

EDITS:

All edits refer to 04-007.

[98:20]  Before "an allocatable variable", insert
         "a polymorphic pointer,".

TITLE: Polymorphic arguments to intrinsic procedures
KEYWORDS: polymorphism, intrinsic procedures
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

The descriptions of the intrinsic procedures often use the term "type"
without qualification.  It is unclear whether they mean "declared
type" or "dynamic type".  If they mean "dynamic type", then this would
appear to allow unlimited polymorphic arguments to intrinsic
procedures like ABS and SIN.  Resolution of generic intrinsic
procedures in this case would create an undue (and likely unintended)
burden on the processor, and the declared type of the result of such a
function call would be unclear as well.

Question 1:
Are the arguments of the intrinsic functions ALLOCATED, ASSOCIATED,
LBOUND, SHAPE, SIZE, and UBOUND permitted to be polymorphic?

Question 2:
(a) Is the ARRAY argument of the intrinsic function CSHIFT permitted
    to be polymorphic?

Question 3:
(a) Are the ARRAY and BOUNDARY arguments of the intrinsic function
    EOSHIFT permitted to be polymorphic?

    are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 4:
(a) Are the A and MOLD arguments of the intrinsic function
    EXTENDS_TYPE_OF permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on their types refer to their declared types
    or dynamic types?

Question 5:
(a) Are the TSOURCE and FSOURCE arguments of the intrinsic function
    MERGE permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on the types of the arguments refer to their
    declared types or dynamic types?
(d) If either argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 6:
Are the FROM and TO arguments of the intrinsic function MOVE_ALLOC
permitted to be polymorphic?

Question 7:
(a) Are the ARRAY and VECTOR arguments of the intrinsic function PACK
    permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?

(c) Do the requirements on the types of the arguments refer to their
    declared types or dynamic types?
(d) If either argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 9:
(a) Are the A and B arguments of the intrinsic function SAME_TYPE_AS
    permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on their types refer to their declared types
    or dynamic types?

Question 10:
(a) Is the SOURCE argument of the intrinsic function SPREAD permitted
    to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If the argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?  What
    are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 11:
(a) Is the SOURCE argument of the intrinsic function TRANSFER
    permitted to be polymorphic?
(b) Is the MOLD argument of the intrinsic function TRANSFER permitted
    to be polymorphic?
If the answer to (b) is yes:
(c) If the MOLD argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 12:

    permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If the argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?  What
    are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

The intrinsic functions shown in table 13.2 have a polymorphic result
if and only if the specified argument is polymorphic.  Where the
result is specified to have the same type and type parameters as the
argument specified in table 13.2, the result has the same dynamic
type as the specified argument.  If the specified argument is
unlimited polymorphic the result is unlimited polymorphic; otherwise
it has the same declared type as the specified argument.  If another
argument is required to have the same type as the specified argument,
it shall be polymorphic if and only if the specified argument is
polymorphic, and have the same dynamic type as the specified
argument.  If the specified argument is unlimited polymorphic, the
other argument shall also be unlimited polymorphic; otherwise, it
shall have the same declared type as the specified argument.

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

MODULE m

  TYPE t
    INTEGER :: i = 0
  CONTAINS
    PROCEDURE, PRIVATE :: pwf
    GENERIC :: WRITE(FORMATTED) => pwf
  END TYPE

CONTAINS

  RECURSIVE SUBROUTINE pwf(dtv, unit, iotype, vlist, iostat, iomsg)
    CLASS(t),         INTENT(IN)    :: dtv
    INTEGER,          INTENT(IN)    :: unit
    CHARACTER(LEN=*), INTENT(IN)    :: iotype
    INTEGER,          INTENT(IN)    :: vlist(:)
    INTEGER,          INTENT(OUT)   :: iostat
    CHARACTER(LEN=*), INTENT(INOUT) :: iomsg
    WRITE(unit, '(i1, /)') dtv%i
    WRITE(unit, '(t1, a2)') 'AB'
  END SUBROUTINE pwf

END MODULE

PROGRAM foo
  USE m
  IMPLICIT NONE
  TYPE(t) :: a
  a%i = 3
  PRINT *, 'xyz', a
end program

9.5.3.7.2 states:
  A record positioning edit descriptor, such as TL and TR, used on
  unit by a child data transfer statement shall not cause the record
  position to be positioned before the record position at the time the
  user-defined derived-type input/output procedure was invoked.

The term "record position" is used, but it doesn't appear to be
defined anywhere.  Depending on the interpretation, the above program
might be standard-conforming, or it might not be.

If "record position" is taken to mean "the position within the current
record", regardless of which record is the current record, then the
record position at the beginning of the UDDTIO procedure is before the
fourth character of the record.  The first child data transfer
statement begins a new record, and the second child data transfer
statement writes to the first character of the new record.  This would
be before the "record position" at the time the UDDTIO procedure was
invoked, and the program would not be standard-conforming.

If "record position" is taken to mean a combination of the record and
the position within that record (essentially making it mean the same
thing as "file position"), then the above program is standard-
conforming, since the control edit descriptor doesn't cause the file
to be positioned before the record position when the UDDTIO procedure
was invoked.

What is the meaning of "record position", and is the above program
standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

The term "record position" is not well defined.

The intent of 9.5.3.7.2 was to prohibit a child data transfer statement
from possibily overwriting or re-reading any characters in the current
record that an active parent I/O statement had previously written or read.
9.5.3.7.2 should have used the term "file position" instead of
"record position". 

Therefore, the program is standard-conforming, and prints
 xyz.3
AB

where the first record starts with a space and the "." represents 0 or
more spaces.

Edits are supplied to clarify the intent of 9.5.3.7.2, 
add "file position" to the glossary, and remove the phrases
"record position" and "record positioning" from the standard.

EDITS: 

[202:34] In section 9.5.3.7.2, in the paragraph that begins with
    "Because a child data transfer statement does not position the
    file prior to data transfer,"

replace
    "list item or record positioning edit descriptor" 
with
    "list item or edit descriptor" 


[202:36] In section 9.5.3.7.2, replace the phrase
    "A record positioning edit descriptor, such as TL and TR,"
with
    "The edit descriptors T and TL,"

[463:4]  In section C.6.2, first paragraph, delete "record positioning"

[430:4+] In Annex A, add this definition:
  "<<file position>> (9.2.3): A connected unit has a file position.
  A unit's file position typically affects where the next data transfer
  operation will begin transferring data into or out of the file.  The
  file position is usually just before a record, just after a record,
  within a record, just before the first file storage unit in the
  file, just after the last file storage unit in the file, or
  between two adjacent file storage units."

END PROGRAM

10.9.2 of Fortran 2003 states that character sequences produced for
list-directed output are not separated from each other by value
separators when the delimiter mode is NONE.  The implication of this
is obvious when the adjacent effective output list items are both of
character type.  But when user-defined derived-type input/output
is involved, it is much less clear whether a separator should be
included in the output.

In the example given, it is unclear whether the output should be:
 xyz 5 azyx
or:
 xyz 5 a zyx

1. Should a separator be inserted between two non-delimited character
   sequences when one of the character sequences is written by a child
   data transfer statement, and the other is written by a parent data
   transfer statement, where both statements are list-directed?

2. Should a separator be inserted between two non-delimited character
   sequences when the character sequences are written by two different
   child data transfer statements, where both statements are
   list-directed?

3. Should a separator be inserted between two character sequences when
   one of the character sequences is written by a child data transfer
   statement, and the other is written by a parent data transfer
   statement, where one of the statements is list-directed and the
   other is format-directed?

4. Should a separator be inserted between two character sequences when
   the character sequences are written by two different child data
   transfer statements, where one of the statements is list-directed
   and the other is format-directed?

ANSWER:

1) No. It is the intent of the standard (10.9.2) that when both the
   parent and child data transfer statements are both list-directed
   output statements, or both are namelist output statements, the
   processor treats the first list item appearing in a child data
   transfer statement as if that list item had immediately
   followed the last list item processed by the parent data
   transfer statement, as long as no other data transfers to that
   unit occurred in between the processing of those two list items.
   Therefore, in this case, the two character sequences are
   considered adjacent.

2) No. It is the intent of the standard (10.9.2) that when two
   different child data transfer statements are both list-directed
   output statements, or both namelist output statements, they write
   to the same unit, and no other data transfers to that unit occur
   in between the two child data transfer statements, the processor
   treats the first list item appearing in the second child data
   transfer statement as if that list item had immediately followed
   the last list item processed by the first child data transfer
   statement.  Therefore, in this case, the two character sequences
   are considered adjacent.

3) It is processor dependent whether or not a separator appears
   between two such character sequences.  In section 10.9.2, the
   phrase "adjacent undelimited character sequences" refers to
   character sequences produced by list-directed output.  When one of
   the sequences is written by a child or parent output statement
   that is not list-directed, the exception described in the first
   paragraph of 10.9.2 does not apply. The other rules for inserting
   optional blanks around values in list-directed output allow the
   processor to insert optional leading and trailing blanks around a
   list item.  The standard does not specify when optional blanks are
   written; therefore, when two adjacent list items (the values
   thereof) are written to an output record, and only one of them was
   written by list-directed input/output, the standard does not specify
   whether or not any optional blanks appear between those values in
   the output record.

4) It is processor dependent whether or not a separator appears
   between two such character sequences.  See answer 3.

EDITS: 

[241:5+] In Section 10.9.2, add the following to the end of the
         first paragraph:
  "Two undelimited character sequences are considered adjacent when
   both were written using list-directed input/output, no intervening
   data transfer or input/output file positioning operations occurred,
   and both were written either by a single data transfer statement,
   or during the execution of a parent data transfer statement along
   with its child data transfer statements."

DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTIONS:

Question 1:

Fortran 2003 does not seem to prohibit this kind of recursive internal
input/output.  Was this program intended to be standard-conforming?
If so, then what does the program print?

MODULE m1
  CHARACTER(20) :: ifile = ''
CONTAINS
  CHARACTER(3) FUNCTION foo()

  PRINT *, ifile
END PROGRAM

Question 2:

Fortran 2003 does not seem to prohibit this kind of recursive internal
Iinput/output.  Was this program intended to be standard-conforming?
If so, then what does the program print?

END PROGRAM

Question 3:

Fortran 2003 does not appear to prohibit modifying a character
variable when it is being used as an internal file in a data transfer
statement that is currently executing.  Was this program intended to
be standard-conforming?  If so, then what does the program print?

Question 4:

Fortran 2003 does not appear to prohibit referencing a character
variable when it is being used as an internal file in a data transfer
statement that is currently executing.  Was this program intended to
be standard-conforming?  If so, then what does the program print?

ANSWER:

All of these examples were intended to be prohibited.  
Edits are provided to prohibit referencing or defining a variable used
as an internal unit as a result of evaluating any output list items, or
transferring values to any input list item.

EDITS:

In section 9.5.3.4, after the paragraph:
    "If an internal file has been specified, an input/output list item
    shall not be in the file or associated with the file."
    
add these paragraphs [196:29+]:

  "During the execution of an output statement that specifies an
  internal file, no part of that internal file shall be referenced,
  defined, or become undefined as the result of evaluating any output
  list item. 
  
  During the execution of an input statement that specifies an
  internal file, no part of that internal file shall be defined or
  become undefined as the result of transferring a value to any
  input list item."

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

MODULE m

  TYPE t
    INTEGER :: i
    INTEGER :: j
  END TYPE

  INTEGER :: ipos

  INTERFACE READ(FORMATTED)
    MODULE PROCEDURE formattedReadT
  END INTERFACE

CONTAINS

  SUBROUTINE formattedReadT (dtv, unit, iotype, vlist, iostat, iomsg)
    CLASS(T), INTENT(INOUT) :: dtv
    INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: unit
    CHARACTER(*), INTENT(IN) :: iotype
    INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: vlist(:)
    INTEGER, INTENT(OUT) :: iostat
    CHARACTER(*), INTENT(INOUT) :: iomsg

    READ(unit, *) dtv%i
    INQUIRE(unit, POS=ipos)
    READ(unit, *) dtv%j

END MODULE

PROGRAM foo
  USE m
  TYPE(t) :: a
  OPEN(10, FILE='file.txt', ACCESS='stream', FORM='formatted')
  WRITE(10, '(A)') '2*3 5'
  REWIND(10)
  READ(10, *) a
  PRINT *, a%i, a%j, ipos
END PROGRAM

10.9 of Fortran 2003 states that the r*c form of list-directed input
is equivalent to r occurrences of c.  So, when the read is performed,
it is as if the input record contains two occurrences of the number 3.

The first child read statement reads the first 3, and does not advance
the file position to the next record (because it is a child data
transfer statement).  It appears that the second read statement should
read the second 3.  But the file position between the child read
statements is unclear.

What does the above program print?

ANSWER:

The standard does not specify the behavior of a processor when a list
directed input record contains a r*c constant, and that entire set
of input values is not completely consumed by one list directed
input statement. In particular, the file position for such an input
file when the processor is in the middle of consuming an r*c value,
and a child input statement is invoked, is not defined.  This was an
oversight.  Edits are supplied to prohibit r*c constants in this
case.  The above program is not standard conforming.

EDITS:

[239:18-] Insert this paragraph just after note 10.28:
    "When the first value of an <r*c> constant is transferred to a list
    item by a list-directed input statement, that input statement shall
    transfer all <r> values of that <r*c> constant to list items before
    causing any child input statement to be invoked.  If that
    list-directed input statement is itself a child input
    statement, it shall transfer all <r> values of that <r*c> constant
    to list items before terminating."

TITLE: The BIND attribute for C_PTR and C_FUNPTR
KEYWORDS: BIND attribute, C_PTR, C_FUNPTR, private components
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

1. Do the derived types C_PTR and C_FUNPTR have the BIND
attribute?

This affects whether an object of one of these types is permitted
directly in COMMON.  C589, p. 98 states "If a common-block-object is
of a derived type, it shall be a sequence type (4.5.1) or a
type with the BIND attribute and it shall have no default
initialization."

It also affects whether the types are extensible. 4.5.6 states
"A nonsequence derived type that does not have the BIND attribute is
an extensible type."

2. 15.2.2 states that C_PTR and C_FUNPTR are derived types with
private components. Are user-defined derived types with the BIND
attribute permitted to have private components?

ANSWER:

1. Yes, it was intended that these types have the BIND attribute.
An edit makes this clear.

2. A user-defined derived type with the BIND attribute is permitted
to have private components.

DISCUSSION:

1. It was intended that the behaviour of these types be similar to
that of user-declared derived types in all respects except that
they interoperate with C pointer types rather than C struct types.
As well as the two cases cited in the question, there are special
conditions in a pointer assignment statement (7.4.2) if either the
pointer or the target has the BIND attribute. Also, there is a
restriction on types with the BIND attribute in a SELECT TYPE
statement (8.1.5).

2. The rules for the interoperability of a C struct type with a
Fortran derived type are less restrictive than the rules in
4.5.1.3 that determine whether two separately declared Fortran
types, both with the BIND attribute, are the same. For the types
to be the same, the names of corresponding components must agree and
all components must be public. It follows that two types may be
different although they both interoperate with the same C struct
type.

EDITS:

Page and line numbers refer to 04-007.

[397:3] Subclause 15.2.2. At the end of the first paragraph add
"Each has the BIND attribute but is not interoperable with any C
struct type."

It is clear that procedure pointers are permitted in common blocks.
However, due to the restrictions on BLOCK DATA program units, it seems
that such a common block can not appear in a BLOCK DATA program unit.

Was it intended that common blocks containing procedure pointers could
be initialized in a BLOCK DATA program unit?

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

      PROGRAM foo
        PROCEDURE(sub) :: p
        INTERFACE
          SUBROUTINE sub(p2)
            IMPORT p
            PROCEDURE(p) :: p2
          END SUBROUTINE
        END INTERFACE
      END PROGRAM

C1212 appears to prohibit the case of an interface name in a procedure
declaration statement being the name of something declared in a later
procedure declaration statement.  But it does not appear to prohibit
the case of an interface name being the name of something declared in
a later interface body.

In the above program, the characteristics of p rely on the
characteristics of sub.  The characteristics of sub, in turn, rely on
the characteristics of p.

Is this program standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

No, this program is not standard-conforming.  The interface name in a
procedure declaration statement should not be permitted to be declared
in a later interface body.  An edit is supplied to correct this

Given
  REAL X
  X = ... some value ...
may

  IF( X .EQ. 0.0 )...
by the processor?

References are to J3/04-007.

7.1.8.3 Evaluation of numeric intrinsic operations has a discussion of
"mathematically equivalent", "mathematical value" and "computational
results".

7.1.8.5 Evaluation of relational intrinsic operations has "Two
relational intrinsic operations are relationally equivalent if their
logical values are equal for all possible values of their primaries."

"values" in that context is ambiguous to me.  Is it the infinite set
of mathematical values or is it the finite set of hardware
representable (computational) values?

My brief scan of F2003 finds that "values" without any adjectives
means what the hardware can represent.

Assuming "values" in 7.1.8.5 means what the hardware can represent,
then I conclude that the transformation cannot be done.  However, Note
7.22 shows "I > J" transformed into "J-I < 0"; which is not true for
the finite set of hardware values (due to undefined behavior of
overflow), but is true for the infinite set of mathematical values.

I believe that "possible values" should be changed to either:
  possible mathematical values 
or
  possible computational values

TITLE: Subroutine/function ambiguity in generics
KEYWORDS: subroutine, generic, implicit
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

 Q1. Is the following generic allowed?
 
     interface q
       subroutine qr(f)
         implicit real(f)
         external f
       end subroutine
       subroutine qc(f)
         implicit complex(f)
         external f
       end subroutine
     end interface q

     The uncertainly arises because it is not established
     whether F is a subroutine or a function. If either F
     were a subroutine, then it would be clear that the
     generic was disallowed. One might be able to use this
     to deduce that both Fs must be functions. This seems
     like an obscure deduction to demand of the compiler.

 Q2. Consider the following "obviously" allowed generic
 
     module m
       interface q
         subroutine qr(f)
           real, external :: f
         end subroutine
         subroutine qc(f)
           complex, external :: f
         end subroutine
       end interface q
     end module m

     Is the following main program valid?
    
     program main
       use m
       external ff
       call q(ff)
     end
     
     Again, the problem is that it is unclear whether of not
     ff is a function or subroutine. If it is a subroutine,
     then the call is ambiguous. One might thus deduce that
     ff must be a function, and therefore of type real,
     but this seems like an obscure deduction to demand of
     the compiler.

ANSWER:

 I'm not sure. But presumably either the compiler is required
 to make the mentioned deductions or the code must be
 nonconforming. If the code is intended to be nonconforming,
 edits to say so might be needed.

Item (5) in the list in section 15.2.6 seems to have been written with
only data objects in mind, and it is not clear whether it applies to
dummy procedures. I quote it here:

(5) any dummy argument without the VALUE attribute corresponds to a 
formal parameter of the prototype that is of a pointer type, and the 
dummy argument is interoperable with an entity of the referenced  type
(C International Standard, 6.2.5, 7.17, and 7.18.1) of the  formal
parameter;

We believe that the intention is that dummy procedures be included, and
that this text should be revised accordingly.

EDITS:

In item (5) in the list in section 15.2.6, replace "any dummy argument
without the VALUE attribute" with "any dummy argument that is not a
procedure and does not have the VALUE attribute" and replace "pointer
type" with "object pointer type".

and add a new item (5+) to the list:

(5+) any dummy procedure argument corresponds to a formal parameter of
the prototype that is of function pointer type, and the dummy procedure
is interoperable with a function of the referenced type of the formal

Is the following conforming:

   interface
      subroutine CProc() bind(C,name="AnExternalCProcedure")
      end subroutine

module B
   interface
      subroutine CSub() bind(C,name="AnExternalCProcedure")
      end subroutine
   end interface   
end module

ANSWER:

The standard's current wording is such that this is not conforming. The
name of an external procedure is a global entity and it is unique to a
given procedure. That is, the external C procedure AnExternalCProcedure,
must be given a unique Fortran name inside a Fortran program.

However, the question is whether this was intended or whether it
happened by virtue of improper integration of binding labels (which
should be global entities, rather than the Fortran name) with the
existing words for Fortran external procedures (which have only one
name, the Fortran name, and therefore it should be global). Forbidding
examples like tone one above violate basic principles of modularity and
introduce global entities without justification. The Fortran names given
to the external C procedure AnExternalCProcedure should be local to the
scopes of modules A and B respectively, not of global scope. 

Correcting this problem may be done in the next revision of the
standard, if it is deemed that the answer to this Interp ought to be
yes.

QUESTION:

   What is the result of this program:

   PROGRAM
      TYPE :: t
         REAL :: x
      END TYPE

      TYPE(t) :: y(-5:5)

      WRITE(*,*) LBOUND(y%x), LBOUND(y(3:5)%x)

   END PROGRAM

ANSWER:

Option 1) The program prints "1 1"

Option 2) The program prints "-5 1"

Note: There are compilers on both side of the spectrum, though it seems
the majority print "1 1". I believe the intended answer is "1 1".

Discussion:

The definition of LBOUND:

"If ARRAY is a whole array or array structure component and either
ARRAY  is an assumed-size array of rank DIM or dimension DIM of ARRAY
has  nonzero extent, LBOUND (ARRAY, DIM) has a value equal to the lower
bound for subscript DIM of ARRAY. Otherwise the result value is 1."

uses the phrase "array structure component", which can be read as
"structure component that is an array" (which y%x and y(3:5)%x are), or
"array component of a structure" (which neither y%x and y(3:5)%x are).
The first reading says that the answer is equal to the lower bound of
y%x, but the standard does not actually specify what the lower bounds of
array sections are (since they cannot be subscripted). The second
reading says that the answer is "1 1", and I believe it is the intended
one.

EDITS:

Either:

1) Modify the words for LBOUND to say something alike "array component
of a scalar of derived type" instead of "array structure component", or

2) Make an array component of a scalar of derived type be a "whole
array" (this may have other consequences, but seems more intuitive than
just tweaking the definition of LBOUND).

Possibly also rewrite NOTE 6.6 to make it explicitly clear that
something can be both a component and a section (assuming this is the
intention), for example, add the sentence: "Some forms of <data-ref> are
both a structure component and an array section."

QUESTION:

Does the function IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE
(Section 14.8) override the mathematical
equivalence rule (Section 7.1.8.3)?

For example, could the program

PROGRAM MAIN
USE, INTRINSIC :: IEEE_ARITHMETIC
USE, INTRINSIC :: IEEE_FEATURES
X = 2.0 + 2.0
PRINT *, X
END

USE, INTRINSIC :: IEEE_FEATURES
X = 220.0*(1.0/55.0)
PRINT *, X
END

if IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE(X) is .TRUE.?

Background:

The committee recently ruled that 2.0 + 2.0 must produce
the value 4.0 if IEEE_ARITHMETIC is in effect. I agree
that if the particular operation the processor implements
is addition of 2.0 and 2.0, the result must be 4.0.
However, if IEEE_ARITHMETIC does not override the
mathematical equivalence rule, the requirement is essentially
meaningless, since there is no assurance that the expression
in the program is the expression that will be evaluated.

QUESTION:

     In formatted output, what is the value of the

     under the D, E, EN, ES, and G edit descriptors?

SUGGESTED ANSWER:

     In such a case, the decimal exponent should have

DISCUSSION:

The Fortran 2003 standard does not specify what the value
of the decimal exponent of a real zero value should be
under formatted output.  Every implementation of which Sun
is aware uses the value zero for the decimal exponent
unless a nonzero scale factor is in effect.  As a member
of the committee has pointed out, different
implementations format real zeros differently under
nonzero scale factors.

The C and C++ standards both explicitly state that the
value of the decimal exponent produced for the real value
zero under a format that includes an exponent is zero.
The Fortran standard should also.

QUESTION:

     Suppose a Fortran processor's representation of
     the real zero value is signed.  When a negative
     real zero value is written using formatted output:

     (a)  Does the Fortran 2003 standard allow the
          representation of the zero value in the
          output field to be prefixed with a minus
          sign?

     (b)  Does the Fortran 2003 standard require the
          representation of the zero value in the
          output field to be prefixed with a minus
          sign?

ANSWER:
     (a)  Yes.  Although Section 4.4.2 lists some
          contexts as requiring positive and negative zeros to
          be treated as equivalent, formatted output is not
          on that list of contexts.  Negative zero can already
          be produced by formatted output, for example by

                PRINT '(F4.1)', -0.000001

          which in Fortran 95 (but not Fortran 90) is required
          to write "-0.0" or " -.0".

     (b)  Yes, or Not Necessarily (edits provided for both).  The
          first choice promotes portability.

          (b1) The negative sign is required to appear in
               formatted output of a negative zero value.

          (b2) Negative zero values may be treated as negative
               values in formatted output at the option of the
               implementor.

DISCUSSION:

     A negative zero value is negative by name but zero
     by nature.  Therefore a context which refers to negative
     values must always be inspected to see if it is appropriate
     to also include negative zero values, and the instance in
     10.6.1 needs amendment.

TITLE: Interpretation request concerning DATA

DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Withdrawn by submitter

QUESTION:

Does the following program unit conform to the 2003 Fortran standard?

  subroutine S ( N )

    character(3) :: c(2)

    data ( c(i)(n:n), i = 1, 2 ) / 'A', 'B' /

  end subroutine s

ANSWER:

No.

A <data-i-do-object> is required to be an <array-element> or a
<structure-component> (see R528 [87:31-32]).

An <array-element> is only a <data-ref> with some extra constraints
(see R616 [107:10]).

A <data-ref> ends with a <part-ref> and does not include a
<substring-range> (see R612 and R613, [105:1-2]).

Therefore c(i)(n:n) is not an array element.
Similarly, a <structure-component> is a <data-ref>, and therefore
c(i)(n:n) is not a structure component either.

Therefore there is a syntax error in the third line of the program unit.

STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Section 7.1.8.1 says that if the value of an
expression can be determined before execution
of the program, it is standard-conforming to use
the predetermined value.

Consider the subprogram

        SUBROUTINE S()
        USE, INTRINSIC :: IEEE_ARITHMETIC
        USE, INTRINSIC :: IEEE_FEATURES

        INTEGER, PARAMETER :: sp = IEEE_SELECTED_REAL_KIND(6,30)
        real(sp) :: X = 0.5559013_sp
        real(sp) :: Y = 1.2092481_sp
        real(sp) :: Z
        IF (IEEE_SUPPORT_ROUNDING(IEEE_NEAREST,X) .AND. &
            IEEE_SUPPORT_ROUNDING(IEEE_UP,X)) THEN
            Z1 = X*Y
            CALL IEEE_SET_ROUNDING_MODE(IEEE_NEAREST)
            Z2 = X*Y
            PRINT *, 'Residual: ', Z1 - Z2
        ENDIF
        END

(1) Is a processor permitted always to print zero for the residual Z1 - Z2 ?
(2) Same question, after giving X and Y the PARAMETER attribute.

ANSWER:

(1) No, for a high quality implementation.  
Given that the processor supports execution with both
rounding modes IEEE_NEAREST and IEEE_UP, this subprogram
might be executed in either rounding mode (since the rounding
mode is inherited from the caller, see [367:20-22]), and the value
zero is a bad approximation in the latter case.

No edits are necessary.

(2) Yes.  In this case "X*Y" is an initialization expression,  whose value does
not change from one appearance to the next. 

EDITS:

Note 14.6 should note additionally that the value of an
initialization expression is not affected by changes in the rounding mode.

Is the target of TV finalized with SUB is invoked?

If TV were allocatable instead of a pointer would it be finalized?

It was intended that an allocatable actual argument or the target of a

 effect for sub_c without violating the syntactic constraint.
 
   elemental subroutine sub(x)
     entry sub_c(x) bind(c)

 No, it is not allowed. Constraint C1242 was intended to disallow
 the combination of elemental and BIND(C), but it inadvertently
 failed to cover the case shown in the above example.

It seems that constraint C1255 in subclause 12.5.2.4 [283:10-12] prohibits
the entry name A to appear in the PROCEDURE statement in the interface
body.  There shouldn't be a problem, however, since the PROCEDURE
statement is in a different scoping unit.

REMARK:

There is no constraint parallel to C1255 concerning the <subroutine-name>
in a SUBROUTINE statement, and only an indirect one (C1235 in subclause
12.5.2.1 [279:24-25]) concerning the <function-name> in a FUNCTION
statement, and only then if the FUNCTION statement has a RESULT clause.
Subclauses 16.1 and 16.2 adequately cover the problems that constraint
C1255 appears to have been intended to cover.

It was not intended that this usage be prohibited.  An edit is provided to

INTRODUCTION

Subclause 15.2.3 of 04-007 says [398:9-12]:

  "A Fortran derived type is interoperable with a C struct type if the
   derived-type definition of the Fortran type specifies BIND(C) (4.5.1),
   the Fortran derived type and the C struct type have the same number of
   components, and the components of the Fortran derived type have types
   and type parameters that are interoperable with the types of the
   corresponding components of the struct type."

QUESTIONS

  1. Is a Fortran derived type for which BIND(C) is not specified
     interoperable with any C struct type?

  2. Does a Fortran derived type interoperate with a C struct type that
     has a different number of components?

  3. Does a Fortran derived type interoperate with a C struct type that
     specifies the same components in a different order?

  4. Does a Fortran derived type with a pointer or allocatable component
     that has interoperable type and type parameters interoperate with
     any C struct type?

According to the rules of procedure pointer assignment at [144:39-41],
proc_ptr and proc_tgt are required to have the same interface
characteristics.  However because an unlimited polymorphic entity is
not considered to have a declared type, the rules for characteristics
of dummy data objects [256:26-32] and characteristics of function
results [257:2-8] are not applicable. In addition, rules at [145:5-6]

This also does not apply to unlimited polymorphic data.

Yes, the example was intended to be standard-conforming.
An edit is provided to clarify this.

The characteristics however are adequately defined.  FOO, and thus

QUESTION:

Consider

    CHARACTER(:), ALLOCATABLE :: str(:)
    ALLOCATE (CHARACTER(1) :: str(0:9))
    str = 'reallocate?'

According to the third paragraph of 7.4.1.3, the variable STR should
be deallocated on this assignment because it has a deferred length
type parameter different from the <expr> ('reallocate?'); it should
then be allocated with its length type parameter the same as that of
the <expr> and with the shape and bounds of <expr>.  But the STR
cannot be allocated with the shape and bounds of the <expr> since it
is a scalar.

The standard, however, provides a possible interpretation for the
shape of <expr> two paragraphs later where it says
  "If <expr> is a scalar and <variable> is an array, the <expr> is
   treated as if it were an array of the same shape as <variable>
   with every element of the array equal to the scalar value of
   <expr>."

Q(1). Should the variable STR be reallocated in this case?

Q(2). If so, what are the values of its length type parameter, shape
      and bounds?

ANSWER:

(1) Yes, STR should be reallocated - that is the purpose of the
    combination of ALLOCATABLE and deferred type parameters.  If
    the user does not wish for automatic reallocation he can use
    "str(:) = 'do not reallocate'" instead.

(2) The length parameter of str after the assignment is 11 (the value
    returned by LEN('reallocate?')).  The shape and bounds should be
    unchanged.  An edit is provided to clarify this.

Note that the standard does not forbid, but does not specify semantics
for,
  str = 'oops'
when STR is an unallocated array with a deferred length parameter.
An edit is supplied to make it clear that this is not allowed.

Note also that this applies to parameterized derived types with
deferred type parameters.

Case (v) of intrinsic inquiry function ASSOCIATED [305:5-9] says

      if the target associated with POINTER and TARGET have the same

      zero-sized storage sequences, and occupy the same storage units
      in array element order. Otherwise, the result is false. If
      POINTER is disassociated, the result is false.

This will cause the intrinsic to return false if the POINTER is
pointer assigned to the TARGET with bounds-remapping (POINTER and
TARGET can be of different ranks).  The same issue also exists for
case (vii).

Is the POINTER associated with the TARGET if the POINTER is pointer
assigned to the TARGET with bounds-remapping?

ANSWER:

No, it is not intended that ASSOCIATED(POINTER, TARGET) return true
after pointer assignment using a bounds-remapping that changes the
shape or rank.  This was a conscious decision made in response to a
Fortran 90 interpretation request concerning dummy arguments that
are different shaped versions of the same array in the calling

QUESTION:

Is it allowed to change the value of a variable which supplies the
unit number to an read statement?

Page 219:16 says the value of any input/output specifier shall not
depend on any input-item.  If you trace back, the unit= is a specifier
in a READ statement.

Note 9.40 on page 196 gives the example

         READ(N)  N, X(N)

and discusses how the changes in N work.

In F77 the similar example had READ(3).

In Fortran 90 this was changed to READ(N) (on page 126) and was
normative.

In F95 the example was changed to a non-normative note.

The words prohibiting the example usage appear to be new to F03.

ANSWER:

Yes, the example was intended to be allowed.  The restriction on
page 219 is overly restrictive.  Edits will limit the restriction
to "output items" in the specifier list and the Format.  These are
the items that the processor will usually reference during actual
input/output transfers.

directed value separators.  Page 239:7 says those value separators
are "...blanks between values" and then defines what the values are.
The "J" above isn't a value, so the blanks aren't separators and the
fragment is illegal for namelist input

2)  Is there a similar problem with namelist comments as in this
fragment?
              I = 3           !  this is a namelist comment

ANSWER:

1)  Yes, it was intended to allow blanks as separators for namelist
input.  Edits are supplied to correct the wording in the standard

2)  Yes, there is a similar problem with comments.  The fragment is 
intended to be legal.  The edits correct the error.

EDITS:

[243:5] Replace the paragraph by
  "A value separator for list-directed formatting (10.9) is also a
   value separator for namelist formatting.  In addition, one or
   more contiguous blanks between a nonblank value and the following
   object designator or "!" comment initiator is a value separator."

TITLE: Does allocate with source= define subcomponents?
KEYWORDS: allocate, source, define
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Was it intended that an allocate with a source= clause define
subcomponents?

Bullet 11 on 422 says "Successful execution of an allocate STATEMENT
...causes the subcomponent to become undefined."

ANSWER:

An Allocate with a SOURCE= specifier was intended to define
subcomponents.

In fact, none of the lists in clause 16 account for a SOURCE=
specifier.  Edits are supplied to clarify this.

EDITS:

[113:21]  At the end of the last sentence in 6.3.1.1 insert
"unless they are defined by a SOURCE= specifier"

[421:27-28] 16.5.6, list item 19, modify by adding after
       "Allocation of an object", "except by an ALLOCATE statement
       with a SOURCE= specifier".

[421:28+] 16.5.6, insert new list item after (19)
      "(19a) Successful execution of an ALLOCATE statement with a
             SOURCE= specifier causes a subobject of the allocated
             object to become defined if the corresponding subobject
             of the SOURCE= expression is defined."

[422:41]  16.5.6, list item (11) insert "with no SOURCE= specifier"
      after "ALLOCATE statement"

[422:43+]  16.5.6, add a new list item after (11),
      "(11a) Successful execution of an ALLOCATE statement with a
             SOURCE= specifier causes a subobject of the allocated
             object to become undefined if the corresponding
             subobject of the SOURCE= expression is undefined."

TITLE: Clause 16 does not account for volatile variable
KEYWORDS: volatile, defined, undefined
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Should the various lists in clause 16 that describe definition and
association be modified to include the effects of volatile variables?

In particular, 16.4.2.1.1 through 16.4.2.1.2 do not mention the fact
that pointer association status can be volatile and change by other
means.

16.5.4 says "all other variables are initially undefined.?  Can a
volatile variable be initially defined by other means?

16.5 (26) says volatile variables "become defined", but they also can
become undefined, by other means.

Allocatable volatile variables can become allocated or unallocated by
other means also.

ANSWER:

Yes, the lists in clause 16 should be modified to include the effects
of volatility.  In addition, the effects of volatile on pointer
objects are not completely specified in clause 5.  The effect on
allocatable objects is not complete in clause 6.

EDITS:

[85:10] In the paragraph between note 5.21 and note 5.22, change 
"association status and array bounds" to "association status, dynamic 
type and type parameters, and array bounds"

[113:21+]  Add a new paragraph at the end of 6.3.1.1
"The allocation status of an object with the VOLATILE attribute may 
change by means not specified by the program."

[415:27]  Add a new paragraph at the end of 16.4.2.1.4
"When a pointer object with the VOLATILE attribute is changed by a
means not specified by the program it may become defined or undefined.
In addition, its array bounds and association status may change.  If
it is polymorphic, its dynamic type and type parameters may change."

[421:42-43] 16.5.5 Replace list item (26) with text, not a list item 
"In addition, an object with the VOLATILE attribute (5.1.2.16) might
become defined by a means not specified by the program."

[423:28+]  16.5.6 insert as text after the last list item
"In addition, an object with the VOLATILE attribute (5.1.2.16) might
become undefined by a means not specified by the program."

TITLE: Error in field width for special cases of signed INFINITY output
KEYWORDS: formatted output, signed infinity
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Is there an error in the description for the output of a IEEE infinity
with a sign and a field width of 3 or 8?

228:36-37 describes the output for an IEEE infinity and special cases
field widths of 3 and 8.  But, the special casing doesn't consider the
possibility of a plus or minus sign in the field.  A signed infinity
should be special cased for field widths of 9 and 4.

ANSWER:

Yes, there is an error in the special cases.  Edits are provided to
correctly describe the required field widths for signed infinities.

EDITS:

[228:36-37]  In the paragraph beginning "For an internal value that is
an IEEE infinity." in 10.6.1.2.1 change "If <w> is less than 3" to 
"If no sign is produced and <w> is less than 3".  

Add after that sentence:
"If a sign is produced and <w> is less than 4, the field is filled
with asterisks; otherwise, if <w> is less than 9, the sign followed
by 'Inf' is produced. "

TITLE: Is UDDTIO output suitable for namelist and list-directed input
KEYWORDS:UDDTIO, list-directed I/O, namelist I/O
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

The first paragraph of 10.9.2 says that the form of the values 
produced by list-directed output is the same as that required for 
input.  It also says values are separated blanks or commas, etc.

The first paragraph of 10.10.2 has similar words for namelist output.
It also requires that the variable name be produced in upper case and 
that the output consist of name-value pairs.

Is it intended that output produced by used defined derived type 
routines conform to these rules?

ANSWER:

No, it was not intended to constrain the user derived type output 
values.  There should be an exception similar to the one for adjacent 
un-delimited character values.  User derived type output fields do not 
need to be readable by either namelist nor list-directed input

EDITS:

[241:5]  Add at the end of the paragraph
"The form of the output produced by a used-defined derived type output
routine invoked during list-directed output is specified by the 
invoked routine.  It need not be compatible with list-directed input
or output."

[246:4]  After "and logical values" add ", and output produced by 
user-defined derived type output"

[246:7]  Add at the end of the paragraph
"The form of the output produced by a used-defined derived type output
routine invoked during namelist output is specified by the 
invoked routine.  It need not be compatible with namelist input
or output."
