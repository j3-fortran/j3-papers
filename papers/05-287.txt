1. Monday, November 7, 2005  8:00 am
-------------------------------------

    The meeting (#174) was called to order at 8:00 AM, Monday, November
    7, 2005, at the Las Vegas Emerald Suites by the chair, Dan
    Nagle.

1.1 Opening business                              D. Nagle

1.1.1 Remarks from the chair                      D. Nagle

    Dan completed officer training.
 
    INCITS is getting very strict about getting the assessment in
    on time.  They will probably get results to Dan in January,
    before the February meeting.

1.1.2 Adoption of agenda                          D. Nagle

**  motion: Adopt the agenda (moved by R. Hendrickson/seconded by
            M. Ingrassia): passed by unanimous consent {uc}

    There may be a speaker on co-arrays Wednesday; details to be
    worked out.

    The final agenda is in Appendix A

1.1.3 Approval of Meeting 173 minutes             D. Nagle

**  motion: Approve meeting #173 minutes, paper J3/05-259 
            (Snyder/Hendrickson): uc 

1.1.4 INCITS/OMC report (if any)                  D. Nagle

    We and WG5 had several complaints about the previous draft
    processing by ISO.  We now have a copy of the ISO rules.  We
    can propose changes to those rules and INCITS will bring them
    up with ISO.  We should talk to Malcolm about proposed
    editorial method changes.  We can't retroactively change
    F2003, for example, to put the hot links back.

1.1.5 ISO/WG5 report                              Van Snyder, IR

    None

    [There will be a tag meeting Thursday to select official
     delegates for joint J3/WG5 meeting.]

1.1.6 J11 Liaison report (if any)                 C. Rasmussen

    Craig forwarded on to us responses from C library people about
    the libm functions.  There is a paper with C interop details.

1.1.7 H2 Liaison report (if any)                  D. Nagle

    Main activity is with SQL/HML interface, appears to be near
    having something that will go beyond the technical committee.

1.1.8 IEEE 754 report (if any)                    M. Ingrassia

    Seems to be a pause in finishing decimal arithmetic.  There is
    an Oct. 20 draft and a few competing formats.  They must deal
    with Fortran Java, etc.  Should they specify a bit-wise encoding
    for (packed) decimal or leave it to the hardware?

    They are also cleaning up denormals, signaling NaN, rounding,
    MAX(NaN, Inf...), etc. in IEEE floating point.  They are trying
    to go to "language defined", as well as "implementation defined",
    so that, for example, all Fortran compilers must do things the
    same way, but COBOL could be different.  

    There appear to be significant splits in the committee with
    possible delays in getting the work done.

1.1.9 Treasurer's report                          M. North

    Opening balance:  $2604.24
    Meeting fee  $50

**   motion: Exempt Chisholm and Donev from meeting fee
             (North/Rasmussen) uc

**   motion: Waive meeting fee for meeting 175, reinstate for
             meeting 176 (North/Ingrassia) uc

1.1.11 Local arrangements                         M. North

    Discussed, but not noted for minutes

    We have contracts for Emerald Suites for May, Aug, and Nov
    2006

    Do we want to meet somewhere else for the Aug meeting to beat
    the heat?  Van suggests Cabo San Lucas(sp?) in Baja, Mexico.
    Large resort, swimming pool, etc.  Room rate would be $69 which
    includes meals at most of the hotel restaurants.  Meeting room
    is big enough for us and free with 10 sleeping rooms.  Probably
    no internet in the sleeping rooms.

1.1.12 Comments from members

    M. Ingrassia reports that the DWARF committee needs volunteers
    to help with Fortran.  DWARF is a standardized debugger and other
    tools interface.

    Dan:  Social event for meeting 175, joint with WG5 at George Mason
    University, we will go to the Air and Space Museum, tours start at
    1:00PM.  We'll probably rent a bus to go out there around noon, get
    Deli sandwiches for lunch on the bus, do the tour, get back to the
    University for an hour or two of meetings, and then do the group
    supper after the tour.

    We have a contract for the Fairfax meeting in February.  Details in
    the announcement Dan set out.  Comfort Inn in Fairfax.

    Brief discussion of what to do for the joint meeting.  Should we
    review the items that weren't discussed or finalized at Delft?
    They are the small things on the JKR scale.  Will try to consider
    things later in the week.

    Mallory's comments on the memory stick.  There is a how to folder
    with info about how to connect, etc.  Folder m173 is from last
    meeting, m174 has the pre-meeting papers.  Put completed papers in
    the Monday, Tuesday, etc. folders and Mallory will move them to
    the server each night.  There are also folders for each sub-group
    for sharing draft papers.  Move completed papers to the daily
    folders.  There is also a temporary folder that he will ignore;
    can be used for anything.

    Dan:  During the meeting, try to make the papers in text format
    so that everybody can edit them easily.  Final versions can be in
    other formats.

    Craig has been discussing co-arrays with colleagues and he has
    several substantive comments.  One would be willing to come here
    and discuss his comments, especially for cluster performance.  Plan
    is to invite him for Wednesday.

    Bill Long reported that DARPA had a conference on new languages.
    John Reid gave a talk on co-arrays that was well received. Other
    new languages were also discussed.  They probably won't become
    real production languages, but the expectation is that ideas move
    to existing languages.  All important programs studied used MPI
    and 17 were in Fortran.

    Cohen:  Please put references to actual work item in papers, not
    references to papers which have the references ....
