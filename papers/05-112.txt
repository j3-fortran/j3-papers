STATUS: For consideration

QUESTION:

What does "Generate an IEEE value" in 14.9.2 mean?

DISCUSSION:

Fortran 2003 in 14.9.2 has: "Generate an IEEE value" without any
explanation of what that means, nor any indication that it is
defined elsewhere.

ANSWER:

EDITS:

All edits refer to 04-007.pdf.

[370:29] Change "an IEEE value." to "an IEEE value (see
14.10.36)."

Or

[370:9] Add "The following functions are fully defined in
14.10.*."
