NUMBER: F90/000180
TITLE: Unambiguous generic references
KEYWORDS: host association, generic name
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION: Consider the following example:

     SUBROUTINE S()

       INTERFACE GEN1
         FUNCTION F1(I)
         END FUNCTION
         FUNCTION F2(I,J)
         END FUNCTION
       END INTERFACE

       INTERFACE GEN2
         FUNCTION G1()
         END FUNCTION
         FUNCTION G2(I)
         END FUNCTION
       END INTERFACE

       CALL SS()

       CONTAINS

          SUBROUTINE SS()

             INTERFACE GEN1
               FUNCTION F3(I,J,K)
               END FUNCTION
               FUNCTION F4(II)
               END FUNCTION
             END INTERFACE

             INTERFACE GEN2
               SUBROUTINE G3()
               END SUBROUTINE
             END INTERFACE

              A = GEN1(1,2,3)  ! CALL TO F3
              A = GEN1(1,2)    ! CALL TO F2
              A = GEN1(1)      ! CALL TO F4
              CALL GEN2()      ! CALL TO G3
         END SUBROUTINE

      END

There are rules in section 14.1.2.3 that determine within a scoping
unit what procedures can have the same generic specification.  These
rules directly mention access of a generic procedure via use
association, but they make no mention of generic names accessed via
host association.

There is evidence that the rules in section 14.1.2.3 were not intended
to apply to generic interfaces accessed by host association.  Section
14.1.2.4.1 indicates that a call to a generic name can be resolved to
a generic name in the host if the scoping unit and the host scoping
unit both agree that the generic name is the name of a function or a
subroutine.  This indicates that in the example above, the definition
of 'GEN2' is valid, even though 'G1' and 'G2' are functions while 'G3'
is a subroutine.  If the rules set out in 14.1.2.3 were to apply then
the definition of 'GEN2' would be invalid.

Do the rules in 14.1.2.3 apply to generic procedures accessed via host
association?

ANSWER:

Yes. [277:12-14] explains that the rules apply for all accessible
generic interfaces, including those accessible by host association.
The example program is not valid.

EDITS: None.
