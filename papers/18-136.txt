Subject: Use cases for default value for optional argument
Date: 2018-February-14

Reference: 18-122r1

Here's a simple and common use case for default values for optional
arguments, to be used in case the argument is absent.

  subroutine S ( ..., Do_More_Stuff )
    logical, intent(in), optional :: Do_More_Stuff
    logical :: My_Do_More_Stuff
    My_Do_More_Stuff = .false.
    if ( present(Do_More_Stuff) ) My_Do_More_Stuff = Do_More_Stuff

Some people try to do

  My_Do_More_Stuff = merge ( Do_More_Stuff, .false., &
                           &  present(My_Do_More_Stuff) )

but this gets a seg fault because of our eager-evaluation semantics.

People would like to be able to write

  subroutine S ( ..., Do_More_Stuff )
    logical, intent(in), optional :: Do_More_Stuff = .false.

The desired semantics are that if Do_More_Stuff is absent

  (1) present(Do_More_Stuff) still has the value .false., but
  (2) Do_More_Stuff has the value .false.

If the INTENT isn't IN, one can change the value.  If it has the
ALLOCATABLE or POINTER attribute, one can allocate it, etc.

A more interesting case might be

  subroutine S2 ( ...,  Info )
    real, intent(inout) :: Info = [ -huge(0.0), huge(0.0) ]
or
    real, allocatable, intent(inout) :: Info = [ -huge(0.0), huge(0.0) ]

In this case, if Info is absent, it behaves internally as if it were an
automatic array of size(2) with the specified value.  The procedure can
change its value, deallocate it (if it's allocatable), etc -- which
can't affect a corrresponding actual argument because there isn't one.

The upshot is that an absent dummy argument with a default initial value
behaves like an automatic variable with all the specified attributes
(and respecting INTENT(IN) if it appears), that is initially allocated
on every invocation if it is allocatable (and of course deallocated upon
return).

If I were a developer, I would create the same sort of descriptor as
would be used for an automatic variable.  If the argument is present,
fill the descriptor from the dummy argument.  If the argument is absent,
create an automatic variable in the stack or heap, and describe it in
the descriptor.

Alternative features that would solve some of the same sorts of problems
are short-circuit logical operators (for the logical case):

  My_Do_More_Stuff = present(Do_More_Stuff) .andthen. Do_More_Stuff

or conditional expressions

  real, allocatable :: My_Info
  My_Info = present(info) .then. info .else. [ -huge(0.0), huge(0.0) ]

These are both somewhat more general, but less terse, and need a local
variable instead of an anonymous automatic variable known by the same
name as the dummy argument if it's absent.
