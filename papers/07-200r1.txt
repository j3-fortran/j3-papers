1. Introduction

There are a number of contradictions in the current standard which
remain in the current draft regarding the intrinsic functions that
return model number characteristics or which return model numbers,
and actual arguments that are IEEE infinities.

Some/most/all of these intrinsic functions are listed in existing
interp 0042.  However, the model number functions are not really
connected with the mathematical functions, so should and can be
resolved separately.

Finally, even if we give up on fixing the current standard, we should get
it right in F2008.  This paper discusses the problems and possible
solutions and proposes edits for F2008.  The interp process can run in
parallel, before or after this; it would be very easy to take the rest of
this paper, turn it into Discussion, Answer and Edits with the obvious
questions cherry-picked out of interp 0042 if that is thought to be useful
(seeing as how interp 0042 is a huge interp covering tons of functions,
waiting for interp 0042 itself to be answered is not a profitable course to
take).

These functions do seem to give the right answer for NaN arguments,
it is INF that is causing all the problems.

2. Contradictions and inconsistencies

FRACTION says its result is
  X*b**(-e) where b and e are as defined in 13.4 for the representation of
  X in the model that has the radix of X but no limits on exponent values.
  For INF, that means INF*2**(-INF).  IEEE defines both INF*0 and INF/INF
  as NaNs.  But the text of FRACTION later says that the answer for INF is
  INF.  That doesn't make sense - the fractional part doesn't even exist,
  it's certainly not INF.

  Also, the Description of FRACTION says it is the
    "Fractional part of the model representation of the argument value."
  I don't know what anyone can make of that since there isn't any decent
  model representation of INF, but it's certainly not INF.  INF doesn't
  have any defined fractional part - it's any nonzero fractional part
  with an infinite exponent.

  Looking at what happens with FRACTION(x) as x->INF, we see that
  FRACTION is a cyclic function ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 approx.  The
  limit simply does not exist.  Saying that FRACTION(INF)=INF makes as
  much sense as saying SIN(INF)=INF, and having it return an out-of-range
  but numerical result is as bad as having SIN return a number much bigger
  than 1.

RRSPACING says it returne the
  "Reciprocal of the relative spacing of ***MODEL NUMBERS*** near the
   argument value" (emphasis mine).

  Here, there is no "extended model" in use.  It is talking about the
  actual model numbers.

  It would seem obvious that since HUGE(X) is the closest model number to
  +INF, that RRSPACING(+INF)==RRSPACING(HUGE(X)).

  It then goes on to claim that this is provided by the formula
    | X times b**-e | times b**p
  where b, e and p are not the parameters for X, but the parameters
  for the ***model number nearest to X***.  There is no doubt that
  e==MAXEXPONENT(X) and p==DIGITS(X), thus for INF we have
    | INF times 2**-2048 | times 2**53
  which gives INF.

  It further goes on to claim (a contradiction!) that this is equal to
    ABS(FRACTION(X)) * RADIX(X)/EPSILON(X)
  The contradiction here being the less obvious one that ABS(FRACTION(X))
  is | X times b**-ee | not | X times b**-e |, where ee is the exponent
  of X in the extended model (no limits on exponent) not the basic model
  (e is in the range eMin to eMax).  This is going to give different
  results for subnormal numbers!  In any case,
    - if we think FRACTION(INF)==INF, this gives INF.
    - if we think FRACTION(INF)==NaN, this gives NaN.

  It then goes on to claim an even more obvious contradiction, that being
  that RRSPACING(INF)==0.  This does not fit with ANY of the possible
  values for RRSPACING according to the Description, the maths formula,
  or the Fortran formula!

  I surmise that the authors of this text were confused by "reciprocal"
  in conjunction with "spacing", and since 1/INF==0 thought 0 must be the
  right answer without working through what this function is meant to be
  returning.

  Looking at the limits as X->INF to see what we should be returning on
  basic principles, we see that RRSPACING is another of those bounded
  cyclic functions - its magnitude does not get bigger or small, it's
  just cyclic (like SIN).  So RRSPACING(INF)==NaN would seem to be a
  good answer on those general principles.

SPACING says it returns the
  "Absolute spacing of model numbers near the argument value."

  From this it is clear that SPACING(INF)==SPACING(HUGE(X)).  It's not
  talking about spacing of numbers in any *extended model*, it's not
  talking about spacing of machine numbers, it's not talking about
  spacing of IEEE numbers.

  It's talking about spacing of model numbers.

  We then go on to say that SPACING(INF)==INF.  There are *NO* model
  numbers spaced INF apart!  It's just not true.

  Looking at the limits, SPACING(x->INF) does tend to INF, so this one is
  not quite as egregious as the others.

  If one argued that HUGE wasn't "near" INF, one could argue that
  SPACING(X) should be NaN (by the definition) since there are no model
  numbers near INF.  Frankly, NaN is probably as useful or more useful
  in practice than INF.

  Finally, SPACING is not connected to RRSPACING (despite the name), it
  stands or falls on its own, so whatever answer we give here does not
  necessarily affect the answer we give on the others and vice versa.

3. Philosophical Discussion

Basically, IEEE infinities just don't match our models at all well.

We already added the "extended model" for a few intrinsics like FRACTION
to handle subnormal numbers.  However, even that does not cope terribly
well with INF.

Unless there are compelling reasons otherwise, our approach should be
to define the result for INF to be equal to the limit, and NaN if there
is no such limit.  I see no such compelling reason here.

For RRSPACING there was always a problem where we said it returned model
numbers but got the formulae wrong.  This was never intended to return
spacing of machine numbers, nor should it be changed so to do.  We should
just correct the formula so that it does what it says on the tin, viz
return the reciprocal relative spacing of model numbers.

Arguing that INF is not "near" any model number might seem like sophistry,
but I believe it is quite justifiable.  ABS(INF-number) is not small for
any model number, in fact it is bigger than all the model numbers.  That
gives us a reasonable "out" on the Descriptions.

A larger editorial change would be to actually define the "extended model"
(only used by a few functions) in 13.4 and reference that from those
functions instead of repeating the stuff about "no limits on exponent
range" all the time.  This paper is not going to propose that, but it is
worth considering.

4. Proposed fixes

FRACTION has no limit, and INF does not have a model representation,
so returning NaN (and raising INVALID) is the right thing.

RRSPACING has no limit, and there are no model numbers near INF,
so return NaN (and raise INVALID).  It should also be fixed to do
what it says, viz return the reciprocal relative spacing of *model
numbers*, not *machine numbers*.

SPACING has a limit, but there are no model numbers near INF.
Return NaN and raise INVALID.

5. Possible alternatives

If one thinks that +INF is "near" to HUGE(x),
  RRSPACING(INF) should return SPACING(INF)
and
  SPACING(INF) should return SPACING(Huge)
otherwise as above.

Note: there is no question that there are no model numbers near NaN,
      so the existing situation of NaN results for NaN arguments is fine.
