Discussion

The edits in J3/07-333r1 were rejected by the editor for the reasons
stated in J3/08-102.

We have checked our quotation from the IEEE standard and believe that
it is correct.

We did not intend to make any technical change. The difficulty lies
in the interpretation of the words in the Fortran 2003 standard.
The same words occur in TR 15580, so this is not something new.
This seems best discussed by J3 with the editor present. Perhaps
a formal interpretation needs to be raised.

The rest of this paper is based on J3/07-333 and J3/07-333r1.
For the edits to paragraphs 5-7 of 14.9, we prefer those of
J3/07-333. For the new note, we are happy with the changed wording
in J3/07-333r1 and have removed the IEEE symbol <->.

The editor remarks that there can be no operations defined by
intrinsic functions. While this is true for Fortran operations,
it is not so for the operations of the IEEE standard. Section 5
of the IEEE standard states
   "All conforming implementations of this standard shall provide
   operations to add, subtract, multiply, divide, extract the square
   root, find the remainder, round to integer in floating-point format,
   convert between different floating-point formats, convert between
   floating-point and integer formats, convert binary <-> decimal, and
   compare."
Edits are provided to make this clear.

The editor also says that it would help to know exactly which
specifications are involved. We agree and propose the addition of a
note.


Edits to 08-007

[447:4-6,8-10,12-14] In 14.9 IEEE arithmetic, replace the second
sentence of paragraph 5 by
   "Where these are supported, their behavior for the unary and
   binary operations of Section 5 of the IEEE International Standard
   including those defined by intrinsic functions and by functions
   in intrinsic modules, shall be consistent with the specifications
   in the IEEE International Standard".
Make the same change in paragraphs 6 and 7.

[447:14+] In 14.9 IEEE arithmetic, after paragraph 7, add

   "NOTE 14.7a
   The operations specified in Section 5 of the IEEE International
   Standard are add, subtract, multiply, divide, extract the square root,
   find the remainder, round to integer in floating-point format, convert
   between different floating-point formats, convert between
   floating-point and integer formats, convert between binary and
   decimal, and compare."
