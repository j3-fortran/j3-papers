Discussion
----------

This is not proposing a solution, but is attempting to explain why I
regard the current wording on event synchronisation as inadequate.  I am
uploading it as a paper in case anyone not on the coarray discussion
list wants to see it.

Let me start with two simple questions:

Q.1:  Do we intent to permit a processor to implement EVENT POST by
      (say) calling MPI_Ssend, thus causing that image to wait until
      the matching EVENT WAIT is executed?

While that may not be an optimised implementation, it is a reasonable
one.  If we do not intend to allow it, then we need to say so,
explicitly.

Q.2:  Do we intend that the following program is conforming, and that
      the EVENT_QUERY will eventually recognise the EVENT POST?

    Image 1:  POST EVENT (q[2])

    Image 2:  DO
                  CALL EVENT_QUERY (q, n)
                  IF (n > 0) EXIT
              END DO

If it does, EVENT_QUERY necessarily has to perform a non-local action
with most implementations, in order to pick up incoming POST EVENTs.  In
MPI terms, that would mean at least an Iprobe.


The Main Issue
--------------

The current wording is as follows:

    During the execution of the program, the count of an event
    variable is changed by the execution of a sequence of EVENT POST
    and EVENT WAIT statements. If the count of an event variable
    increases through the execution of an EVENT POST statement on
    image M and later in the sequence decreases through the execution
    of an EVENT WAIT statement on image T, the segments preceding the
    EVENT POST statement on image M precede the segments following the
    EVENT WAIT statement on image T.

This immediately raises the question of what does "later" mean?  This is
very closely related to the atomic issues, but cannot be left
unspecified (i.e. ambiguous), even temporarily.  Let us choose just
three of the plethora of possible interpretations for consideration:

    A) As specified explicitly in the standard by 2.3.5 Execution
sequence and 8.5 Image execution control, and nothing else;

    B) As in (A), but with the extra constraint that there can be
no time-warps on a single datum;

    C) Full 'causal consistency' in a sense that I am going to leave
vague, but is best thought of as sequential consistency.


Example 1
---------

    TYPE(EVENT_TYPE) :: q[*]
    INTEGER :: x[*], n

Image 1:
    EVENT POST ( q[2] )    ! Action P
    x[4] = 123    ! Potentially undefined
    EVENT POST ( q[2] )    ! Action Q

Image 2:
    CALL EVENT_QUERY ( q, n)
    IF ( n == 2 ) THEN
        EVENT WAIT ( q )    ! Action R
        x[4] = 456    ! Potentially undefined
    ELSE
        EVENT WAIT ( q )    ! Action S
    END IF
    EVENT WAIT ( q )
    PRINT *, x[1]

With interpretation (A), it is UNdefined, because the only constraint
on action R is that it follows SOME post, which could be action P.

With interpretations (B) and (C), it is defined but that implies
synchronisation through the call of EVENT_QUERY (which conflicts with
Note 7.1 and our intent).


Example 2
---------

    TYPE(EVENT_TYPE) :: q[*]
    INTEGER :: x[*], n

Image 1:
    EVENT POST ( q[2] )    ! Action P
    x[4] = 123    ! Potentially undefined
    EVENT POST ( q[3] )    ! Action Q

Image 2:
    CALL EVENT_QUERY ( q, n)
    IF ( n == 2 ) THEN
        EVENT WAIT ( q )    ! Action R
        x[4] = 456    ! Potentially undefined
    ELSE
        EVENT WAIT ( q )    ! Action S
    END IF
    EVENT WAIT ( q )
    PRINT *, x[1]

Image 3:
    CALL EVENT_QUERY ( q, n)
    IF (n == 1) EVENT POST ( q[2] )    ! Action T

Compare this with example 1.  The only difference is that action Q now
has an effect on action R through another image.  We might want example
1 to be defined, but I don't think that we want this one to be.  I know
that image 2 will hang if action T is not performed, but please ignore
that, as it is irrelevant to the main point.


Example 3
---------

    LOGICAL(KIND=ATOMIC_LOGICAL_KIND) :: p[*] = .False.
    TYPE(EVENT_TYPE) :: q[*]
    INTEGER :: x[*]
    LOGICAL :: y

Image 1:
    EVENT POST ( q[2] )    ! Action P
    x[4] = 123    ! Potentially undefined
    EVENT POST ( q[2] )    ! Action Q
    CALL ATOMIC_DEFINE( p[3], .True. )    ! Action X

Image 2:
    CALL ATOMIC_REF( y, p[3] )    ! Action Y
    IF ( y ) THEN
        EVENT WAIT ( q )    ! Action R
        x[4] = 456    ! Potentially undefined
    ELSE
        EVENT WAIT ( q )    ! Action S
    END IF
    PRINT *, x[1]

NOTE: Because of 13.1 paragraph 3, a processor may specify that this
example is defined.  I am considering the case where it has stated that
how sequences of atomic actions in unordered segments interleave with
each other is unspecified.

With interpretation (A), this is UNdefined, because the only constraint
on action R is that it follows SOME post, which could be action P.

With interpretation (B), it is UNdefined, but not in a way that most
users would expect.  It is easiest to see the problem using a graph of
all of the links specified by 2.3.5, 8.5 and the TS 6.4:

    Image 1            Image 2
    Action P ->        Action X
       |        \         |
       |         \        V
       V           --> Action R
    Action Q ->           |
       |        \         V
       V          -->  Action S
    Action Y

It is easy to see that action X is in a segment that is unordered with
respect to the one that action Y is in, so the standard specifies no
ordering of actions X and Y (and, in the case I am considering, the
processor doesn't, either).  So  action R may match action P, the
two assignments to x[1] are undefined, and the program is undefined.

With interpretation (C), it is defined but that implies synchronisation
though atomic accesses in unordered segments (which conflicts with 13.1
paragraph 3).
