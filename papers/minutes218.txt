1. Monday, February 11, 2019 8:00 am
---------------------------------------------------------------
1.1 Opening business                              D. Nagle
Remarks from the chair                            D. Nagle
  Lack of clarity in procedure.  We need to leave a better record
When a subgroup wishes to kill a feature, write a paper and bring
to plenary for final dispensation.
  Task for this meeting is to work on the US wish list, and try to
get as much done as possible before the Tokyo meeting.
   Second priority is interpretations.

Adoption of agenda                                D. Nagle
    Steidel/Snyder Unanimous Consent (UC)

Approval of Meeting 217 minutes                   D. Nagle
    Lionel/Clune (UC)

INCITS report (if any)                            D. Nagle
    Dan's 3year term as chair is up; does anyone else want to do this?
    (dead silence)

IEEE/754 report (if any)                          R. Corbett
  IEEE committee failed to complete standard by 2018.  Going to take
another year.  LIkely to have some features that are less specified
in the 2019 version.  Problems with 2018 ballot were with new features
late in process.  (New features related to bit-for-bit reproduceability)
IEEE has the rule that only one exception allowed per compare,
the "invalid" exception.

WG23 report (if any)                              D. Nagle
Hopeful that Dan will be allowed to work on WG23 again.  NCAR is
not enthusiastic.  POSIX has gone down a step, and is likey to
be withdrawn as a standard.  There will be LSG as replacement
(Linux Study Group).

WG9 report                                        V.Snyder
Paper 19-128 describes some issues going on with WG9.
19-118 is the notice of the Ada-Europe 24th International Conference

MPI Liaison report (if any)                       B. Long
Nothing new to report.

OpenMP Liaison report (if any)                    B. Long
The 5.0 specification was released at SC last November. A book of the
specification is being sold on Amazon, if people want a hard copy:

https://www.amazon.com/dp/1795759887

The OpenMP language committee held a F2F meeting last week, hosted by
NVIDIA at its Santa Clara office. A TR release is scheduled for SC'19,
and 5.1 is scheduled for SC'20. 5.1 is a minor release, and we don't
plan on adding any major features, or at least any major features that
would require a significant amount of implementation work. The next
major release, 6.0, is expected to be release at SC'22.

Here are some of the topics that were discussed in the various
subcommittees, along with the projected release version it will be
introduced in:

-- Miscellaneous Topics

[5.1] loop construct refinements (proposed by NVIDIA): the OMP LOOP
      construct was added in 5.0, and it allows loops to be executed
      in parallel using a team, parallel, or SIMD-level
      parallelism. The committee wants to add clauses to the loop
      construct to give more control to the user on how the loops is
      parallelized using the construct.

[5.1] SIMD extensions (proposed by Intel): allow use of function
      pointers in SIMD regions; new SIMD clauses for compress, expand,
      conflict, and "allow early exit" support

[6.0] Loop transformation clauses (proposed by Argonne National Lab):
      a set of clauses that can be applied to a loop nest to specify a
      variety of desired loop transformations (e.g. interchange,
      stripmining, loop fusion, loop peeling, unrolling, loop
      reversal, etc.).

[6.0] General Induction Support (proposed by Intel)

-- Affinity Topics

[5.1] Affinity control for teams construct

[5.1] Expressing affinity between tasks and devices

-- Accelerator topics

A large number of topics, as usual, were discussed within the
accelerator subcommittee:

[5.1] add Fortran versions of device memory routines
      (omp_target_alloc, omp_target_free, omp_target_associate_ptr,
      omp_target_disassociate_ptr, omp_target_memcpy,
      omp_target_memcpy_rect, omp_target_is_present).

[5.1] device-specific environment variables

[5.1] improved pointer initialization in target regions

[5.1] add is_present clause or map-type for device constructs

[5.1] allow use of function pointers within target regions

[5.1] provide asynchronous versions of the device memory routines

[5.1] add "omp promise" directive, where the users asserts certain
      properties about a given OpenMP region that would enable more
      efficient implementation of the region.

[5.1] support callls to contain functions (for Fortran) in target
      regions

[5.1/6.0] expose underlying streams for asynchronous execution/data
          transfer (e.g. CUDA streams)

[5.1/6.0] enhance deep copy support with serialize/deserialize
          functions

[6.0+] operating on classes with virtual methods in target regions

-- Tasking topics

[5.1] add task-data affinity control and dependences for taskloop
      construct

[5.1] add schedule clause to taskloop

[6.0+] Support repeatable task graphs

[6.0+] Support real time applications.

[6.0+] task width (reserves N number of threads for execution of a
       given task)

[6.0+] Allow threads that don't bind to a parallel region to be
       available for task execution ("unshackled" threads)

-- Fortran topics

[5.1] Define restrictions for coarray usage with OpenMP -- coindexed
      list items not allowed in clauses, privatized coarrays
      effectively lose "coarray" property, image control statements
      may only appear in sequential part of program, and coindexed
      references must be serialized within a given image and cannot
      occur on target devices.

[5.1/6.0] Improve support for usage of array syntax in target regions
          to take advantage of parallel teams and parallel threads.

[5.1/6.0] Allowing loop or workshare constructs to be applied to DO
          CONCURRENT loops

-- C/C++

[5.1] Adopt attribute syntax as substitute for various declarative
      directives

[5.1] Define behavior for use of noreturn, move operations, and
      alignment

[5.1] Define behavior for use of base language atomic and fence
      operations

UPC Liaison report (if any)                       B. Friesen
Quiet, little new code is being written.
More focus on GASNet.

OpenACC Liaison report (if any)                   G. Klimowicz
Information about OpenACC, including the current standard document,
training materials, and upcoming events can be found at
http://www.openacc.org/.

The current OpenACC 2.6 standard includes support for manual deep copy
of data structures to target processors.

There are over 110 applications in production or development using
OpenACC, including:
    - Gaussian 16
    - ANSYS Fluent
    - VASP
    - MPAS-A
    - COSMO
    - GAMERA for GPU
    - Quantum Espresso

There are more "hackathons" coming up in 2019, where researchers
bring their codes to work alongside with OpenACC experts to accelerate
their applications.
Event dates are posted at https://www.openacc.org/events.

OpenACC has ratified version 2.7:
1. Make it clear that the host can be a device.
2. Listing which fortran intrinsics and math.h functions
   should be supported.
3. Fortran bindings for API routines.
4. Treat reduction as a data clause (for parallel loop reduction).
5. Clarify that the host data construct used without "use device"
   means nothing
6. Array reductions
7. "acc parallel self" - run this in parallel on the current device

Version 2.7 of the OpenACC specification can be found at
https://www.openacc.org/specification.

We also understand that at the OpenMP face-to-face meeting last fall
that the OpenMP group is planning to create a roadmap for how OpenACC
constructs are mapped to OpenMP constructs. This would effectively
mean that "#pragma acc" would be treated as a new way to spell
"#pragma omp" and dramatically reduce the porting problem for codes
that used both.


OpenSource Flang report (if any)                  G. Klimowicz
Flang is an open source compiler for Fortran, sponsored by the US
Department of Energy (particularly, LLNL, Sandia and LANL).

The goals of the project are to
    - Create a new, open source Fortran 2018 compiler with
      Apache 2.0 licensing,
    - that can be used for language and parallelization
      experimentation,
    - that exists as a peer in the LLVM community of languages,
      like Clang,
    - that can rely on LLVM code generation and parallelism
      support for CPUs and GPUs.

There are flang-dev and flang-announce mailing lists you can join
for discussion of Flang at http://lists.flang-compiler.org/ and a
Slack channel, http://flang-compiler.slack.com/ for more

There is a biweekly half-hour conference call providing status
updates on Flang, every other Wednesday at 8:30 AM Pacific time
(the next is February 20, 2018). If you are interested in
participating in these calls, please let Gary Klimowicz
(gklimowicz@nvidia.com) know and he will forward the meeting
invitation.


Current Flang Compiler
----------------------

The initial version of Flang is derived from the PGI Fortran
compiler, with some proprietary features removed (OpenACC
support, inter-procedure analysis). It was published on GitHub in
May 2017 at github.com/flang-compiler, and consists of several
subprojects (including the Flang driver and compiler itself, and
changes to LLVM to support Fortran debug metadata to be upstreamed).
The current compiler supports Fortran 2003 and some Fortran 2008
features.

Recent improvements to Flang include
    - many bug fixes and enhancements from the PGI compiler;
    - many improvements in the libpgmath library;
    - initial support for OpenMP target offload based on
      Clang's LLVM 7.0 work.

Flang is available for Linux on x86-64, OpenPOWER and Arm
processors, and is the basis of the Arm commercial Fortran
compiler. AMD has indicated their interest in adopting flang
as well. Members of the community are also working on ports to
Mac OS X and packages for OpenBSD and FreeBSD.

Contributions to this version of the compiler are encouraged,
but require executing a contributor license agreement (CLA)
with NVIDIA due to the nature of the way we combine internal
and external improvements to Flang.
interactive communication with the Flang community.

The New F18 Compiler
--------------------

The older code base used to seed the initial Flang compiler is not
going to meet the long-term goals of the project. NVIDIA has begun a
new project to rewrite the Fortran front-end in C++ to better align
with the LLVM and Clang communities and to better leverage the
existing tools and techniques from these communities.

This new front-end, which we call F18, is available at
https://github.com/flang-compiler/f18. All development for F18
is being done on the open source repository, and you can follow
the pull request activity from our developers there.

No contributor license agreement is needed to contribute to F18,
which is being developed under the Apache 2.0 license with LLVM
extensions (the same as LLVM and Clang).

The current state of F18 is
    - written in modern C++ following LLVM conventions;
    - parses all of Fortran 2018 to abstract syntax trees (AST);
    - implements preprocessing directives;
    - recognizes most common comment-based directives
      (including OpenMP), though there is limited semantic
      processing;
    - implements semantic analysis for types and symbols, including
      derived types, modules and submodules, constants and constant
      expressions;
    - has initial "Fortran Intermediate Representation" tree
      definition for defining a control flow graph above that provided
      by LLVM IR.

We are at a point where people interested in Fortran tooling
(formatters, preprocessors, source-to-source compilers) can use
the F18 parser. We are encouraging people to do so and to provide
feedback and enhancements to F18.

Upcoming work includes
    - continued work on statement and expression semantics, lowering
      from AST to FIR trees;
    - definition of runtime environment;
    - implementation of Fortran I/O semantics and runtime.

We plan to be able to compile single-threaded Fortran 2018 programs
this year.

   19-133r1 "Use cases for exception handling"
   [Clune/Nagle/Lionel/Klimowicz] (For discussion, no vote)
   Discussions:
      Not all exceptions can be handled.
      Issues on popping up the stack on an exception
      Cost both at runtime, and at implementation time even for users
      Should decide what a Fortran handler can do, which will influence
       what it looks like
      Don't throw it out just because can't do 100%
      Block-based could be helpful to enable/disable different exceptions
      Can't always fix-up and continue, in fact, it's been unacceptable
        in previous years
      Most of the problems can be resolved by having a good traceback.
      Library developers have a need for this; don't want the whole
        app to fail just because of an exception in the library
      Alternate returns from library functions have been used
      Some users pass the status variable but don't check it.
        (bad user on device)
      Issues with old code that didn't do status checking, in a
        sandwich way, if the bottom bread (new code) can raise an
        exception it overrides the middle
      Provide the tools already (in STAT=, ERR= etc) Don't encourage
