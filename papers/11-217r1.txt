NUMBER: F03/0053
TITLE: The BIND attribute for C_PTR and C_FUNPTR
KEYWORDS: BIND attribute, C_PTR, C_FUNPTR, private components
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

1. Do the derived types C_PTR and C_FUNPTR have the BIND attribute?

This affects whether an object of one of these types is permitted
directly in COMMON.  C5101 in the Fortran 2008 standard states "If a
common-block-object is of a derived type, it shall be a sequence type
or a type with the BIND attribute and it shall have no default
initialization."

2. Whether the derived types C_PTR and C_FUNPTR have the BIND
attribute affects whether they are extensible.  Subclause 4.5.7.1 of
the Fortran 2008 standard states "A nonsequence derived type that does
not have the BIND attribute is an extensible type."  Are these types
extensible?

3. Subclause 15.3.3 of the Fortran 2008 standard states that C_PTR and
C_FUNPTR are derived types with private components. Are user-defined
derived types with the BIND attribute permitted to have private
components?

ANSWER:

1. No, these types do not have the BIND(C) attribute.  15.3.3 does not
specify that they have the BIND(C) attribute.  15.3.4 does not require
them to have the BIND attribute in order to make them interoperable.
15.3.5 would require them to interoperate with a C struct if they had
the BIND(C) attribute; this is absurd, since C object pointers and C
function pointers are clearly not structs.

Note that whether these types have default initialization is not
specified by the standard, so possession of BIND(C) would not
necessarily have allowed them in COMMON anyway.

2. No, these types were not intended to be extensible.  It was an
oversight that these types were not explicitly excluded from being
extensible by subclause 4.5.7.1 paragraph 1 of the Fortran 2008
standard.  An edit is provided to correct this.

3. Yes, a user-defined derived type with the BIND attribute is
permitted to have private components.

Insert ", other than the type C_PTR or C_FUNPTR from the intrinsic
module ISO_C_BINDING," after "A derived type".
