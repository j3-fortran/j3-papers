Subject: Spurious defined terms in clause 4.
Date: 2009/02/10

1. Introduction
---------------

The system for "defining" terms we used in previous versions of the
standard is not in accordance with the ISO guidelines, so we need to stop
using it.  We have already introduced the ISO-compliant defined terms
subclause, and moved/copied many definitions into it.  However, quite a lot
have not been revised.  These should either
  - be turned into normal text ("untermified")
or
  - become proper defined terms.

This paper deals with the terms in clause 4.


2. Terms and what to do with them
---------------------------------

 - unlimited polymorphic: special term;
   = termify and hyperlink.

 - integer type: Common Usage;
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - representation method: Normal Usage;
   = untermify, index not as definition.

 - real type: Common Usage;
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - approximation method: Normal Usage;
   = untermify, do not index.

 - default real: Misleading Usage;
   = untermify, reword, index as definition.
   The problem with the current usage is that it says there is a type
   called "default real", whereas in fact the type is "real" and it is
   the *kind* that is "default".  This confusing usage has long been
   complained about - and we already fixed many of them, but not the
   definition itself.

 - complex type: Common Usage;
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - real part: Normal Usage;
   = untermify, do not index.

 - imaginary part: Normal Usage;
   = untermify, do not index.

 - default complex: Misleading Usage;
   = untermify, reword, index as definition.

 - character type: Common Usage;
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - length: Normal Usage;
   = untermify, do not index.

 - ASCII character set: Obvious Variation ("ASCII character" + "set");
   = untermify, do not index.

 - ASCII character: Special Term, Widely Used;
   = termify, index as definition.

 - ISO 10646 character set: Obvious Variation;
   = untermify, do not index.

 - ISO 10646 character; Special Term;
   = termify.

 - default character: Misleading Usage;
   = untermify, reword, index as definition.

 - character literal constant: Totally Obvious;
   = untermify, index as definition, reword the definition
   because it is a lie (does not accurately describe the synatx
   which in any case appears immediately afterwards).

 - representable character: Totally Obvious, Duplicates BNF <rep-char>,
                            Virtually Unused;
   = untermify, do not index.

 - ASCII collating sequence: Just a Name;
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - logical type: Common Usage;
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - sequence structure: Special Term;
   = termify, do not index this definition as it is pointless.

 - sequence type: Special Term;
   = termify, index as definition.

 - numeric sequence type: Not Immediately Obvious;
   = termify as sub-term of "sequence type", index definition

 - character sequence type: Not Immediately Obvious;
   = termify as sub-term of "sequence type", index definition.

NOTE: If others think the various sequence types are not significant enough
      to warrant making into defined terms I would be persuadable.

 - data-pointer-initialization compatible: Nauseating, Used Twice;
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - overrides: Normal Usage;
   untermify, index as definition at least twice, viz for default
   initialization, for type-bound procedures, for defined i/o, for
   type-spec in a FUNCTION statement - on second thoughts, just index
   them all as uses of "override", they are not definitions just saying
   when it happens.

 - type-bound procedure statement: It's just a statement;
   = untermify, index as statement.

 - type-bound procedure: Special Term;
   = termify as sub-term of "procedure", index as definition.
   NOTE: We have inconsistently used "generic procedure" and "generic
         interface" to mean the same thing both in the type-bound and
         non-type-bound cases.  For tbps, mostly we've used "generic
         interface", but for the non-tbp case mostly the other.  I've
         chosen here to make "type-bound procedure" include the generic
         case (including edits to straighten out the definition): if we
         decide to go the other way most of these will be wrong, plus
         we should have edits to straighten out the non-tbp case and the
         3 occurrences of "generic type[ -]bound procedure".

 - GENERIC statement: It's a statement = untermify, treat as statement.

 - binding: Special Term, Confusing;
   termify.

 - binding name: Special Term, Potentially Confusing;
   termify.

 - FINAL statement: It's a statement = untermify, treat as statement.

 - ancestor component: Common-Sense Usage;
   = untermify, index as definition.

 - component value: Only Used Once In The Defining Subclause (2 paras);
   = untermify, do not index.

 - array constructor: BNF Term Analogue;
   = untermify, reword, index as definition.

 - empty sequence: Totally Obvious, Only Used Once;
   already a defined term = untermify (delete definition), do not index.


3. Other proposed changes
-------------------------

(1) Attempts at various miscellaneous editorial cleanups are included.

(2) A TECHNICAL CHANGE is proposed (turning a syntactic requirement into
    a constraint).

(3) Several uses of "binding" are replaced with "type-bound procedure".
    The word "binding" has multiple meanings, so this makes it clearer.


4. Edits to 09-007
------------------

Note to the editor: Define new LaTeX command
  \stmtdefn{name}
    for statement definitions; it should repeat the name, add "statement",
    and index(d) as "name statement" and "statement!name".  Maybe this
    should also declare a \label so we can reference it directly?

[3:11+(1.3.4-)] Define term
  "\term{ASCII character}
   character whose representation method corresponds to ISO/IEC 646:1991
   (International Reference Version)"

[throughout] hyperlink "ASCII character" and index as appropriate.

[14:31-(1.3.101-)] Define term
  "\term{sequence structure}
   scalar data object of a sequence type (4.5.2.3)"
{That's "\ref{D4:Sequence type}";
 "scalar", "data object" and "sequence type" should all be hyperlinks;
 an alternative position would be as a sub-term of "structure".}

[14:31-(1.3.101-)] Define term and sub-terms
  "\term{sequence type}
   derived type with the SEQUENCE attribute (4.5.2.3)

   \subterm{character}{sequence type}

   components, and whose components are all default character or of
   another character sequence type

   sequence type with no type parameters, no allocatable or pointer
   components, and whose components are all default complex, default

[51:13(4.4.2p1)] Unembolden "integer type", index all of 4.4.2 as defn.

   value is KIND(0.0)."
  NOTE: hyperlink KIND to the intrinsic function, both here and at line 5.
{Keywords appear, and specify a type, they are not themselves "specified";
 the type is type real, "default real" is not a separate type!;
 new wording is similar to that of double precision;
 \mindexd* produces the text and indexes it as a definition.}

  "If the type keyword CHARACTER is used without a kind type parameter, the
   character type with \mindexd*{default character} kind is specified and
   the kind value is KIND('A')."
{See comment for default real.  All in one para because we do it like that
 for the other types.}

[56:19-20(4.4.5.3p1)] Replace paragraph with
  "The syntax of a \mindexd*{character literal constant} is given by R423."

 be deferred.}

[156:1-3,1-4(7.2.1.2, Table 7.10)] Replace the two character lines in the
  table with a single entry "character    character".
{Previous specification faulty: we only required type conformance with this
 table, not kind conformance.}

[158:10+2(7.2.1.3 Note 7.40)] After "nondefault character",
