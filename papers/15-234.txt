1. Introduction
===============

Maybe the way type-bound generic interfaces work is abundantly clear to
some, but I found it to be confusing.  It could use some explanation.
Notes are proposed here.  Maybe it should be normative.

2. Edits
========

[15:15 1.3.115.6] Insert "or generic interface" after "procedure".
After "derived type" insert ", or inherited from its parent type and not
overridden,"

{4.5.5p3 at [76:33-34] specifies that a type-bound generic interface is
a type-bound procedure.  That part of the edit isn't technically needed,
but it is helpful.}

[80:11- NOTE 4.55+] Insert a note:
" NOTE 4.55a
    Where a generic interface is inherited, it specifies that the names
    of specific procedure bindings to the extension type, as they are
    specified or inherited in the parent type, are part of the generic
    interface bound to the extension type.  If a specific procedure
    binding is inherited and not overridden (4.5.7.3), it is part of the
    inherited generic interface.  If a specific procedure binding is
    overridden the overriding binding is part of the inherited generic
    interface and the inherited binding is not.
"

[311:11+ 12.5.6p3+] Insert a note:

" NOTE 12.43a
    As a generic interface is inherited (4.5.7.2) into an extension
    type, it is useful to think of it as having added a row to a
    two-dimensional array.  Each column of the array is identified by
    the charactistics of a procedure.  The rules in 12.4.3.5.5 ensure
    that columns' identities are distinct.  Each row of the array is
    identified by the dynamic type of the <data-ref>.  When a generic
    type-bound procedure is referenced, the characteristics of the
    actual arguments, except for the declared type of the <data-ref> if
    the procedure has a passed-object dummy argument, select a column of
    the array, and the dynamic type selects a row.  The declared type of
    the <data-ref> is not used for generic resolution if the procedure
    has a passed-object dummy argument because the reference might be to
    an inherited specific binding, for which the declared type of the
    passed-object dummy argument is necessarily an ancestor type.
