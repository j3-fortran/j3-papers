Introduction
------------

The system for interoperability between the C language, as
standardized by ISO/IEC 9899:1999, and Fortran, as standardized by
ISO/IEC 1539-1:2009, provides for interoperability of procedure
interfaces with arguments that are non-optional scalars, explicit
shape arrays, or assumed size arrays. These are the cases where the
Fortran and C data concepts directly correspond. Interoperability is
not provided for important cases where there is not a direct
correspondence between C and Fortran.

The existing system for interoperability does not provide for
interoperability of interfaces with Fortran dummy arguments that are
assumed-shape arrays, dummy arguments with the Fortran allocatable or
pointer attribute, or optional dummy arguments.  As a consequence, a
significant class of Fortran subprograms are not portably accessible
from C, limiting the usefulness of the facility.

The existing system also does not provide for interoperability with C
prototypes that have formal parameters declared (void *). The class of
such C functions includes widely used library functions that involve
copying blocks of data, such as those in the MPI library.

This technical report extends the facility of Fortran for
interoperating with C to provide for interoperability of procedure
interfaces that specify optional dummy arguments, assumed shape dummy
arguments, or dummy arguments with the allocatable or pointer
attributes.  New Fortran concepts of assumed-type and assumed-rank are
provided to facilitate interoperability of procedure interfaces with C
prototypes with formal parameters declared (void *).

The facility specified in this technical report is a compatible
extension of Fortran as standardized by ISO/IEC 1539-1:2009. It does
not require that any changes be made to the C language as standardized
by ISO/IEC 9899:1999.


Optional arguments
------------------

A C function reference indicates that an actual argument is not
present by supplying NULL as the value of that argument.  A nonpresent
optional argument of a C function is indicated by the corresponding
formal parameter having the value NULL.  This design matches the common
usage style in C for specifying that an actual argument is not
provided.

To avoid ambiguity with an actual argument that has the same internal
representation as NULL, the OPTIONAL and VALUE attributes shall not
both be specified for a dummy argument in a Fortran interface with the
BIND attribute.


Assumed-type variables:
-----------------------

An <assumed-type> variable is a variable declared with TYPE (*).

An <assumed-type> variable shall be a dummy variable. An
<assumed-type> variable shall not have the CODIMENSION, EXTERNAL,
INTRINSIC, or VALUE attribute.

The ALLOCATABLE, ASYNCHRONOUS, CONTIGUOUS, DIMENSION, INTENT,
OPTIONAL, POINTER, TARGET, and VOLATILE attributes are allowed.

An assumed-type variable may appear only as a dummy argument, an
actual argument associated with a dummy argument that is assumed-type,
or the first argument to these intrinsic and intrinsic module
functions: ALLOCATED, ASSOCIATED, IS_CONTIGUOUS, LBOUND, PRESENT,
RANK, SHAPE, SIZE, UBOUND, or C_LOC.

An explicit interface is required for a procedure that has an
assumed-type dummy argument.

In the association of actual and dummy arguments, an assumed-type
dummy argument is type and kind compatible with an actual data
argument of any type.

In specific interfaces of a generic interface, corresponding dummy
arguments may include an assumed-type dummy argument. Disambiguation
relies on the characteristics of the corresponding arguments other
than type or on characteristics of other dummy arguments.

A BIND(C) interface may specify dummy arguments that are
assumed-type. If the dummy argument is a scalar, an explicit-shape
array, or an assumed-size array, the corresponding formal parameter in
the C prototype shall be a void pointer (void *).  If the dummy
argument has the ALLOCATABLE or POINTER attributes, or is
assumed-shape or assumed-rank, the actual argument is passed as the C
address of a Fortran descriptor describing the actual argument.


Assumed-rank variables:
-----------------------

An <assumed-rank> variable is a variable declared with the DIMENSION
attribute with an <assumed-rank-spec>, DIMENSION(..).

An <assumed-rank> variable shall be a dummy
variable. An <assumed-rank> variable shall not have the CODIMENSION,
EXTERNAL, INTRINSIC, or VALUE attribute.

The ALLOCATABLE, ASYNCHRONOUS, CONTIGUOUS, DIMENSION, INTENT,
OPTIONAL, POINTER, TARGET, and VOLATILE attributes are allowed.

An assumed-rank variable may appear only as a dummy argument, an
actual argument associated with a dummy argument that is assumed-rank,
the argument of the C_LOC intrinsic function in the ISO_C_BINDING
module, or the first argument in a reference to the intrinsic inquiry
functions except LCOBOUND, UCOBOUND, and IMAGE_INDEX. A new inquiry
intrinsic RANK is added to inquire about the rank of an array.

An explicit interface is required for a procedure that has an
assumed-rank dummy argument.

In the association of actual and dummy arguments, an assumed-rank
dummy argument is rank compatible with a corresponding actual argument
of any rank. If the actual argument is scalar, the dummy argument has
rank zero and the shape and bounds are arrays of zero size. If the
actual argument is an array, the bounds of the dummy argument are
assumed from the actual argument. In other respects, the rules for
assumed-rank dummy arguments are similar to those for assumed-shape
arrays.

In specific interfaces of a generic interface, corresponding dummy
arguments may include an assumed-rank dummy argument. Disambiguation
relies on the characteristics of the corresponding arguments other
than rank or on characteristics of other dummy arguments.

A BIND(C) interface may specify dummy arguments that are
assumed-rank. If the dummy argument is assumed-rank, the actual
argument is passed as the C address of a Fortran descriptor describing
the actual argument.


Object Descriptors
------------------

A <<Fortran descriptor>> is an structure used by the processor to
describe an object that is assumed-shape, assumed-rank, allocatable,
or a data pointer.  The Fortran processor may already define a
structure for this purpose independent of a use in interface
operability with C prototypes. If this structure contains sufficient
information it may be used directly as a Fortran descriptor. The
internal structure of a Fortran descriptor might not be the same for
all implementations, so direct use of this descriptor by a C
programmer is not portable. Therefore, a new descriptor, the <<C
descriptor>> is specified along with library functions with standard
prototypes that allow for conversion between Fortran and C
descriptors. This two descriptor model for describing data objects has
these characteristics:

1) The internal structure of the Fortran descriptor is not exposed to
   the C programmer.

2) The C descriptor contains enough information to efficiently access
   the described object within a C function.

3) The C descriptor contains enough information to create a
   corresponding Fortran descriptor that is usable by the companion
   Fortran processor.

4) A method is provided to the C function that allows for allocation
   or deallocation of objects that is compatible with effects of the
   corresponding Fortran ALLOCATE and DEALLOCATE statements.

5) A method is provided to compute stride multipliers based on lower
   bound, extent, and stride values.


Fortran descriptors
-------------------

The Fortran descriptor for an object shall contain enough information
that the following can be determined by the C library function that
converts a Fortran descriptor to a C descriptor.

1) The base C address of the object unless the object is an
   unallocated allocatable, or a data pointer that is not associated.

2) The size, as would be returned by the C sizeof operator, of a
   scalar of the same type and type parameter values as the object.

3) The Fortran rank of the object. If this value is zero, the object
   is scalar.

4) Whether the object has the pointer attribute.

5) Whether the object has the allocatable attribute.

6) If the Fortran object has the pointer attribute, whether or not the
   pointer is associated.

7) If the Fortran object has the allocatable attribute, whether or not
   the object is allocated.

8) The type of the object if the object is of intrinsic interoperable
   type, or that the object is of derived type.

9) Triples that contain the lower bound, extent, and stride
   multiplier for each dimension of the object unless the object is an
   unallocated allocatable, a pointer that is not associated, or a
   scalar.

The Fortran descriptor may contain additional information that is not
required to create a corresponding C descriptor.


C descriptors
-------------

The C descriptor is a struct of type CFI_desc_t. This struct is
defined in the file ISO_Fortran_binding.h. It shall contain these
components:

base_addr - pointer of type void. If the object is an unallocated
            allocatable or a pointer that is not associated, the value
            is NULL. If the object has zero size, the value is
            processor-dependent. Otherwise, the value is the base
            address of the object being described. The base address of
            a scalar is its C address. The base address of an array is
            the C address of the element for which each subscript has
            the value of the corresponding lower bound.

elem_len - type size_t, equal to the sizeof() of an element of the
           object being described

rank - type int, equal to the number of dimensions of the object being
       described. If the object is a scalar, the value is zero.

type - type int, equal to the identifier for the type of the
       object. Each interoperable intrinsic C type has an
       identifier. The identifier for interoperable structures has a
       different value from any of the identifiers for intrinsic
       types. Symbolic names and the corresponding values for the
       identifiers are supplied in the ISO_Fortran_binding.h file.

attribute - type int, equal to the value of an attribute code that
            indicates whether the object being described is a data
            pointer, allocatable, or assumed-shape.  Symbolic names
            and the corresponding values for the attribute codes are
            supplied in the ISO_Fortran_binding.h file.

state - type int, has the value 1 if the object is an allocated
        allocatable, an associated pointer, or assumed-shape, and 0
        otherwise.

fdesc - pointer of type void that points to the corresponding Fortran
        descriptor if one exists; otherwise the value is NULL.

dim[CFI_MAX_RANK] - array of type CFI_dim_t. Each element of the array
        contains the lower bound, extent, and stride multiplier
        information for the corresponding dimension of the
        object. CFI_MAX_RANK is a constant defined in the file
        ISO_Fortran_binding.h. The number of elements actually used is
        equal to the rank of the object. This component is not used if
        the object is a scalar.

The struct of type CFI_dim_t is used to hold lower bound, extent, and
stride multiplier information for one dimension of an array. It  is
defined in the file ISO_Fortran_binding.h, and contains these
components:

lower_bound - type intptr_t, equal to the value of the lower bound of
              an array for a specified dimension.

extent - type intptr_t, equal to the number of elements of an array
         along a specified dimension.

sm - type intptr_t, equal to the stride multiplier for a
     dimension. The value is the distance in bytes between the
     beginnings of successive elements of the array along a specified
     dimension.

The following constant is defined in the file ISO_Fortran_binding.h:

CFI_MAX_RANK - a value of type int equal to the largest rank
               supported. The value shall be greater than or equal to
               15.

The following constants are defined in the file ISO_Fortran_binding.h
for use as attribute codes. The values shall be of type int,
nonnegative, and distinct.

CFI_attribute_assumed
CFI_attribute_allocatable
CFI_attribute_pointer

The following constants are defined in the file ISO_Fortran_binding.h
for use as type specifiers. The values are of type int. The value for
CFI_type_struct shall be distinct from all the other type
specifiers. If an intrinsic C type is not interoperable with a Fortran
type and kind supported by the companion processor, its specifier
shall have a negative value. Otherwise, the specifier for an intrinsic
type shall be positive.

CFI_type_struct         - specifier for an interoperable struct
CFI_type_signed_char    - specifier for type as indicated in name
CFI_type_short
CFI_type_int
CFI_type_long
CFI_type_long_long
CFI_type_size_t
CFI_type_int8_t
CFI_type_int16_t
CFI_type_int32_t
CFI_type_int64_t
CFI_type_int_least8_t
CFI_type_int_least16_t
CFI_type_int_least32_t
CFI_type_int_least64_t
CFI_type_int_fast8_t
CFI_type_int_fast16_t
CFI_type_int_fast32_t
CFI_type_int_fast64_t
CFI_type_intmax_t
CFI_type_intptr_t
CFI_type_float
CFI_type_double
CFI_type_long_double
CFI_type_float_Complex
CFI_type_double_Complex
CFI_type_long_double_Complex
CFI_type_Bool
CFI_type_char

Note that the specifiers for two intrinsic types may have the same
value.  For example, CFI_type_int and CFI_type_int32_t might have the
same value.


Assumed-shape, assumed-rank, allocatable, data pointer arguments
----------------------------------------------------------------

In a reference to a procedure whose interface has the BIND attribute,
the entity passed as the actual argument corresponding to a dummy
argument that is an interoperable assumed-shape, assumed-rank,
allocatable, or pointer data object is the C address of the Fortran
descriptor of the actual argument. If the procedure referenced is a C
function, the corresponding formal parameter shall be a pointer to
type void.

C struct definitions, C function prototypes, and the definitions of
constants needed for a C function to interoperate with an interface
that has assumed-shape, assumed-rank, allocatable, or data pointer
dummy arguments are contained in a file named
ISO_Fortran_binding.h. This file is supplied as part of the Fortran
processor and shall be available to the companion C preprocessor.


Seven functions are provided for use in C functions. These functions
and the structure of the C descriptor provide the C programmer with
the capability to interact with Fortran procedures that have
allocatable, data pointer, assumed-rank, or assumed-shape arguments.

Within a C function, allocatable objects shall be allocated or
deallocated only through execution of the CFI_allocate and
CFI_deallocate functions. Pointer objects may become associated with a
target by execution of the CFI_allocate function.

Each function returns an int value. If an error occurred during
execution of the function the returned value is nonzero; otherwise
zero is returned. Errors might occur because values supplied in an
argument are invalid for that function, or a memory allocation
failed. Which errors are detected and the corresponding return values
are not specified by this standard. Prototypes for these functions are
provided in the ISO_Fortran_binding.h file as follows:


int CFI_update_cdesc ( CFI_cdesc_t * );

   CFI_update_cdesc updates a C descriptor based on information in the
   corresponding Fortran descriptor. The Fortran descriptor is not
   modified.

int CFI_update_fdesc ( CFI_cdesc_t * );

   CFI_update_fdesc creates or updates a Fortran descriptor based on
   information in the corresponding C descriptor. The C descriptor is
   not modified.  If the address of the Fortran descriptor is NULL,
   then a new Fortran descriptor is allocated using malloc.

int CFI_allocate ( CFI_cdesc_t *, const CFI_bounds_t bounds[] );

   CFI_allocate allocates memory for an object using the same
   mechanism as the Fortran ALLOCATE statement. On entry, the base
   address in the C descriptor shall be NULL. The corresponding
   Fortran descriptor shall be for an unallocated allocatable or
   disassociated pointer data object. The supplied bounds override any
   current dimension information in the descriptors. The stride values
   are ignored and assumed to be one. Both the Fortran and C
   descriptors are updated by this function.

int CFI_deallocate   ( CFI_cdesc_t * );

   CFI_deallocate deallocates memory for an object that was allocated
   using the same mechanism as the Fortran DEALLOCATE statement. On
   entry, the base address in the C descriptor shall not be NULL.  The
   corresponding Fortran descriptor shall be for the same object and
   shall be for an allocated allocatable object, or a pointer
   associated with a target that was allocated using CFI_allocate or
   the Fortran ALLOCATE statement. Both the Fortran and C descriptors
   are updated by this function.

int CFI_is_contiguous ( const CFI_cdesc_t *, _Bool * result);

   CFI_is_contiguous defines result as true if the object described by
   the C descriptor is contiguous in memory, and false otherwise. If
   the object is allocatable it shall be allocated. If it is a pointer
   it shall be associated.

int CFI_bounds_to_cdesc ( const CFI_bounds_t bounds[], CFI_cdesc_t * );

   CFI_bounds_to_cdesc computes a set of extent and stride multiplier
   values in a C descriptor given a corresponding set of lower bound,
   upper bound, and stride values in the bounds array. The lower
   bounds in the C descriptor become those in the input bounds
   array. Since computation of stride multipliers requires the element
   size, the whole C descriptor is used as one of the arguments. If
   there is a corresponding Fortran descriptor, it is updated to
   reflect the same bounds, extend, and stride multiplier information.

int CFI_cdesc_to_bounds ( const CFI_cdesc_t *, CFI_bounds_t bounds[] );

   CFI_cdesc_to_bounds compute a set of upper bounds and stride values
   based on the extent and stride multiplier values in a C descriptor.
   The lower bounds in the bounds array become those in the input C
   descriptor. Since computation of strides from stride multipliers
   requires the element size, the whole C descriptor is used as one of
   the arguments.


The struct of type CFI_bounds_t is used to hold bounds and stride
information for one dimension of an array. It is defined in the file
ISO_Fortran_binding.h, and contains these components:

lower_bound - type intptr_t, equal to the value of the lower bound of
              an array for a specified dimension.

upper_bound - type intptr_t, equal to the value of the upper bound of
              an array for a specified dimension.

stride - type intptr_t, equal to the difference between the subscript
         values of consecutive elements of an array along a
         specified dimension.


The base address in the C descriptor for a data pointer may be
modified by assignment and that change later affected in the
corresponding Fortran descriptor by the CFI_update_fdesc function.
The base address in the C descriptor for an allocatable object may be
initialized to NULL and its value shall be modified only by the
CFI_allocate or CFI_deallocate functions. If the base address of an
object that is neither a data pointer nor an allocatable object is
changed from its initial value, the corresponding Fortran descriptor
shall not be modified.

It is possible for a C function to acquire memory through a library
function like malloc and associate that memory with a data pointer in
a C descriptor. A C descriptor associated with such memory shall not
be supplied as an argument to CFI_deallocate and a corresponding dummy
argument in a called Fortran procedure shall not be specified in a
context that would cause the dummy argument to be deallocated. The
memory may be released by reference to the free library function in a
C function.

If a Fortran descriptor is created by a C function, the memory for the
descriptor may be released by a reference to the free library function
in a C function when the descriptor is no longer needed.


Specification for a RANK inquiry function.
------------------------------------------

In Table 13.1:

RANK         (A)        I        Rank of a data object.

Following the RANGE intrinsic in 13.7:

13.7.136a  RANK (A)

Description: Rank of a data object.

Class: Inquiry function.

Argument:  A  shall be a data object of any type.

Result Characteristics: Default integer scalar.

Result value: The result is the rank of A.

Example: For an array X declared REAL :: X(:,:,:), RANK(X) is 3.


===========================

Examples:

Example of TYPE (*) for an abstracted MPI routine with two
arguments. The first argument is a data buffer of type (void *) and
the second is an integer indicating the size of the buffer.  The
generic interface allows for both 4 and 8 byte integers, as a solution
to the "-i8" compiler switch problem.

In C:  void MPI_xxx ( void * buffer, int n);

In the Fortran MPI module:

interface MPI_xxx
   subroutine MPI_xxx (buffer, n) bind(c,name="MPI_xxx")
      type(*),dimension(*) :: buffer
      integer(c_int),value :: n
   end subroutine MPI_xxx
   module procedure MPI_xxx_i8
end interface MPI_xxx

...

subroutine MPI_xxx_i8 (buffer, n)
   type(*),dimension(*) :: buffer
   integer(8) :: n
   call MPI_xxx(buffer, int(n,c_int))
end subroutine MPI_xxx_i8

-----------------------
Example of assumed-type and assumed-rank for an abstracted
MPI_send routine.

In C:  void MPI_send ( void * buffer, int n);
       void MPI_send_new ( void * buffer_desc);

In the Fortran MPI module:

interface MPI_send
   subroutine MPI_send_old (buffer, n) bind(c,name="MPI_send")
      type(*), dimension(*) :: buffer ! Passed by simple address
      integer(c_int),value :: n
   end subroutine
   subroutine MPI_send_new (buffer) bind(c,name="MPI_send_new")
      type(*), dimension(..), contiguous :: buffer
         ! Passed by descriptor including the shape and type
   end subroutine
end interface

real :: x(100), y(10,10)

! These will invoke MPI_send_old
call MPI_send(x,size(x)) ! Passed by address
call MPI_send(y,size(y)) ! Sequence association
call MPI_send(y(:,1),size(y,dim=1)) ! Pass first column of y
call MPI_send(y(1,5),size(y,dim=1)) ! Pass fifth column of y

! These will invoke MPI_send_new
call MPI_send(x) ! Pass a rank-1 descriptor
call MPI_send(y) ! Pass a rank-0 descriptor
call MPI_send(y(:,1)) ! Passed by descriptor without copy
call MPI_send(y(1,5)) ! Illegal: No sequence association

--------------------

It is possible to "cast" a TYPE (*) object to a usable type, exactly
as is done for void * objects in C. For example, this code fragment
casts a block of memory to be used as an integer array.


subroutine process(block, nbytes)
   type(*), target :: block(*)
   integer, intent(in) :: nbytes ! Number of bytes in block(*)

   integer :: nelems
   integer, pointer :: usable(:)

   nelems=nbytes/(bit_size(usable)/8)
   call c_f_pointer (c_loc(block), usable, [nelems] )
   usable=0 ! Instead of the disallowed block=0
end subroutine


--------------------
Assumed-rank variables are not restricted to be assumed-type.
For example, many of the procedures in Clause 14 could be written
using an assumed-rank dummy argument instead of writing 16 separate
specific routines for each possible rank.

An example of an assumed-rank dummy argument for the specific
procedures for a Clause 14 function.

interface ieee_support_divide
    module procedure ieee_support_divide_noarg
    module procedure ieee_support_divide_onearg_r4
    module procedure ieee_support_divide_onearg_r8
end interface ieee_support_divide

...

logical function ieee_support_divide_noarg ()
    ieee_support_divide_noarg = .true.
end function ieee_support_divide_onearg_r4

logical function ieee_support_divide_onearg_r4 (x)
    real(4),dimension(..) :: x
    ieee_support_divide_onearg_r4 = .true.
end function ieee_support_divide_onearg_r4

logical function ieee_support_divide_onearg_r8 (x)
    real(8),dimension(..) :: x
    ieee_support_divide_onearg_r8 = .true.
end function ieee_support_divide_onearg_r8
