   Paper N2103 is F2008 Corrigendum 4 with line numbers;  Notes for WG5:

     Edits included in this document from the interpretations in N2042,
     N2062, N2086 and N2092 as amended by N2047, N2080, N2087, N2093,
     N2094 and N2102:

       f08/0099 to f08/0104, f08/0106, f08/0108, f08/0109, f08/0112,
       f08/0113, f08/0115 to f08/0124, f08/0126, f08/0127, f08/0129
       to f08/0137, f08/0139 to f08/0145, f08/0147, f08/0148.

     Interpretations from N2042, N2062, N2086 and N2092 approved without
     generating edits:

       f03/0042, f08/0099, f08/0105, f08/0108, f08/0138.

     Two interpretations (f08/0110 and f08/0128) from this group of
     documents were withdrawn and returned to J3 for further
     consideration. Some changes were made to the text of the balloted
     interpretations without affecting the resulting edits.

     Page and line numbers on the right refer to 10-007r1. They, the
     interpretation references and notes in italics are for WG5 use only
     and will be deleted before the document is submitted to ISO.

   Paper N2098 contains the defect reports that led to Corrigendum 4
   and responses to those defect reports

   /J3

   The business of the meeting is completed.

5.2 Closing business

5.3 Review of action items

   1) Stan Whitlock will send the J3 minutes 16-169 to Lynn Barra
      (lbarra@itic.org)

   2) Malcolm Cohen is planning to have a new 16-007r1 by mid-April, 2016

   3) For the next meeting (m210, Boulder, June, 2016), we will
      move to A/B/C groups for reviewing the draft: 

        Group A (JoR):  Chapter 13 - Annex C
        Group B (Data): Introduction - Chapter 7
        Group C (HPC):  Chapters 8 - 12

        All edits should be against 16-007r1

        Everyone should look for processor dependencies not in the
        Introduction and should be critical of the content of Annex C

      Some instructions from the editor:

        (1) editing instructions should give the whole subclause heading
            and paragraph number (you can say "same subclause" if it's the
            same as the previous edit)
        (2) when moving/deleting, please include the first few and last
            few words of the text to be moved/deleted
        (3) NOTEs are not numbered in the source so they also need
            context and/or contents
        (4) BNF rules should give the name not just the number

        This will help the editor to work efficiently and reduce the
        likelihood of an editing mistake

5.4 Future meetings

   210  June 6-10, 2016, WG5 joint meeting in Boulder, Co, USA

5.6 Closing membership report

   Paper 15-001r1 of meeting 206 is the latest membership roster.
   It is posted on the J3 web site in the members area.

   Total Membership at beginning of Meeting 209   9
   Majority [1 over half]                         5

   Total Members Attended or Represented at 209   9
   Total Attendees at Meeting 209                11

   Membership changes since last meeting:

     No one is in jeopardy of losing membership because of attendance
     at the end of this meeting.

     No one is in jeopardy of losing membership because of Letter ballot
     non-participation.

   Craig Rasmussen has paid dues to be a member of PL22.3.  The next
   meeting he attends would be his observer meeting.  Malcolm Cohen has
   been named an alternate for Craig;  this meeting m209 counts as
   Malcolm's observer meeting so Craig will be a voting member of PL22.3
   at the m210 meeting and Malcolm will be his alternate, eligible to
   move/second/vote in Craig's stead.

5.7 Comments from members

   The group expressed its thanks to the host, Tom Clune.

   No other comments were recorded.
