3. Edits to 09-007
------------------

[73:14] In the last sentence of C480 in 4.5.6 "Final subroutines",
        replace "not have INTENT(OUT)"
        with "not have the INTENT(OUT) or VALUE attribute".
{F03/0094.}

[156:19(7.2.1.3p3)] Insert new sentence at beginning of paragraph
  "If <variable> is an unallocated allocatable array, <expr> shall
   have the same rank as <variable>."
{F03/0093.}

NOte to editor: [156:19-24] and in [156:21-24] edit below, should we
change "the variable" to "<variable>"?

[156:21-24(7.2.1.3p3)] Replace last sentence of paragraph
  "If the variable is or becomes an unallocated allocatable variable,
   then it is allocated with each deferred type parameter equal to the
   corresponding type parameter of <expr>, with the shape of <expr>, with
   each lower bound equal to the corresponding element of LBOUND(<expr>),
   and if the variable is polymorphic, with the same dynamic type as
   <expr>."
to
  "If the variable is or becomes an unallocated allocatable variable,
   it is then allocated with
    - if the variable is polymorphic, the same dynamic type as <expr>,
    - each deferred type parameter equal to the corresponding type
      parameter of <expr>,
    - if the variable is an array and <expr> is scalar, the same
      bounds as before, and
    - if <expr> is an array, the shape of <expr> with each lower bound
      equal to the corresponding element of LBOUND(<expr>)."
{F03/0093.}

[162:18-19(7.2.2.4p6) Replace "If <proc-target> ... shall have" with
  "If <proc-pointer-object> is a function with an implicit interface,
   <proc-target> shall be a function with"
{Paragraph 3 already requires ALL the characteristics be the same for the
 "pointer has an explicit interface" case, so we only need to specify the
 situation for the "pointer has an implicit interface" case.  That case
 ***does not allow CLASS(*) anyway***.  Thus removing the unwanted
 redundancy fixes the problem identified by the interp.}
{F03/0092.}

[223:30+(9.6.4.3p6+)] Between p6 and Note 9.49 insert new paragraphs:
  "During the execution of an output statement that specifies an
   internal file, no part of that internal file shall be referenced,
   defined, or become undefined as the result of evaluating any output
   list item.

   During the execution of an input statement that specifies an
   internal file, no part of that internal file shall be defined or
   become undefined as the result of transferring a value to any
   input list item."
{F03/0050.}

[238:21(9.10.2.9 DIRECT=)] At the end of the last sentence, insert
  "or if the unit identified by <file-unit-number> is not connected to a
   file".
{F03/0106.  In this and other edits, "specified by UNIT=" in the interp has
 become "identified by <file-unit-number>", because the former is incorrect
 when the optional UNIT= syntax is omitted.}

[238:27(9.10.2.10 ENCODING=)]
  After "unable to determine the encoding form of the file"
  insert "or if the unit identified by <file-unit-number> is not connected
          to a file".
{F03/0106.}

[239:5(9.10.2.13 FORMATTED=)] At the end of the last sentence, insert
  "or if the unit identified by <file-unit-number> is not connected to a
   file".
{F03/0106.}

Changes to NEXTREC= unnecessary because it already handles the condition.

[239:24-25 (9.10.2.18 NUMBER=)] Replace paragraph with
  "Execution of an INQUIRE by file statement causes the
   <scalar-int-variable> in the NUMBER= specifier to be assigned the value
   of the external unit number of the unit that is connected to the file.
   If there is no unit connected to the file, the value -1 is assigned.
   Execution of an INQUIRE by unit statement causes the
   <scalar-int-variable> to be assigned the value of <file-unit-number>."
{F03/0106.}

[240:19(9.10.2.22)] Before "the file is not connected"
  		    insert "there is no connection,",
		    After "for stream access" insert comma.
{F03/0106, reworded; for connection properties "no connection" is clearly
 better wording.}

[240:34(9.10.2.24 READ=)] Add to the end of the last sentence
  "or if the unit identified by <file-unit-number> is not connected to a
   file".
{F03/0106.}

[241:5(9.10.2.25 READWRITE=)] Add to the end of the last sentence
  "or if the unit identified by <file-unit-number> is not connected to a
   file".
{F03/0106.}

[241:23(9.10.2.28 SEQUENTIAL=)] Add to the end of the last sentence
  "or if the unit identified by <file-unit-number> is not connected to a
   file".
{F03/0106.}

[241:31(9.10.2.30 SIZE=)] After "determined" insert
  "or if the unit identified by <file-unit-number> is not connected to a
   file".
{F03/0106.}

[241:40(9.10.2.31 STREAM=)] Add to the end of the last sentence
  "or if the unit identified by <file-unit-number> is not connected to a
   file".
{F03/0106.}

[242:5(9.10.2.32 UNFORMATTED=)] Add to the end of the last sentence
  "or if the unit identified by <file-unit-number> is not connected to a
   file".
{F03/0106.}

[242:10(9.10.2.33 WRITE=)] Add to the end of the last sentence
  "or if the unit identified by <file-unit-number> is not connected to a
   file".
{F03/0106.}

[253:24+ (10.7.2.1, at the end)] Insert new list item
  "(7) On output of a real zero value, the digits in the exponent field
       shall all be zero."
{F03/0079.}

[267:5(10.10.4)] Append to paragraph
  "The form of the values produced by defined output (9.6.4.7) is
   determined by the defined output procedure; this form need not be
   compatible with list-directed input."
{F03/0101, reworded.
 9.6.4.7 is \ref{D9:User-defined derived-type input/output}.
 Hyperlink "defined output" to "defined input/output".}

[268:25(10.11.2p3)] Replace whole paragraph with
  "A value separator for namelist formatting is a value separator
   for list-directed formatting (10.10), or one or more contiguous
   blanks between a nonblank value and the following object
   designator or "!" comment initiator."
{F03/0097.}

[272:3,6(10.11.4.1p1)]
  After "output produced" insert "by intrinsic namelist output",
  Append to paragraph
    "The form of the output produced by defined output (9.6.4.7) is
     determined by defined output procedure; this form need not be
     compatible with namelist input."
{F03/0101, reworded.
 9.6.4.7 is \ref{D9:User-defined derived-type input/output}.
 Hyperlink "defined output" to "defined input/output".}

[310:10-11(12.6.2.1 C1245)] Replace constraint with
 "C1245 An elemental procedure shall not have the BIND attribute.".
{F03/0086.}

[413:26-27(14.10.3p1)] After "elemental functions for" insert "all",
		       Delete "for which ... are true".
{F03/0107.}

[Nowhere] The interp requests insertion of an excessively large note in
	  F2008 explaining the answer with a suggested implementation
	  technique.  Do not add this note in F2008.
{F03/0107.}

[439:13-14(15.3.4p2)]
  After "with a C struct type" change "if" to "if and only if",
  Delete "the derived-type definition of",
  Change "specified BIND(C)" to "has the BIND attribute".
{F03/0089.
 After the interp edit the requirement is (we believe) broken: prior to that
 edit we allowed an intrinsic module to provide derived types that would
 interoperate with C struct types, but the interp answer makes no mention
 of any deliberate disallowance of this possibility.  (A derived type in an
 intrinsic module does not have a derived-type definition, but might
 nonetheless have the BIND attribute.)  Anyway, we use "BIND attribute" in
 all the constraints immediately preceding, so do not use different language
 here.}
