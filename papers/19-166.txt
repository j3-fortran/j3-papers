Subject: Preliminary specifications for parameterized modules

Parameterized modules are one proposed method to support generic
programming.  Preliminary specifications for a parameterized module
facility are described herein.

Specifications
==============

1. A Parameterized module shall declare parameter names in its initial
statement.  Two obvious syntax possibilities are to use a MODULE
statment with parenthesized lists of names after the word MODULE or
after the module name.

2. The category of each parameter shall be declared within the module.
Declarations might be within a block so identified, or that a
declaration applies to a module parameter could be deduced from the
statement, or the declared name.

Categories include

  A. Types
       examples:  TYPE, <some-word[-and-attribs]> :: <parameter-name>
             e.g. TYPE, SPEC, PUBLIC :: <parameter-name>
              or: TYPE SPEC, PUBLIC :: <parameter-name>
       or simply: TYPE, PUBLIC :: <parameter-name>
  B. Constants
       example: PARAMETER :: <parameter-name>
                any type of constant actual parameter allowed.
            or: <declaration-type-spec>, PARAMETER :: <parameter-name>
                Only specified type of actual parameter allowed;
                [part of] <declaration-type-spec> might be a module
                parameter name.
       The value for a constant parameter cannot be specified within the
       parameterized module; the syntax is different from an ordinary
       named constant declaration.
  C. Variables
       example:
        <declaration-type-spec> :: <parameter-name> [ ( <array-spec> ) ]
  D. Procedures
       The PROCEDURE statement is probably adequate for this
       declaration.  Although a PROCEDURE statement without a type spec
       or interface is ambiguous whether the declared procedure is a
       subroutine or a function, this might be the desired effect.
       Although it cannot specify that a procedure is a function without
       specifying at least its result type, it could specify a type that
       depends upon a module parameter, or specify an interface having
       details that depend upon module parameters.
  E. Modules (parameterized or otherwise)
       example: MODULE :: <parameter-name>
            or: MODULE NAME :: <parameter-name>

3. Whether and how submodules can be parameterized can be decided in due
course.

4. Whether a parameterized module can only be an independent program
unit, or can be defined within another program unit, can be decided in
due course.

5. Parameterized modules are explicitly instantiated, and can only be
instantiated within some other program unit.  As is the case for
accessing a non-parameterized module by use association, the instance
does not access the module in which it is instantiated by host
association.  The processor's internal representation of an
instantiation ought to bear a strong resemblance to the result of
reading an ordinary (non-parameterized) module from a .mod file.  The
result can be considered to be an "internal module" from which entities
can then be accessed by use association.  Whether instantiation and
access are performed by the same statement, or instantiation is
performed by one statement and access is performed by other statements,
can be decided in due course.

If a parameterized module is instantiated within the specification part
of a module, the resulting internal module ought to be accessible by use
association from the module in which it is instantiated, and then
entities within it can be accessed by use association, from within the
scoping unit wherein the instance is accessed.

6. It is necessary to allow a parameterized module to instantiate other
parameterized modules during its instantiation.  This allows to
construct composite objects.  Instantiation cycles must, of course, be
forbidden.

Observations concerning parameterized modules
=============================================

As Malcolm pointed out at meeting 218, complete semantic checking of
parameterized modules, templates, or macros cannot be carried out until
instantiation.

With the appropriate scheme of parameter declaration, however, some
semantic checking of parameterized modules can be done before
instantiation.  This checking is sharp in one direction only.  It could
discover that there is no way to instantiate the module, but it cannot
guarantee that an instantiation will be semantically correct.  For
example, if a module parameter is declared to be a type and its name
appears within an expression, the module cannot be instantiated.  If it
is declared to be a constant and it appears in a variable-definition
context, the module cannot be instantiated.  The processor need not wait
until an attempt to instantiate the module to announce these kinds of
errors.

Difference from macros
======================

If the categories of macro arguments are not declared, the rudimentary
semantic checking possible for parameterized modules cannot be done.
The processor cannot announce that there is no way to expand the macro
to produce a semantically correct result.

Difference from templates
=========================

Templates in C++ are automatically instantiated, and the processor keeps
a database to eliminate duplicates.  The frequent complaint about a
request for a new feature is that it imposes a cost on implementers.
The C++ way of doing templates would impose a much larger cost than
macros or parameterized modules.

Examples
========

These are not extended edits for Annex C!  Only one simple example.

  module Sorts ( TheType )
    type, spec :: theType ! When instantiated, actual parameter shall be
                          ! a type name or type name with parameters
    generic :: Sort => TheSort
  contains
    subroutine TheSort ( A )
      type(theType), intent(inout) :: A(:)
      ! Assumes theType is integer, real, character, or a derived type
      ! with a type-bound <= operator.
      !...
    end subroutine TheSort
    ! The following is an error that would prevent the module from being
    ! instantiated: This could be detected when this program unit is
    ! analyzed, before any instantiations.
!   subroutine Junk ( X, Y )
!     real, intent(in) :: X, Y
!     print *, 42 * theType + cos(x) - sqrt(y) ! OOPS!  TheType is not
!                                              ! a data object!
!   end subroutine Junk
  end module Sorts

  module MyData
    type, public :: Data_t
      ! ...
    contains
      procedure :: LEQ
      generic :: operator(<=) => LEQ
      procedure :: Sort ! accessed from Sorts or MySort
    end type Data_t
    ! Notice USE statements after a type definition.  Statement
    ! ordering rules need to be modified, or different statements
    ! invented to instantiate, and access instantiations.

    ! Instantiate the module, creating an internal module named MySort...:
    use mySort => sorts ( data_t ) ! Instantiate only, instance named
                                   ! MySort
    ... and access the created internal module by use association:
    use mySort, only: Data_t_Sort => Sort

    ! Alternative that instantiates the module and accesses every public
    ! entity:
!   use Sorts ( data_t ) ! Instantiates and accesses the module
!   use Sorts ( 42 ) ! an error because 42 is not a type spec
  end module MyData

  module CharacterStuff
    use CharacterSort => sorts ( character(len=*) )
  end module CharacterStuff

  program Foo
    use MyData, only: Data_t, Sort
    ! Access character instantiation of Sorts parameterized module:
    use CharacterStuff, only: CharacterSort
    ! Access character sort routine from instantiation of Sorts that
    ! previous USE statement accessed from CharacterStuff module
    use CharacterSort, only: Sort
    ! Or Sorts could be instantiated twice here if MyData and
    ! CharacterStuff aren't needed in any other program unit
    type ( Data_t ), allocatable :: TheData(:)
    character(len=127), allocatable :: OtherStuff(:)
    ! Read TheData and OtherStuff
    ! ...
    call sort ( theData )
    call sort ( otherStuff )
    ! blah blah blah
  end program Foo

Example illustrating alternative to kind-parameterized type
===========================================================

  module Interpolation ( RK )
    integer, parameter :: RK ! Actual parameter shall be named constant
    private
    public :: RK

    type, public :: Coefficients
      real(rk), allocatable :: A(:), B(:) ! Linear interpolation
      real(rk), allocatable :: C(:), D(:) ! additional for splines
    contains
      procedure :: Setup_Coefficients
      procedure :: Interpolate_Using_Setup
      procedure :: Teardown_Coefficients
    end type Coefficients

    public :: Interpolate_One_Kind ! In case somebody wants to use it
                                   ! as an actual argument

    generic, public :: Interpolate => Interpolate_One_Kind

!   type(rk) :: Junk ! OOPS: RK is not a type spec

  contains

    subroutine Setup_Coefficients ( Coeffs, Old_X, New_X, Method )
      class(coefficients), intent(out) :: Coeffs
      real(rk), intent(in) :: Old_X(:), New_X(:)
      character, intent(in) :: Method ! Begs for enumeration type
      ! Calculate coefficients for linear interpolation
      allocate ( a(size(new_x)), b(size(new_x)) )
      ! ...
      ! Calculate coefficients for spline interpolation
      if ( method == 's' .or. method == 'S' ) &
        & allocate ( c(size(new_x)), d(size(new_x)) )
      ! ...
    end subroutine Setup_Coefficients

    subroutine Interpolate_One_Kind ( Old_X, Old_Y, New_X, New_Y )
      real(rk), intent(in) :: Old_X(:), Old_Y(:), New_X(:)
      real(rk), intent(out) :: New_Y(:)
      type(coefficients) :: Coeffs
      call coeffs%setup_coefficients ( old_x, new_x )
      call coeffs%interpolate_using_setup ( old_y, new_y )
      call coeffs%teardown_coefficients ! Not really necessary
    end subroutine Interpolate_One_Kind

    subroutine Interpolate_Using_Setup ( Coeffs, Old_Y, New_Y )
      class(coefficients), intent(in) :: Coeffs
      real(rk), intent(in) :: Old_Y(:)
      real(rk), intent(in) :: New_Y(:)
      ! ...
      if ( allocated ( coeffs%c) ) then
        ! Additional stuff for spline interpolation
      end if
    end subroutine Interpolate_Using_Setup

    subroutine Teardown_Coefficients ( Coeffs )
      class(coefficients), intent(out) :: Coeffs ! deallocates everything
    end subroutine Teardown_Coefficients

  end module Interpolation

  module Model_Interpolators
    use Interpolation(kind(0.0e0)), only: Coeffs_s => Coefficients
    use Interpolation(kind(0.0d0)), only: Coeffs_d => Coefficients
  end module Model_Interpolators

or use something like a Macro DO to iterate over all real kinds
specified in ISO_Fortran_ENV:

  module Model_Interpolators
    use, intrinsic :: ISO_Fortran_Env, only: Real_Kinds
    @@DO @I = 1, size(real_kinds)
      use Interpolation(real_kinds(@i)), only: Coeffs_@string(@i) => &
        & Coefficients, Interpolate
    @@END DO
  end module Model_Interpolators

If Coefficients were a kind-parameterized derived type, it would be
necessary to create type-bound procedures for each expected kind.  If
one then declared an object of type(coefficients(...)) with an
unexpected kind, for which no type-bound procedures had been created,
and a type-bound procedure were referenced using that object, the
program would not compile.  This might occur long after a "library" had
been distributed.

Using a parameterized module, properly written, guarantees that there
will always be type bound procedures that correspond to the type.

Richard Maine remarked about this failure to integrate type-bound
procedures and parameterized types approximately twenty years ago.  That
remark was one reason why 04-153 and 04-383r1 were proposed.
