Subject: WG9 woes with SC22 and ISO
Date: 2019-February-06

This is a message from Pat Rogers, who is convenor of WG9 (Ada):

We likely have a problem. I have been talking with David Keaton, the SC 
22 chair, and Michaela Moore, the SC 22 Secretariat, about the next 
revision. Both are new to their roles although David has been an SC 22 
member for some time. I don't know Michaela's history.

As far as David can see, there is no documentation of the special 
arrangement Ada has always had with ISO. None whatsoever. The SC 22 
history books don't mention it at all. As a result neither Michaela nor 
David knew what I was talking about.

They can see that the document is publicly available and that the
copyright is different, for example, but they don't have any
substantiation that we have always produced the document externally
and then submitted it to ISO for approval. They can see that we used the 
Fast Track process last time but absent some proof of Ada's differences 
that is going to be a problem this time.

David is not averse to the whole idea, if we can document it, but in her 
role Michaela is more bound by the rules. We need to substantiate the 
fact that there is a long-standing, different arrangement for Ada.

I asked David's predecessor (Rex J.) but he was not in that role during 
Ada 2012 and had no knowledge of it. David said he will try to track 
down Rex's predecessor but he was not confident that he could find him.

I'm now reaching out to all of you to see if any of you can shed any 
light for them, with a history of who agreed to what, and when.

I've also asked Jim Moore and Stephen Michelle for substantiation info 
and history.

Please let me know if you can provide useful info, as soon as possible.
