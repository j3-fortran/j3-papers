Subject:  Fix up Intro (again)

Specifically, the description of inheritance & extends/extensible
is very awkward.  Better language should be provided.  This is
an attempt to do so.

The edits are modified from 01-350 to accommodate the objections
of Richard Maine in 01-382.

Edits are relative to 01-007R4

EDITS

[xiii:14-15] Replace
