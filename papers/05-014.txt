1. Introduction
===============

This contains the combined edits from all passed papers at m173, plus
the "enhanced module" TR 19767, plus the editor's report thereof 05-169
(the latter changes some edits and deletes others).

Some typos in the papers have been corrected in this list.
Some comments appear.

All edits appear in page and line number order.

There will not be a combined document with them separated out into
"feature" order; refer to the original papers for that information.

  "8.1.6.4a Restrictions on DO CONCURRENT constructs

   A statement in the loop range shall not cause a branch out of the construct.

   A variable that is referenced in an iteration shall either be previously
   defined during that iteration, or shall be defined or become undefined
   during any other iteration of the current execution of the construct.  A
   variable that is defined or becomes undefined by more than one iteration of
   the current execution of the construct becomes undefined when the current
   execution of the construct terminates.

   A pointer that is referenced in an iteration either shall be previously
   pointer associated during that iteration, or shall not have its pointer
   association changed during any iteration. A pointer that has its pointer
   association changed in more than one iteration has a processor dependent
   association status when the construct terminates.

   An allocatable object that is allocated in more than one iteration shall be
   subsequently deallocated during the same iteration in which it was
   allocated. An object that is allocated or deallocated in only one iteration
   shall not be deallocated, allocated, referenced, or become undefined in a
   different iteration.

   An input/output statement shall not write data to a file record or position
   in one iteration and read from the same record or position in a different
   iteration of the same execution of the construct.

   Records written by output statements in the loop range to a sequential
   access file appear in the file in an indeterminate order.

   Procedures referenced in the loop range shall be PURE.  If the
   IEEE_EXCEPTIONS intrinsic module is accessible, calls to the IEEE_GET_FLAG,
   IEEE_SET_HALTING_MODE, and IEEE_GET_HALTING_MODE subroutines shall not
   appear in the loop range.

   Note 8.15a
   The restrictions on referencing variables defined in an iteration of a DO
   CONCURRENT construct apply to any procedure invoked within the loop.
   [end Note]

   Note 8.15b
   The restrictions on the statements in the loop range of a DO CONCURRENT
   construct are designed to ensure there are no data dependencies between
   iterations of the loop.  This permits code optimizations that might
   otherwise be difficult or impossible because they would depend on
   characteristics of the program not visible to the compiler.

   The following example represents a case in which the user knows that
   the elements of the array IND form a permutation of the integers 1..N.
   The DO CONCURRENT construct will allow the compiler to generate vector
   gather/scatter code, unroll the loop, or parallelize the code for this
   loop, significantly improving performance.

  "13.7.35a EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE(COMMAND [, WAIT, EXITSTAT, CMDSTAT, CMDMSG ])
   Description.  Execute the command line specified by the string COMMAND.  If
                 the processor supports command line execution, it shall
                 support synchronous and may support asynchronous execution
                 of the command line.
   Class.  Subroutine.
   Arguments.
   COMMAND         shall be of type default character and shall be a scalar.
                   It is an INTENT(IN) argument.  Its value is the command line
                   to be executed.  The interpretation is processor-dependent.
   WAIT (optional) shall be of type default logical and shall be a scalar.  It
                   is an INTENT(IN) argument.  If WAIT is present with the
                   value false, and the processor supports asynchronous
                   execution of the external command, the command is executed
                   asynchronously; otherwise it is executed synchronously.
  EXITSTAT (optional) shall be of type default integer and shall be a scalar.
                      It is an INTENT(INOUT) argument.  If the command is
                      executed synchronously, it is assigned the value of the
                      processor-dependent exit status.  Otherwise, the value of
                      EXITSTAT is unchanged.
  CMDSTAT (optional)  shall be of type default integer and shall be a scalar.
                      It is an INTENT(OUT) argument.  It is assigned the value
                      -1 if the processor does not support command line
                      execution, a processor-dependent positive value if an
                      error condition occurs, or the value -2 if no error
                      condition occurs but WAIT is present with the value false
                      and the processor does not support asynchronous
                      execution.  Otherwise it is assigned the value 0.
  CMDMSG (optional)   shall be of type default character and shall be a scalar.
                      It is an INTENT(INOUT) argument.  If an error condition
                      occurs, it is assigned a processor-dependent explanatory
                      message.  Otherwise, it is unchanged.

  When the command is executed synchronously, EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE returns
  after the command line has completed execution.  Otherwise,
  EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE returns without waiting.

  If an error occurs and CMDSTAT is not present, execution of the
  program is terminated."
