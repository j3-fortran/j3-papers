X3J3 Response to WG5 Dresden Resolutions
(Reference: X3J3/96-123, Dresden Resolutions)

D4. Maintenance Procedures for Fortran 95
X3J3 concurs with the process outlined in this resolution and agrees to accept defect item submissions from any WG5 member body and the WG5 convenor.

D5. Handling Floating Point Exceptions
X3J3 concurs with progressing this Technical Report to the PDTR stage.

D6. Interoperability with C
After further technical analysis (96-119, 96-145), a majority of X3J3 believes that the MAP_TO functionality not be included in this Technical Report; a substantial minority disagrees.

D7. Enhanced Data Type Facilities
X3J3 concurs with progressing this Technical Report, with the indicated change of scope, to the PDTR stage.

D8. Conditional Compilation as Part 3 of the Standard
X3J3 concurs with making a conditional compilation facility Part 3 of the Fortran standard.  However, X3J3 opposes submitting a draft to SC22 at this time and requests WG5 to continue refining the content as indicated by resolution D9.

D9. Form of Conditional Compilation
A majority of X3J3 concurs with making the conditional compilation part “Fortran-like” rather than “cpp-like”; a substantial minority disagrees.

D10. Interval Arithmetic
A majority of X3J3 concurs with making Interval Arithmetic a Fortran 2000 requirement; a substantial minority disagrees.

D11. Parameterized Derived Types
A majority of X3J3 concurs with making parameterized derived types a Fortran 2000 requirement; a substantial minority disagrees.

D13. Schedule and Content of Fortran 2000
X3J3 concurs with the Fortran 2000 schedule as specified in this resolution and the Fortran 2000 content as specified in WG5-N1215. To this end X3J3 progressed several minor technical items to the specification/syntax stage at the August 1996 X3J3 meeting, with only detailed edits remaining to be done for these items. For the five firm requirements, progress was made toward establishing the specs for derived-type I/O (96-148), specs were finalized for asynchronous I/O (96-147r1), specs were established for procedure pointers (96-142 -- this route was taken rather than procedure variables), interval arithmetic was discussed in some detail, and specs were finalized for parameterized derived types (96-141r1). From the discussions on interval arithmetic it appears clear that this requirement cannot be met with derived types and modules, even if certain deficiencies in the abstraction mechanism are removed; moreover, there was considerable discussion regarding making interval arithmetic optional rather than mandatory in Fortran 2000.

D14. Development of Fortran 2000 Requirements
X3J3 would be most happy to delegate development activities to individuals and groups not directly associated with X3J3, will actively seek such assistance, and welcomes WG5 suggestions for delegation opportunities.

D15. Future meetings
X3J3 concurs with the WG5 meeting schedule outlined in this resolution, hereby officially invites WG5 to meet jointly with X3J3 in the US in February 1997, and requests its chair to work with the WG5 convenor in developing an agenda for this joint meeting. X3J3 expects that decisions regarding the tentative joint meeting in 1998 to be made after the 1997 joint meeting.
