VI. Wednesday, November 12, 2025 -- 6:00PM - 9:00PM EST (UTC-5)
    (Meeting also known as "237-Extension")
----------------------------------------------------------
   1. Plenary - subgroup heads
/Preprocessing
**Motion 25-176r2 "Formal specifications for macro identification and
       expansion in the Fortran preprocessor"[Fasano,Bonachea](Fasano/Johnson)

Straw poll 1
------------
How should fixed source form be handled in forthcoming syntax/edit
papers for preprocessing?

OPTION A: Fixed source form preprocessing should be fully
          specified, and support is just as mandatory as free-form
          preprocessing.     4

OPTION B: Fixed source form preprocessing should have recommendations
          but be explicitly labeled as optional because of fixed-form
          obsolescence.      5

OPTION C: Nothing should be specified about preprocessing for fixed
          source form, which means preprocessing for fixed source form
          remains entirely processor-dependent (as it is today). The
          edits should explicitly note that preprocessing of fixed
          source form is processor-dependent.  9
Undecided        2

Straw poll 2
------------
Should it be mandatory to explicitly continue lines inside the argument
list for the invocation of a function-like macro?

OPTION R: Explicit Fortran-style continuation is required to continue
          lines within the argument list of a function-like macro
          invocation. If a function-like macro invocation begins on one
          line and the closing ')' needed to close the argument list
          does not appear on the same line, then Fortran-style
          continuation syntax must be used to mark the continuation,
          otherwise the processor may consider this an error.  11

OPTION O: Explicit Fortran-style continuation is permitted, but not
          required, to continue lines within the argument list of a
          function-like macro invocation. If a function-like macro
          invocation begins on one line and the closing ')' needed to
          close the argument list does not appear on the same line, the
          processor will continue looking for the closing ')' on
          subsequent source fragment lines, even without explicit
          continuation syntax. 4
Undecided: 5
