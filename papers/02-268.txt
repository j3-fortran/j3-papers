62:22 (TECHNICAL CHANGE). Add 'Each <type-parameter-value> shall be an 
initialization expression.'
[We would have problems, for example, with TYPEALIAS :: TR => T(M,N).]

64:12+6. Change to
   ENUM, BIND(C) :: PRIMARY_COLORS
[To make the end of this note correct.]

70:32. Change 'declared with a POINTER or an' to 'that has the POINTER or'.

106:7. Before 'object' add 'declared type of the'. 
[Originally in 02-242 – avoids an ambiguity.]

355:21. Change 'features' to 'FEATURES'.

422:1. Change 'IN' to 'In'.
