Discussion:
-----------


General:
--------

To accommodate the improvements proposed later for specific
collective subroutines, the general definition and description of
collective subroutines needs to be changed as follows:

1) In 4.1.1, replace "assigns the value of the result to all of them"
to "assigns the value of the result on one or all of them.  [Purpose:
This allows for the new RESULT_TEAM argument that specifies which
image gets the result.]

2) Remove the final sentence of 4.1.1: "There is an implicit team
synchronization at the beginning and end of the execution of a
collective subroutine." [Purpose: Allow for better performance,
particularly in the case of only one image getting the result.]

3) Because a collective subroutine is no longer an image control
statement (segment boundary), there is no implicit SYNC MEMORY, and
we need to place an additional restriction on TEAM variables: "A
variable that appears as the TEAM argument in a collective subroutine
shall not be otherwise defined or become undefined in the same segment
except as the TEAM argument to another collective subroutine."
[Purpose: This ensures that the team data structure will not be
corrupted during execution of a collective subroutine by means other
than another collective subroutine. Collective subroutines themselves
will check an internal lock to ensure non-colliding use of the team
data structure.]

Specific routines:
------------------

The currently proposed collection of 10 collective subroutines in
11-176 (CO_ALL, CO_ANY, CO_COUNT, CO_FINDLOC, CO_MAXLOC, CO_MAXVAL,
CO_MINLOC, CO_MINVAL, CO_PRODUCT, and CO_SUM) simply mirror the
reduction routines in Fortran 2008. Many of these are of little
significance in actual usage for cross-image reductions.  After
examining the frequency of MPI reduction operations in a collection of
benchmark codes, this set is proposed as a replacement:

CO_BCAST  - a collective broadcast
CO_MAX    - maximum value
CO_MIN    - minimum value
CO_REDUCE - reduction by a user-specified function
CO_SUM    - SUM reduction

The SUM and BCAST operations were the most common, followed by
MAX/MIN. The CO_REDUCE routine is included as a general replacement
for all other reduction operations.

The currently proposed collective subroutines lack some features that
would improve its usability and improve performance. The new versions
have these enhancements:

1) The RESULT variable is optional. If it is not present, the result
of the computation is assigned to the SOURCE argument.  [Rationale:
The current specification requires declaring a second variable to be
used for the RESULT, which is often unnecessary.]

2) SOURCE, and RESULT if present, are allowed to be
non-coarrays. [Rationale: This significantly expands the potential
usability of the routine, particularly in the context of integrating
coarrays into existing codes. Internally, the routine could have a
coarray of a derived type with a component that is a pointer to the
supplied SOURCE or RESULT argument, and perform the computation using
that structure. As an optimization, for the case of scalar argument,
the routine could have an internal coarray into which the source is
copied at entry and from which the result is copied at completion.]

3) Add a new optional argument, RESULT_IMAGE. If this is present, the
result is assigned only on the identified image, and not broadcast to
all the images. On all other images, the result variable becomes
undefined.  [Rationale: This is a reasonably common usage, and
eliminating the broadcast improves performance.]



Edits to J3/11-176:
--------------------


[1:16] In the definition of collective subroutine replace "on all" by
"on one or all".

[9:4-7] Replace the text of 4.1.1 Collective subroutine by:

"A collective subroutine is one that is invoked on a team of images to
perform a calculation on those images and which assigns the value of
the result on one or all of them. If it is invoked by one image of a
team, it shall be invoked by the same statement on all images of the
team."

[9:9-15] Replace the text of 4.1.2 Arguments to collective subroutines
by

"Each actual argument of type IMAGE_TEAM to a collective subroutine
shall have
a value constructed by an invocation of FORM_TEAM for the team on that
image. Each actual argument to a collective subroutine shall have
the same bounds, cobounds, and type parameters as the corresponding
actual argument on any other image of the team. It shall not be
otherwise defined or become undefined in the
same segment except as an actual argument to another collective
subroutine.

On any two images of the team, the ultimate arguments for each dummy
argument corresponding to a coarray actual argument shall be
corresponding coarrays as described in 2.4.7 of ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010."

[9:19+ - 10:1-] In Table 4.1, replace the first 10 entries (CO_ALL
though CO_SUM) by these entries:

"CO_BCAST  (SOURCE, SOURCE_IMAGE   C   Broadcast of a value to
            [, TEAM])                  all images of a team.


 CO_MAX    (SOURCE [, RESULT,      C   Maximum value of elements
            TEAM, RESULT_IMAGE])       on a team of images.

 CO_MIN    (SOURCE [, RESULT,      C   Minimum value of elements
            TEAM, RESULT_IMAGE])       on a team of images.

 CO_REDUCE (SOURCE, OPERATION      C   General reduction of elements
            [, RESULT, TEAM,           on a team of images.
            RESULT_IMAGE])

 CO_SUM    (SOURCE [, RESULT,      C   Sum elements on a team
            TEAM, RESULT_IMAGE])       of images."


[10:2 - 14:31] Replace 4.3.1 through 4.3.10 by these five subclauses:

"4.3.1 CO_BCAST (SOURCE, SOURCE_IMAGE [, TEAM])

Description. Broadcast of a value to all images of a team.

Class. Collective subroutine.

Arguments.

SOURCE shall be a coarray. It is an INTENT(INOUT) argument. SOURCE
becomes defined on all images of the team with the value of SOURCE on
image SOURCE_IMAGE.

SOURCE_IMAGE shall be type integer. It is an INTENT(IN) argument. Its
value shall be the image index of one of the images in the team.

TEAM (optional) shall be a scalar of type IMAGE_TEAM. It is an
INTENT(IN) argument that specifies the team for which the broadcast is
performed. If TEAM is not present, the team consists of all images.


Example. If SOURCE is the array [1, 5, 3] on image one, after
execution of CALL CO_BCAST(SOURCE,1) the value of SOURCE on all images
is [1, 5, 3].


4.3.2 CO_MAX (SOURCE [, RESULT, TEAM, RESULT_IMAGE])

Description. Maximum value of elements on a team of images.

Class. Collective subroutine.

Arguments.

SOURCE shall be of type integer, real, or character. It is an
INTENT(INOUT) argument. If it is a
scalar, the computation result is equal to the maximum value of SOURCE
on all images of the team. If it is an array, the value of the
computation result is equal to the maximum value of all the
corresponding elements of SOURCE on the images of the team. If RESULT
is not present, value of the computation result is assigned to
SOURCE. If REULT is present, SOURCE is not modified.

RESULT (optional) shall be of the same type, type parameters, and
shape as SOURCE. It is an INTENT(OUT) argument. If RESULT is present,
the value of the computation result is assigned to RESULT.

TEAM (optional) shall be a scalar of type IMAGE_TEAM(4.4.2). It is an
INTENT(IN) argument that specifies the team for which CO_MAX is
performed. If TEAM is not present, the team consists of all images.

RESULT_IMAGE (optional) shall be type integer. It is an INTENT(IN)
argument. Its value shall be the image number of one of the images in
the team. If RESULT_IMAGE is present and RESULT is present, the result
of the computation is assigned to RESULT on image RESULT_IMAGE and
RESULT on all other images becomes undefined. If RESULT_IMAGE is
present and RESULT is not present, the result of the computation is
assigned to SOURCE on image RESULT_IMAGE and SOURCE on all other
images becomes undefined.

Example. If the number of images is two and SOURCE is the array [1, 5,
3] on one image and [4, 1, 6] on the other image, the value of RESULT
after executing the statement CALL CO_MAX(SOURCE, RESULT) is [4,5,6].


4.3.3 CO_MIN (SOURCE [, RESULT, TEAM, RESULT_IMAGE])

Description. Minimum value of elements on a team of images.

Class. Collective subroutine.

Arguments.

SOURCE shall be of type integer, real, or character. It is an
INTENT(INOUT) argument. If it is a
scalar, the computation result is equal to the minimum value of SOURCE
on all images of the team. If it is an array, the value of the
computation result is equal to the minimum value of all the
corresponding elements of SOURCE on the images of the team. If RESULT
is not present, value of the computation result is assigned to
SOURCE. If REULT is present, SOURCE is not modified.

RESULT (optional) shall be of the same type, type parameters, and
shape as SOURCE. It is an INTENT(OUT) argument. If RESULT is present,
the value of the computation result is assigned to RESULT.

TEAM (optional) shall be a scalar of type IMAGE_TEAM(4.4.2). It is an
INTENT(IN) argument that specifies the team for which CO_MIN is
performed. If TEAM is not present, the team consists of all images.

RESULT_IMAGE (optional) shall be type integer. It is an INTENT(IN)
argument. Its value shall be the image number of one of the images in
the team. If RESULT_IMAGE is present and RESULT is present, the result
of the computation is assigned to RESULT on image RESULT_IMAGE and
RESULT on all other images becomes undefined. If RESULT_IMAGE is
present and RESULT is not present, the result of the computation is
assigned to SOURCE on image RESULT_IMAGE and SOURCE on all other
images becomes undefined.

Example. If the number of images is two and SOURCE is the array [1, 5,
3] on one image and [4, 1, 6] on the other image, the value of RESULT
after executing the statement CALL CO_MIN(SOURCE, RESULT) is [1,1,3].


4.3.4 CO_REDUCE (SOURCE, OPERATION [, RESULT, TEAM, RESULT_IMAGE])

Description. General reduction of elements on a team of images.

Class. Collective subroutine.

Arguments.

SOURCE is an INTENT(INOUT) argument.
If it is a scalar, the computation result is the value that would
be obtained by applying the function specified by the OPERATION argument
to the results of applying the collective subroutine on a
processor-dependent team that is part of the given team and another team
that is the rest of the given team. If it is an array, the computation
result is equal to a processor-dependent and image-dependent application
of the collective subroutine on all the corresponding elements
of SOURCE on the images of the team. If RESULT is not present, the value
of the computation result is assigned to SOURCE. If RESULT is present,
SOURCE is not modified.

OPERATION shall be a pure function that defines the binary,
commutative operation to be performed. The function shall
have two arguments of the same type, type parameters, and rank as
SOURCE. If they are arrays, they shall be of assumed shape. The result
shall have the same type and type parameters as SOURCE and the same
shape as the first argument. If the arguments are arrays, the result
of applying the function to corresponding sections of two arrays shall
be the same as the corresponding section of the result of applying the
function to the wholes of the two arrays.

RESULT (optional) shall be of the same type, type parameters, and
shape as SOURCE. It is an INTENT(OUT) argument. If RESULT is present,
the value of the computation result is assigned to RESULT.

TEAM (optional) shall be a scalar of type IMAGE_TEAM(4.4.2). It is an
INTENT(IN) argument that specifies the team for which CO_SUM is
performed. If TEAM is not present, the team consists of all images.

RESULT_IMAGE (optional) shall be type integer. It is an INTENT(IN)
argument. Its value shall be the image number of one of the images in
the team. If RESULT_IMAGE is present and RESULT is present, the result
of the computation is assigned to RESULT on image RESULT_IMAGE and
RESULT on all other images becomes undefined. If RESULT_IMAGE is
present and RESULT is not present, the result of the computation is
assigned to SOURCE on image RESULT_IMAGE and SOURCE on all other
images becomes undefined.

Example. If the number of images is two and SOURCE is the array [1, 5,
3] on one image and [4, 1, 6] on the other image, and MyADD is a
function that returns the sum of its two integer arguments, the value
of RESULT after executing the statement CALL CO_REDUCE(SOURCE, MyADD,
RESULT) is [5,6,9].


4.3.5 CO_SUM (SOURCE [, RESULT, TEAM, RESULT_IMAGE])

Description. Sum elements on a team of images.

Class. Collective subroutine.

Arguments.

SOURCE shall be of numeric type. It is an INTENT(INOUT) argument.
If it is a scalar, the computation result
is equal to a processor-dependent and image-dependent approximation to
the sum of the value of SOURCE on all images of the team. If it is an
array, the value of the computation result is equal to a
processor-dependent and image-dependent approximation to the sum of
all the corresponding elements of SOURCE on the images of the team. If
RESULT is not present, value of the computation the result is assigned to
SOURCE. If RESULT is present, SOURCE is not modified.

RESULT (optional) shall be of the same type, type parameters, and
shape as SOURCE. It is an INTENT(OUT) argument. If RESULT is present,
the value of the computation result is assigned to RESULT.

TEAM (optional) shall be a scalar of type IMAGE_TEAM(4.4.2). It is an
INTENT(IN) argument that specifies the team for which CO_SUM is
performed. If TEAM is not present, the team consists of all images.

RESULT_IMAGE (optional) shall be type integer. It is an INTENT(IN)
argument. Its value shall be the image number of one of the images in
the team. If RESULT_IMAGE is present and RESULT is present, the result
of the computation is assigned to RESULT on image RESULT_IMAGE and
RESULT on all other images becomes undefined. If RESULT_IMAGE is
present and RESULT is not present, the result of the computation is
assigned to SOURCE on image RESULT_IMAGE and SOURCE on all other
images becomes undefined.

Example. If the number of images is two and SOURCE is the array [1, 5,
3] on one image and [4, 1, 6] on the other image, the value of RESULT
after executing the statement CALL CO_SUM(SOURCE, RESULT) is [5,6,9]."
