77:25. Delete 'also'. 
[It is confusing since the previous paragraph applies to both implicit
and explicit declaration of the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute.]

77:26+. Add
   An object may have the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute in a particular
   scoping unit without necessarily having it in other scoping units.
   If an object has the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute then all of its
   subobjects also have the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute.  
[This is said for VOLATILE (86:6-8). I think it is equally necessary
for ASYNCHRONOUS.]

78:0+2. After ')' add 'while the scoping unit is in execution'.

191:14-18. Change paragraph to
   A pending input/output storage sequence <<affector>> is a variable of
   which any part is associated with a storage unit in a pending
   input/output storage sequence.  
[I struggled for hours to work out what the old paragraph was trying to
say. I have come to the conclusion that it is an old draft text that is
now superseded by 5.1.2.3 (p. 77).  The intent of the second sentence
is covered by my edit for 77:26+. The only other place where 'affector'
is used in on p. 196, where my suggested meaning seems to fit perfectly.]

196:35&38. Change 'accessibility or association' to 'pointer
association'.  [Accessibility is a static property and I think
'association' must refer to 'pointer association'.]
