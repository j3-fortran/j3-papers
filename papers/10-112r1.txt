DISCUSSION

The difference between SYNC IMAGES and SYNC ALL should be clarified.


EDIT

[190:15+]In 8.5.4 "SYNC IMAGES statement" at the end of Note 8.37, add

"When the following example runs on five or more images, each image
synchronizes with both of its neighbors, in a circular fashion.

INTEGER :: up, down

IF (NUM_IMAGES()>1) THEN
   up   = THIS_IMAGE()+1; IF (up>NUM_IMAGES()) up = 1
   down = THIS_IMAGE()-1; IF (down==0) down = NUM_IMAGES()
   SYNC IMAGES ( (/ up, down /) )
END IF

This might appear to have the same effect as SYNC ALL but there is no
ordering between the preceding and succeeding segments on non-adjacent
images. For example, the segment preceding the SYNC IMAGES statement
on image 3 will be ordered before those succeeding it on images 2 and 4,
but not those on images 1 and 5."
