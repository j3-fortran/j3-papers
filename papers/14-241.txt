Subject:   Interpretation about pointer subobjects of type LOCK_TYPE
Date: 2014 October 02
Reference: 10-007r1, 14-139r2, 14-172, 14-215 part 3.4, 14-231/N2027

14-172 was submitted at meeting 204 as a work item, was moved by Long,
seconded by Lionel, and accepted with unanimous consent.  Then it was
decided that its application to LOCK_TYPE ought to be processed as an
interpretation (see 14-215 part 3.4). Its edit to 14-007r1 was not
included in 14-007r2, but its edit to 14-130, concerning EVENT_TYPE, was
included in 14-231/N2027 (draft of TS 18508).  14-139r3, which covers
related ground, was accepted and incorporated into 14-007r2.  The
changes therein that are related to the distinction between pointer
association and variable association are included here.  Whether they
should be included in a corrigendum can be decided in due course.

QUESTION:

Does the following conform to the Fortran 2008 standard?

  type :: T
    type(lock_type), pointer :: P = NULL()
  end type T

  type(t), parameter :: N = t(null())
  type(t) :: V
  type(lock_type), target :: L

1 nullify ( v%p )

2 v%p => l

3 v = n

ANSWER:

Constraint C1303 prohibits a variable of type LOCK_TYPE from appearing
in a variable definition context, with a few exceptions that do not
include statements 1 and 2.  Subclause 16.6.7 specifies that the
appearance of a variable as a <pointer-object> in a <nullify-stmt>, or
as a <data- pointer-object> or <proc-pointer-object> in a <pointer-
assignment-stmt>, is a variable association context.  Therefore
statements 1 and 2 do not conform to the Fortran 2008 standard.

The appearance of a <pointer-object> in a <nullify-stmt>, or of a <data-
pointer-object> or <proc-pointer-object> in a <pointer-assignment-stmt>,
are pointer association contexts, and are listed as such in subclause
16.6.8; they ought not to be listed as variable definition contexts in
subclause 16.6.7.

{The above proposition was advocated in 14-139r3, accepted at meeting
204, and incorporated into 14-007r2.  Therefore, statements 1 and 2 will
conform to the next revision of the Fortran standard.  Whether
statements 1 and 2 ought to be included in the present question can be
decided in due course.}

Constraint C1304 prohibits a variable with a subobject of type LOCK_TYPE
from appearing in a variable definition context, with a few exceptions
that do not include statement 3.  Therefore statement 3 does not conform
to the Fortran 2008 standard.

{The proposition that the prohibition should only apply to variables
that have nonpointer subobjects of the type EVENT_TYPE being developed
in TS 18508 was accepted, and incorporated into 14-231/N2027.}

Statements 1-3 are harmless, and ought to be permitted.  Edits are
provided to correct this.

EDITS:

[399:22 C1304] Insert "nonpointer" before "subobject".

{A change parallel to this, concerning EVENT_TYPE, is already
incorporated in 14-231/N2027.}

EDITS already applied in 14-007r2:

[312:33+ C1283(1)+] Insert a list item

  "(1a) in a pointer association context (16.6.8),"

{This is a knock-on effect due to deleting pointer association contexts
from the list of variable definition contexts.  It recovers items (2),
(3) and (12) from 16.6.7p1, which are deleted below.}

[313:1-2 C1283(5)]  Delete "with INTENT(OUT) or INTENT(INOUT)" from item
(6) because it is covered by 16.6.7p1(12).

[456:44-45 16.6.7p1(2-3)] Delete list items (2) and (3) because they are
not variable definition contexts, and do not apply to nonpointer
variables.

[445:11 16.6.7p1(12)] Append "is not a pointer and" after "dummy
argument", because an actual argument pointer corresponding to a dummy
argument pointer is not a variable definition context, and doesn't apply
to nonpointer variables.
