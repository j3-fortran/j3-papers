000030     Ordering requirements on definition of specification functions

  Rob James' NO comment on 000030:

    The proposed interpretation is too restrictive.  One could imagine a
    situation in which a user might want to use a generic interface to
    specify bounds for array dummy arguments for module procedures.  The
    user would then be restricted to putting the specific procedures for
    that generic immediately after the module's specification part.  This
    restriction would seem very arbitrary to the user.  Take the following
    example:

    module mod1
      interface dummy_extent
        module procedure integer_dummy_extent
        module procedure real_dummy_extent
      end interface
    contains

      subroutine do_something(a)
        integer :: a(dummy_extent(0))
        ...
      end subroutine

      subroutine do_another_thing(b)
        real :: b(dummy_extent(0.0))
        ...
      end subroutine

      ! For procedures in this module, we know that all integer dummy
      ! arrays will have extent 10 and all real dummy arrays will have
      ! extent 5, so let's provide procedures so that we don't have to
      ! remember those numbers specifically.  And while we're at it,
      ! we might as well put them in an out-of-the-way place at the
      ! bottom of the module.
      pure function integer_dummy_extent(x)
        integer :: integer_dummy_extent, x
        integer_dummy_extent = 10
      end function
      pure function real_dummy_extent(x)
        real :: real_dummy_extent, x
        real_dummy_extent = 5
      end function

    end module

000074     TARGET dummy arguments and POINTER expressions

  Rob James' YES comment on 000074:

    I believe that the example given should ideally be
    standard-conforming, but I agree with the interpretation in that I
    don't think we should be kludging this functionality into the current
    standard.  For the next revision of the standard, I believe that we
    should try to make this example standard-conforming.

  Van Snyder's NO comment on 000074:

   The reasoning for the answer to Interpretation 74 is flawed.  The
    conclusion cannot be support by the cited passages.

    The first justification given, from 12.5.2.1, is that "A dummy data
    object whose intent is not specified is subject to the limitations of
    the data entity that is the associated actual argument.  That is, a
    reference to the dummy data object may occur if the actual argument
    is defined and the dummy data object may be defined if the actual
    argument is definable."

    The reasoning continues "Here the actual argument is a function
    result, which is not definable."

    The quote is accurate, but the conclusion is wrong because the
    quoted passage has nothing to do with the question:  The actual
    argument is not the function result; it is the target of the function
    result.  See [269:20-22] in the DIS ([200:30-32] in F95):

      "If the dummy argument is not a pointer and the corresponding
      actual argument is a pointer, the actual argument shall be
      associated with a target and the dummy argument becomes argument
      associated with that target."

    Similarly, the reasoning for question 2:

      "The call to s2 is not standard conforming. 12.4.1.1 says:

        'If a dummy argument has INTENT(OUT) or INTENT(INOUT), the actual
        argument shall be definable.'

      "Again the actual argument is a function result, which is not
       definable."

    is not probitive, because the actual argument is in fact not a
    function result.  That is, the quoted passage cannot logically be
    used to support the conclusion.

    Consider the following program

      program P
        real, target :: A = 42.0
        real, pointer :: P
        p => a
        call s ( f(p) )
     contains
        subroutine S ( X )
          real :: X ! or INTENT(OUT) or INTENT(INOUT)
          print *, x
        end subroutine S
        function F ( Y )
          real, pointer :: F
          real, pointer :: Y
          f => y
        end function F
      end program P

    It is clear that A is pointer associated with P.  The dummy argument
    Y of the function F is argument associated with P, not with A.  The
    result of F is a pointer associated with A, not A itself.  The
    result of F is a pointer associated with A.  X is not a pointer.
    Therefore, the actual argument of S is the target of P, that is, A,
    which is NOT the result of F.  That is, the actual argument is not
    the result of F.

    The conclusion should be

      "This program is standard conforming.  The actual argument is not
      the result of the function F, but rather the target of the result
      of F.  It is the target of the result of F that is argument
      associated with the dummy arguments of S1, S2 and S3.  See
      12.4.1.1:

        'If the dummy argument is not a pointer and the corresponding
        actual argument is a pointer, the actual argument shall be
        associated with a target and the dummy argument becomes argument
        associated with that target.'

      "Therefore the passage from 12.5.2.1:

        'A dummy data object whose intent is not specified is subject to
        the limitations of the data entity that is the associated actual
        argument.  That is, a reference to the dummy data object may occur
        if the actual argument is defined and the dummy data object may
        be defined if the actual argument is definable.' 

      does not apply.

      "If a pointer is associated with a data entity, that is, if it has a
      target, its target is definable.  Therefore, since the data entity
      that is the actual argument of S1 or S2 is definable, the dummy
      arguments of S1 and S2 are definable."

    That the target of the function result is the actual argument should
    be obvious from the following embellishment of the above program:

      program P
        real, target :: A = 42.0
        real, pointer :: P1, P2, P3
        p1 => a
        p2 => f(p1)
        print *, associated(p1,p2) ! Prints "T"
        print *, p1, p2            ! Prints "42.0 42.0"
        call s ( p1 )    ! Obviously permitted.  Target of P1 is actual arg.
        call s ( p2 )    ! Obviously permitted.  Target of P2 is actual arg.
       call s ( f(p1) ) ! The bone of contention
      contains
        subroutine S ( X )
          real :: X ! or INTENT(OUT) or INTENT(INOUT)
          print *, x
        end subroutine S
        function F ( Y )
          real, pointer :: F
          real, pointer :: Y
          f => y
        end function F
      end program P

    Richard Maine has lectured us for many years about the distinction
    between a pointer and its target.  His lessons are particularly
    germane here.

    I agree that no edits are needed for interpretation 74.

000102     mask-expr evaluated only once

  Rob James' NO comment on 000102:

    I don't believe that the first edit is correct.  It applies to a
    WHERE, not an ELSEWHERE.  For a WHERE, I believe that evaluation of
    the mask expression is necessary if the WHERE is executed.  I do
    agree, however, that it is not necessary to evaluate the mask
    expression of an ELSEWHERE in all situations.

000104     Representation method of result of REAL

  Van Snyder's NO comment on 000104:

    The reasoning for the answer to Interpretation 104 is flawed.  The
    conclusion cannot be support by the cited passages.  The answer does
    not address the questions.

    The cited passage from subclause 1.4, viz.

      "This standard does not specify ...
      (6) The physical properties of the representation of quantities
      and the method of rounding, approximating, or computing numeric
      values on a particular processor, ...."

    is not germane to the cardinality of the correspondence between kind
    and representation.  The germane subclause is 4.3.1.2:

      "A processor shall provide two or more approximation methods that  
      define sets of values for data of type real.  Each such method has
      a representation method and is characterized by a value for a type
      parameter called the kind type parameter."

    This specifies that there is ONE representation method and ONE kind
    type parameter value for each approximation method.   The cited
    passage from subclause 1.4 says that a processor is free to choose
    what EACH representation method is, and how crappy the arithmetic
    can be.  It does not contradict the assertion in 4.3.1.2 that each
    approximation method corresponds to exactly ONE representation
    method, and it therefore cannot be used to support the conclusion
    that several representation methods are allowed for the result of a
    function, depending on the context of an appearance of a reference
    to it, or the whim of the processor.  The "logic" applied to this
    interpretation, resting solely on item (6) from 1.4, could be
    construed to allow the result of DBLE(0.1e0) to have the same
    representation as 0.1e0.  This is clearly undesirable, especially
    where the function result is an actual argument, and illustrates
    the absurdity of the conclusion.

    It may be viewed as an unfortunate consequence of a conspiracy of
    7.1.4.2 and 4.3.1.2 that the sorts of exceedingly useful
    optimizations that processors commonly do are prohibited, in
    particular, that they are apparently prohibited to use an
    intermediate result in a floating-point register if that register
    has a different representation method from constants or variables
    of the kind demanded by 7.1.4.2.  The edits proposed in 04-283
    were intended explicitly to allow multiple representations for
    intermediate expression results, but not for the results of the
    REAL and CMPLX intrinsic functions, so as to make these obviously
    useful optimizations legal.

    We need to reason from what the standard says, not backward from
    the desired result using faulty logic to justify it.  If the
    standard cannot support what we want it to support, it has to be
    amended; we cannot wish away difficulties by using irrelevant
    quotations.
