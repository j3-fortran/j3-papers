One aspect of polymorphism that is a potential source of controversy was 
revealed during recent discussions of the data subgroup. This aspect 
involves what are often known as multimethods. Multimethods can take two 
or more actual arguments of a polymorphic type. The most simple (and 
commonly occurring) example of multimethods are simple binary methods, 
which have only two arguments, both of the same polymorphic type. This 
paper will focus on simple binary methods as sufficient to illustrate 
the problems. It is considered likely that a solution to the binary 
method problem will provide strong guidance to the general solution. 

The current proposal for object oriented Fortran has polymorphism 
strongly tied to inheritence, with the resolution of method dispatch 
determined by the type of one of the arguments (single dispatch). The 
use of single dispatch causes no problems when only one of the arguments 
is of a polymorphic type. Problems can arise when more than one argument 
can be of a polymorphic type, because the proper method to be selected 
can, in principle, depend on all such arguments. There are a number of 
ways of addressing this problem most of which are not immediately 
relevant for Fortran. However, interested readers can refer to the paper 
of Bruce et. al. "On Binary Methods", (Ref. 1)

A simple example of the type of problems multimethods can invoke is 
given below in pseudo-OOF code

   TYPE, EXTENSIBLE :: POINT1D ! Defines a polymorphic type
      REAL :: X
   END TYPE

   SUBROUTINE EXAMPLE(A, B) ! A binary method that calls another
                            ! binary method
      TYPE(POINT1D) :: A    ! Determines the dispatching object
      TYPE(POINT1D) :: B    ! Has the type of A in some sense
      IF (A .EQ. B) THEN    ! The equality operator is the
                            ! simplest possible binary method
         WRITE (*,*) 'A and B are equal'
      ELSE
         WRITE (*,*) 'A and B are not equal'
      END IF
   END SUBROUTINE EXAMPLE

   TYPE, POINT2D, EXTENDS(POINT1D)  
      REAL :: X
   END TYPE ! EXAMPLE is not overridden.

The preceding code raises the following questions:

1. Should code such as SUBROUTINE EXAMPLE be allowed by the language for 
extensible types? If not what does that imply for the default equality 
operator?

2. If code such as SUBROUTINE EXAMPLE is allowed, what should be the 
default requirements on D for

   CALL EXAMPLE(C, D)

when C and D are declared with polymorphic type POINT1D and and at 
runtime C has the specific type POINT2D, i.e., must D have the specific 
type POINT1D or POINT2D? (Note: Ada requires D to have the type POINT2D 
and it does not cause problems. I believe C++ and its relatives either 
forbid this syntax or require D to have type POINT1D. Other options are 
known to either be type unsafe (e.g., Eiffel's general covariance), or 
too complicated or inefficient for Fortran's user community (e.g., the 
multimethods of CLOS and Dylan.))

3. Should the language provide a specific syntax for the constraint 
implied by the decision on question 2, i.e., should the statement

      TYPE(POINT1D) :: B

in SUBROUTINE EXAMPLE above be written something like

      TYPE_OF(A) :: B ! other syntaxes might be MATCH(A)
                      ! TYPE(==A), KIND(A)

if B must have the same type as A, or

      FIXED(POINT1D) :: B ! or TYPE(POINT1D)

if B must always have the TYPE(POINT1D).

4. Should the constraint appear in the definition of EXAMPLE, or in the
procedures that call EXAMPLE, or both?

5. Should the language provide an explicit means of overriding the default
implied by the decision on question 2?
