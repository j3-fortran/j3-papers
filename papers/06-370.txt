Subject: A problem program for BIND(C) for internal procedures

Discussion:
Recent discussion on the J3 mailing list concerned the possibility
of allowing BIND(C) for internal procedures.   Some may
consider this a matter of integration work in Fortran 2008.  But to the
extent that this requires new implementation efforts, it should also
be considered feature creep.

The purpose of this note is to spell out an expensive case which
implementors will need to face if the feature is permitted, and suggest
a way for the standard to supply the functionality without so great an expense.


% cat t1.f90
RECURSIVE FUNCTION factorial(n)
USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_C_BINDING , ONLY : C_FUNLOC

INTEGER factorial, n

INTERFACE
SUBROUTINE c_trace(p) BIND(C)
USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_C_BINDING, ONLY : C_FUNPTR
TYPE(C_FUNPTR), VALUE :: p
END SUBROUTINE
END INTERFACE

CALL c_trace(C_FUNLOC(ftrace))
IF (n .eq. 0) THEN
   factorial = 1
ELSE
   factorial = n * factorial(n - 1)
END IF
CONTAINS
     SUBROUTINE ftrace()  BIND(C)    ! assume this is allowed and marks this routine as interoperable
     PRINT *, 'Invoked factorial with argument ',n
     END SUBROUTINE
END FUNCTION factorial

INTEGER i, factorial
i = factorial(1) ; PRINT *, 'factorial(1)=',i
i = factorial(2) ; PRINT *, 'factorial(2)=',i
i = factorial(3) ; PRINT *, 'factorial(3)=',i
i = factorial(4) ; PRINT *, 'factorial(4)=',i
END

% cat t2.c
#include <stdio.h>
void
c_trace(void (*p)(void))
{
    /* Assume that p() prints trace information */
    printf("0x%X: ", p);
    p();
}

If this program is run by a standard f90 processor together
with a companion C processor,
one might expect c_trace to be called 10 times with a function
pointer argument.  When calling the function through the
pointer argument, the function (which is a Fortran internal subroutine)
will need the value n=1 from four different host instances of factorial, the
value n=2 from three more different host instances, the value
n=3 from two more different host instances, and the value
n=4 from an additional host instance.    An implementation based on
dynamic code generation of trampolines would need to add 10 such
trampolines/wrappers to handle the 5-line main program above !
An implementation based on expecting C function pointers to contain more than
just a C address might make too many demands on its companion processor
or rule out too many potential companion processors.

Such disproportionate effort is not required.  J3 could permit
a wider variety of implementations of the same user functionality
(interoperability of internal procedures with C) by
introducing the concept of closures.  Here's a first attempt to show the flavor.
If this is considered feature creep it would be possible to wait
until the next revision of the standard.

1) Introduce the type C_CLOSURE to intrinsic module ISO_C_BINDING.
        TYPE(C_CLOSURE) can be used to construct an interface
        that interoperates with a C prototype which has 2 corresponding
        pointer arguments, the first being a function pointer and
        the second being a "static display pointer" of type "void *".
        An object of type C_CLOSURE is called a closure.

        NOTE: It might be helpful, although it is not specifically required,
        to think of a closure as having exactly two components , one pointing to
        code and one pointing to a host instance.  Procedure pointers are
        already required to have a concept of a host instance, see [318:1-3].

        A Fortran procedure interface is interoperable with a C function prototype if
        (1) the interface has the BIND attribute;
        ...
        (3) the number of dummy arguments of the interface is
                equal to the number of formal parameters of the prototype
                minus the number of dummy arguments of the interface of type C_CLOSURE
           In this case we will say that a dummy argument of type C_CLOSURE
                *corresponds to* two formal C parameters.
           NOTE:  A Fortran dummy argument corresponds to 1 or 2 formal C parameters.
                The number is always 1 if the dummy argument is not of type C_CLOSURE
                and is always 2 if the dummy argument is of type C_CLOSURE.
                The details of the correspondence are processor-specific.
        ...

2) Introduce function C_FUNCLOSURE to intrinsic module ISO_C_BINDING.
        It takes as argument an internal procedure
        or a procedure pointer which is pointer associated with an internal procedure.
        An internal procedure shall not be the argument to C_FUNPTR.
        C_FUNCLOSURE returns an object of type TYPE(C_CLOSURE) which describes
        the internal procedure and its current host instance.

3) Closures may be assigned to procedure pointers and procedure pointers may be
        assigned to closures by value-preserving intrinsic assignment.
        Value-preserving means that
                Y = X
                X = Y
        results in X having its original value.

4) An internal procedure is always defined by Fortran.  It is never, per se,
        interoperable.  However, it can be called by a C function through a
        C function pointer argument which interoperates with a Fortran dummy
        which is a closure describing it.  The specific C calling sequence
        is processor-dependent.

        NOTE:  The C function may or may not be required to tailor the calling
        sequence using the 2nd C formal parameter which interoperates with the
        closure.  For example, it might need to be explicitly listed as an
        argument. 
        Different companion processors may require different C code to call the
        same internal procedure defined by the same Fortran code.
