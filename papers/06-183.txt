1. Monday, May 8, 2006  8:00 AM
-------------------------------

    The J3 meeting (#176) was called to order at 8:00 AM, Monday,
    May 8, 2006, at the Emerald Suites, Las Vegas, NV, USA,
    by the J3 chair, Dan Nagle.

1.1 Opening business                              D. Nagle

    The Chairman welcomed everyone.

    The task this week is to go through the 06-010r1 document and work
    on items for Fortran 2008 that remain.  The timeline says that this
    meeting (#176) is the last meeting for new edits.  Then there are
    three meetings to integrate/polish the final document.  Then there
    is one last integration meeting.

1.1.1 Remarks from the chair                     D. Nagle

    We need to do a response to DARPA about their error processing
    requests {RTED - Run-Time Error Detection}.

1.1.2 Adoption of agenda                         D. Nagle

**  motion: Adopt the agenda as amended (moved by Dick Hendrickson/
            seconded by Stan Whitlock): passed by unanimous consent
            {uc}

1.1.3 Approval of Meeting 175 minutes            D. Nagle

**  motion: Approve paper 06-151, the minutes of meeting #175
            (Whitlock/Hendrickson): uc

1.1.4 NCITS/OMC report (if any)                  D. Nagle

    There is a new SC22 Working Group on "Vulnerability due to
    Language Features" that Dan Nagle will attend in June.  See the
    web site

      http://www.aitcnet.org/isai/Home.html

    about "ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 22/OWG:Vulnerabilities" for more info.
    Dan would like J3 to appoint him as liaison to this WG.

1.1.5 ISO/WG5 report                             Van Snyder, IR

    Nothing to report

1.1.6 J11 Liaison report (if any)                C. Rasmussen

    There was no report.

1.1.7 H2 Liaison report (if any)                 D. Nagle

    Nothing that affects Fortran;  H2 is working on the next revision
    which covers XML/SQL integration.

1.1.8 IEEE 754 report (if any)                   M. Ingrassia

    They hope to finish 754R in December.  They are trying to get
    public comment through a Wikipedia article.  They chose to
    include 2 binary formats for decimal - one better for hardware,
    one better for software.  There will be a new rounding mode:
    round to nearest but away from 0 on a tie.  There will be a new
    definition for MAX and MIN when NaNs are present.  Here is the
    URL for the draft:

      http://754r.ucbtest.org

    is a good starting place for tracking 754R activity, and contains
    a pointer to Wikipedia for those inspired to add public comment:

      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_754r

    It leaves some decisions to the language or the user.

1.1.9 Treasurer's report                         M. North

    Opening balance is $1777.94.  There is a $50 meeting fee at this
    meeting.

    Mallory reminded J3 that we need a new treasurer when he retires.
