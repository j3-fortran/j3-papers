Title: contiguous pointers
Submitted By: J3
Status: For Consideration
References: J3/04-132, J3/05-149r2

Basic Functionality:
  Provide a method to indicate that the target of a pointer or an
  actual argument is contiguous.

Rationale:
  Many unnecessary operations happen because compilers cannot
  determine that a data item occupies contiguous memory.  For
  example, contiguous memory is needed to pass an array to a
  procedure with an implicit interface. Certain optimizations are
  possible if the compiler knows that the memory stride for the
  left-most subscript is 1, or if a whole array occupies a contiguous
  memory block. Thus, the mere use of pointers often results in
  substantially suboptimal code.  If the compiler knew that the
  pointer was constrained to point to contiguous memory, very much
  better code could be generated. Similar optimization problems exist
  for assumed-shape dummy arguments.

Estimated Impact:
  The effort was estimated as 5 on the John Reid scale at M167.

Detailed Specification:
  Provide a declaration attribute, CONTIGUOUS, that specifies that
  the pointer being declared will only be associated with a target
  occupying a storage sequence or that the elements of an
  assumed-shape dummy argument occupy a storage sequence. The
  processor may need to make a contiguous copy of an actual argument
  associated with a dummy argument with the contiguous attribute.
  For example,

        real, pointer, contiguous        :: sptr(:)
        real, contiguous, dimension(:,:) :: d

  A corresponding CONTIGUOUS :: <object-name-list> statement is also
  provided.

  An intrinsic function, IS_CONTIGUOUS(A), is also provided. The argument
  is an array or array section.  The result is .true. if the argument
  occupies a storage sequence, and .false. otherwise.
