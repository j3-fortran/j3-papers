All comments (unless otherwise noted) apply to the January 2002 PDF
Version of  007.

1)          Section 13, page 277, line 3.  Replace a tautology with
current status.

Proposal:  277:3  Change "Intrinsic subroutines may be elemental" to "Some
Intrinsic subroutines are also elemental"

2)          Page 278:17, make the section title singular, there is only
one bit model

Proposal:  278:17, change "models" to "model"

3)          Page 279:23-24  The sentence is awkward and doesn't use the
correct terms.  I think the trailing "them" dangles.

Proposal:  Change 279:23-24 "The numeric manipulation and inquiry
Functions provide values related to the parameters and other constants related to them."
To  "The floating-point manipulation functions (13.5.10) and numeric
Inquiry functions (13.5.6) provide the values of the parameters and other values related to the models."

4)	Withdrawn

5)          Page 280, note 13.7  The description of BACK is untrue
(or misleading)  I'd read "indicate" to mean if it is present then the
scan is backwards.  But, it's also got to be TRUE

Proposal.  Note 13.7 Change description of BACK to "Controls whether or
not a string scan is to be from right to left (backwards)"

6)          Withdrawn

7)          Page 282:13  BIT_SIZE should go with the other numeric
inquiries; it's quite a bit like DIGITS.

Proposal Move 282:13 to just before 281:41
