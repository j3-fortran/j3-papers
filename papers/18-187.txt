Discussion
~~~~~~~~~~
Fortran 2018 has dropped the requirement that the DIM argument to
THIS_IMAGE be of default kind. But this change is not mentioned in the
list of changes in the Introduction. 

Edit
~~~~
On page xviii, in the bullet headed "Intrinsic procedures and modules",
after the sentence "In references to the intrinsic functions ALL, ANY, 
FINDLOC, IALL, IANY, IPARITY, MAXLOC, MAXVAL, MINLOC, MINVAL, NORM2,
PARITY, PRODUCT, SUM, and THIS_IMAGE, the actual argument for DIM can
be a present optional dummy argument." add a new sentence "The actual
argument DIM to THIS_IMAGE is no longer required to be of default kind.".
