Subject: Associate name clarification
Date: 2016 February 09


1. Introduction

The associate name attribute descriptions require the reader to pay too
much attention to the wording.  The readability could be better.

It should be noted at 8.1.3.3 "Other attributes of associate names" is
what it says, (the) other attributes.  8.1.3.3 is referred to separately
by ASSOCIATE, SELECT RANK, and SELECT TYPE, it does not by itself
describe all the attributes, only in combination with the references.
This situation will remain.

That an ASSOCIATE associate-name is not a pointer or allocatable can be
easily deduced from 8.1.3.2+8.1.3.3, similarly that can be deduced for a
SELECT TYPE associate name from 8.1.10.2+8.1.3.3, but it would be a little
simpler to read if we mentioned this explicitly in 8.1.3.3p1.  The
situation for a SELECT RANK associate name is different and this is
explicitly stated in 8.1.9.3 paragraph 2.

2. Edits

[173:6] 8.1.3.3 Other attributes of associate names, p1,
  Paragraph begins "Within an ASSOCIATE or SELECT TYPE construct".
  Before "has the TARGET attribute", insert
    "does not have the ALLOCATABLE or POINTER attributes, but".
Note that makes this sentence (not the whole paragraph) read
  "The associating entity does not have the ALLOCATABLE or POINTER
   attributes, but has the TARGET attribute if and only if the selector
   is a variable and has either the TARGET or POINTER attribute."
(and this applies only to ASSOCIATE and SELECT TYPE).
