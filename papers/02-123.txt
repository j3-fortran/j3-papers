Subject:  Update to 01-377  Chapter 7 comments

This is an update of 01-377 from meeting 159, which was an update of
283/R2 from meeting 158.  No action was taken at 159  I kept the
same numbering scheme as in 283 so that notes from 158 should still
be valid.

Page, etc., numbers have been updated to the current 02-007 PDF version

14)  Page 121[11-12], first sentence after note 7.13.  Is this true for
polymorphic things?  Something like
   poly_1 .operator. poly_f(poly_2 .other_operator. poly_3)

Is it the word "declared" that makes everything OK?

15)  (Continuation of previous question) Doesn't the evaluation of the
argument to poly_f in general determine the type of poly_f and hence the
type of the final expression?

16)  Page 124, 7.1.8.5, sentence after note 7.23.  Don't we need words
here like in 7.1.8.3 about mathematical and computational equivalence?
Something like:       X*Z .GT. X*Y
Becomes               X*Y - X*Z  .LT. 0
Becomes               X*(Y-Z)    .LT. 0
and this might have different round off characteristics

19)  Page 132, 7.5.1.3 intrinsic assignment statement  (2)  Should the
first line say dynamic and the last declared?  Doesn't that mix things?

20)  Page 132[18-22], 7.5.1.3 intrinsic assignment.  The last sentence
defining derived type intrinsic assignment appears to be restating
(1) and (2) above it, but the words are somewhat different.  For
example is "accessible defined assignment" in (2) different from
"no accessible generic interface ..."
For example, (2) in 7.3.2 goes into detail about where an interface may
come from and its typeboundness.  Should that apply here?  Or does "not
polymorphic" cover it?

21)  Page 132[4-6], 7.5.1.2 defined assignment.  Do we need to
distinguish details about where the interface is at ala (2) in 7.3.2
binary defined operation?

22)  Page 134[4-8], paragraph after note 7.40, the middle clause about
nonpointer, nonallocatable.  Does this mean that derived type assignment
that is NOT type bound to the host type isn't used for the innards?
Suppose I have a type PERSON with a component of type KIDS and with a
subroutine that meets the requirements for KID_1 = KID_2.  If I do
PERSON_1 = PERSON_2
does the generic subroutine every get invoked?  Does it depend on
whether or not there is a type-bound assignment interface/routine in
PERSON?  Or in KIDS?  I'm asking about an old fashioned generic
assignment and how that fits in with the new type bound stuff.
Same comment for the last couple of lines in (2) on the next page.  It
reads to me that we require "type bound procedures" when I thought
generic assignment could work.

23)  Page 135[7-10], 7.5.1.6 interp of defined assigment (2)   Says
there can be a type bound assignment procedure in EITHER X1 or X2.
What happens if there is one in both and they are different?

24)  Page 135, 7.5.2 R736  Does the second line allow something like
A%B%pointer => P or only one %?  Same question for R740

25)  Page 136[33-34], 7.5.2.1 data pointer assignment  Second
paragraph.
Does this mean a non-polymorphic pointer can point to a polymorphic
object if the types are OK?  Or should dynamic type be declared type.

26)  Page 137[16-18], 7.5.2.2 procedure pointer assignment, paragraph
after unresolved issue.  In the last two lines one of the proc-target
terms should be proc-pointer-object.  I think the second one.  Right
now it says proc-target may be elemental even if proc-target isn't.

28)  Page 139[20], 7.5.3.2 interpretation of masked array assignments
(2).
This means that the elsewhere mask expression is FULLY evaluated
without being masked out.  I think this is surprising and probably
not what we intended.  In something like
      WHERE (X  == 0 )
             ...
      ELSEWHERE ( 1/X > 10)      ! evaluated for all of X
                ...
      ENDWHERE
The same comment applies to a nested WHERE.  This came up on (I think)
the comp-f90 e-mail reflector and probably should be an F95
interpretation.
