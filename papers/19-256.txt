From: Bill Long
Subject: US-23 Part 2, Standardizing use of BOZ constants 
Date: 2019-October-16
Reference: 19-132, 19-212r1

Discussion:
-----------

Several common extensions for the usage of BOZ constants violate the
constraint 

C7109 (R764) A boz-literal-constant shall appear only as a
             data-stmt-constant in a DATA statement, or where
             explicitly allowed in 16.9 as an actual argument of an
             intrinsic procedure.

Several of the requests that lead to the proposal US-23 were actually
cases where usage of these sorts of extensions lead to nonportable
code. 

These extensions include a BOZ constant as the expr in an intrinsic
assignment where the variable is of type INTEGER or REAL.  If Table
10.8 Intrinsic assignment type conformance in 10.2.1.2 Intrinsic
assignment statement is expanded to permit BOZ constants for "Type of
expr" in the integer and real rows, then the rules in Table 10.9
Numeric conversion and the assignment statement specify the expected
interpretation since BOZ constants are already allowed as the expr
argument to both the INT and REAL intrinsics.

In addition to assignment (and the corresponding initializations of
named constants), the proposal is to allow array constructors that
include a type specification, and the appearance of BOZ constants as
I/O list items in a WRITE statement.


Requirements (from 19-212r1):
-----------------------------

Allow the following usage of BOZ constants beyond what is allowed in
C7109, as follows:

A: BOZ as an initialization in the definition of an integer named
   constant.

B: BOZ as an initialization in the definition of a real named
   constant.

C: BOZ as the expr of an intrinsic assignment to an variable of type
   INTEGER.

D: BOZ as the expr of an intrinsic assignment to an variable of type
   REAL.

E: BOZ constants that each have the same number of bits as ac-values
   with a type-spec of INTEGER.

F: BOZ constants that each have the same number of bits as ac-values
   with a type-spec of REAL. Each ac-value must have a bit sequence
   that is a valid representation for a value of the specified KIND of
   REAL.

G: BOZ constant as an output-item in a WRITE statement corresponding to
   a B, O, or Z format edit descriptor.



Specifications and syntax:
--------------------------

A: The effect of the statement

   integer,parameter :: n = Z"10101010"

   should be the same as the statement

   integer,parameter :: n = int(z"10101010",kind=kind(n))

   and the syntax and semantics restrictions that prohibit the first
   statement should be removed.

B: The effect of the statement

   real,parameter :: x = Z"40000000"

   should be the same as the statement

   integer,parameter :: x = real(z"40000000",kind=kind(x))

   and the syntax and semantics restrictions that prohibit the first
   statement should be removed.

C: The effect of the assignment statement

   integer :: n
   ...
   n = Z"10101010"

   should be the same as the statement

   n = int(z"10101010",kind=kind(n))

   and the syntax and semantics restrictions that prohibit the first
   assignment statement should be removed.

D: The effect of the assignment statement

   use,intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only: real32
   real(real32) :: x
   ...
   x = Z"40000000"

   should be the same as the statement

   x = real(z"40000000",kind=kind(x))

   and the syntax and semantics restrictions that prohibit the first
   assignment statement should be removed.


E: The effect of the array constructor in the statement

   integer(int32) :: n(4)
   ...
   n = [integer(int32) :: Z"00000001", Z"00000011", Z"000000111", &
                          Z"00001111"]

   should be the same as the array constructor in the statement

   n = [ int(Z"00000001",kind(n)), int(Z"00000011", kind(n)), &
         int(Z"00000111",kind(n)), int(Z"00001111", kind(n)) ]

   and the syntax and semantics restrictions that prohibit the array
   constructor in the first assignment statement should be removed.

F: The effect of the array constructor in the statement

   use,intrinsic :: iso_fortran_env, only: real32
   real(real32) :: x(4)
   ...
   x = [real(real32) ::  Z"40000000", Z"40400000", Z"40800000" &
                         Z"40A00000"]

   should be the same as the array constructor in the statement

   x = [ real(Z"40000000",kind(x)), real(Z"40400000", kind(x)), &
         real(Z"40800000",kind(x)), real(Z"40A00000", kind(x)) ]

   and the syntax and semantics restrictions that prohibit the array
   constructor in the first assignment statement should be removed.

   BOZ constants used as <ac-values> for array elements of type REAL
   each have the same number of bits as ac-values with a type-spec of
   REAL. Each ac-value must have a bit sequence that is a valid
   representation for a value of the specified KIND of REAL.

G: BOZ constant is allowed as an output-item in a WRITE statement
   corresponding to a B, O, or Z format edit descriptor.

   The following WRITE statements are allowed 

     write (*,"(Z8.8)")   Z"abcdef01"
     write (*,"(O12.12)") Z"abcdef01"
     write (*,"(B32.32)") Z"abcdef01"

     write (*,"(Z8.8)")   O"7654321"
     write (*,"(O12.12)") O"7654321"
     write (*,"(B32.32)") O"7654321"

     write (*,"(Z8.8)")   B"01010101"
     write (*,"(O12.12)") B"01010101"
     write (*,"(B32.32)") B"01010101"

   and produce the following output:

   ABCDEF01
   025363367401
   10101011110011011110111100000001
   001F58D1
   000007654321
   00000000000111110101100011010001
   00000055
   000000000125
   00000000000000000000000001010101

   Current restrictions that cause the code to be non-conforming are
   to be removed.



Edits:
------

[xiii] Introduction, add a new feature:

"Binary, octal, and hexadecimal literal constants may be used in more
contexts than were previously allowed"

[88:26] In 7.7 Binary, octal, and hexadecimal literal constants, in
constraint C7109 at the end of the subclause, following "in a DATA
statement," insert

" as the <initialization> for a named constant of type INTEGER or
REAL, the <expr> in an intrinsic assignment defining a variable of
type INTEGER or REAL, as an <ac-value> in an array constructor with a
<type-spec> specifying a type of INTEGER or REAL, as an
<output-list-item> in an output statement corresponding to a edit
descriptor of B, O, or Z,"

[89:5] In 7.8 Construction of array values, at the end of the second
constraint (C7111), change "Table 10.8." to "Table 10.8, or be a
<boz-literal-constant>."

[89:10+] In 7.8 Construction of array values, after the 5th constraint
(C1114) add a new constraint:

"C1114+ If an <ac-value> is a <boz-literal-constant> then <type-spec
::> shall appear and specify type INTEGER or REAL.

C1114++ If an <ac-spec> is a <boz-literal-constant> and the specified
type is REAL, each <ac-value> that is a <boz-literal-constant> shall
have a bit sequence that is a valid representation for the specified
KIND value of REAL."

[160:12] In 10.2.1.2 Intrinsic assignment statement, at the end of
list item (4) in para 1, append

" or, if the variable is type INTEGER or REAL, <expr> may be a
<boz-literal-constant>, "

[162:3] in 10.2.1.3 Interpretation of intrinsic assignments, para 8,
at the end of the paragraph, add a sentence:

"For an intrinsic assignment statement where the variable is of type
INTEGER of REAL, the <expr> can be a <boz-literal-constant>, in which
case the value of <expr> is converted to the type and kind type
parameter of the variable according to the rules of Table 10.9."

[261:38] In 13.7.2 Numeric editing, 13.7.2.1 General rules, first
paragraph, after the first sentence ending "complex data.", insert a
new sentence:

"The B, O, and Z edit descriptors can also be used to specify output
of <boz-literal-constants>."
