Subject: Editorial issue regarding binding-name in type-bound procedure
Date: 2016 May 05

Reference: 16-007r1

DESCRIPTION

4.5.5p1 (Type-bound procedures) says:

"If neither => procedure-name nor interface-name appears in a
type-bound-proc-decl, it is as though => procedure name had appeared
with a procedure name the same as the binding name."

The problem is that the rule for type-bound-proc-decl (R450) has no
place for interface-name, which goes in a type-bound-procedure-stmt
(R449). The rule for a type-bound-procedure-stmt that includes an
interface-name doesn't lead to type-bound-proc-decl, so it's impossible
for an interface-name to appear in a type-bound-proc-decl.

EDITS

[75:17-18, 4.5.5p1 Type-bound procedures]

Replace:

"If neither => procedure-name nor interface-name appears"

with:

"If => procedure-name does not appear"

so that the paragraph now reads:

"If => procedure-name does not appear in a type-bound-proc-decl,
it is as though => procedure-name had appeared with a procedure name
the same as the binding name."
