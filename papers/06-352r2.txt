Discussion:
__________

We now internal procedures to be passed as actual arguments or to be the
targets of procedure pointers. The next step in orderly and respectful
integration is to extend this to work with C Interop, that is, a
<proc-language-binding-spec> should be allowed for internal procedures,
and also such procedures should be allowed as actual arguments to C_FUNLOC.

We should spell out that an internal procedure must not be invoked after
the host instance ceases to exist.

We should not allow binding labels for internal procedures since the host
environment of the internal procedure (required in order to execute it)
may not be established until runtime (and thus not known to the linker).
This is achieved by not allowing a NAME= specifier and explaining that
there is no binding label for internal procedures.  This is similar to how
we require NAME="" to be specified for PRIVATE module procedures, instead
of saying they have no binding label.

Note that no edits are needed for C_FUNLOC: Once we allow internal
procedures to be interoperable, they can be actual arguments to
C_FUNLOC.

Edits against 06-007r1:
__________

[309:8+] Add a new paragraph:
"The program shall not invoke an internal procedure when its host
scoping unit is not active."

[310:1-] Add a new note:

"Note 12.20a
An internal procedure may not be invoked using a procedure pointer from
either Fortran or C after the host instance completes execution. While
the host instance is active, however, the internal procedure may
be invoked from outside of the host procedure scoping unit if that
internal procedure was passed as an actual argument or is the target
of a procedure pointer.

Assuming there exists a library procedure, written either in Fortran or
C and callable from either Fortran or C, that calculates the integral
of an arbitrary function f(x) over the interval [a,b]:

INTERFACE
   FUNCTION INTEGRATE(F,A,B) RESULT(INTEGRAL) BIND(C)
      USE ISO_C_BINDING
      INTERFACE
         FUNCTION F(X) BIND(C) ! Integrand
            USE ISO_C_BINDING
            REAL(KIND=C_FLOAT), VALUE :: X
            REAL(KIND=C_FLOAT) :: F
         END FUNCTION
      END INTERFACE
      REAL(KIND=C_FLOAT), VALUE :: A, B ! Bounds
      REAL(KIND=C_FLOAT) :: INTEGRAL
   END FUNCTION INTEGRATE
END INTERFACE

one can write f(x) as an internal procedure with access to any host
instance local variables necessary to actually calculate f(x):

FUNCTION MY_INTEGRATION(N,A,B) RESULT(INTEGRAL)
   ! Integrate f(x)=x^n over [a,b]
   USE ISO_C_BINDING
   INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: N
   REAL, INTENT(IN) :: A, B
   REAL :: INTEGRAL
   
   INTEGRAL=INTEGRATE(MY_F,REAL(A,C_FLOAT),REAL(B,C_FLOAT))
      ! This will call the internal function MY_F to calculate f(x)
      ! The above interface of INTEGRATE must be explicit and available

CONTAINS

   FUNCTION MY_F(X) BIND(C,NAME="") ! Integrand
      USE ISO_C_BINDING
      REAL(KIND=C_FLOAT), VALUE :: X
      REAL(KIND=C_FLOAT) :: MY_F
      MY_F=X**N ! N is taken from the host instance of MY_INTEGRATION
   END FUNCTION

END FUNCTION MY_INTEGRATION

The function INTEGRATE should not save a function pointer to MY_F
and use it after INTEGRATE has finished execution, because the host
instance of MY_F may no longer exist. If such a pointer is saved,
then it may only be used to invoke MY_F during the execution of the
host instance of MY_INTEGRATION."

{end note 12.20a}

[326:21] Replace constraint C1240 (R1227) with:
C1240 (R1227) If a <proc-language-binding-spec> is specified for an
internal procedure, the NAME= specifier shall appear and it shall
specify that the procedure has no binding label (15.4.1).

[481:10] Replace:
"the procedure is not a dummy procedure or procedure pointer" 
with
"the procedure is not a dummy procedure, an internal procedure, or
a procedure pointer"

[503:11+] Add a new item (21) to the list:
"(21) Any variable of type C_FUNPTR whose target is an internal
procedure becomes undefined when execution of the host instance of
the internal procedure is completed by execution of a RETURN or END
statement"
