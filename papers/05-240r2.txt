Subject: Execute an external program
Date: 2005 August 08

The execute a command line proposal was rated A by WG5
at the Delft meeting.  This paper attempts to provide edits
to implement it.

Previous papers assumed execute_command_line would be
a part of iso_fortran_env and also assumed that that section
would be reorganized to separate the constants and the procedures.
However, that reorganization has not occurred, so this paper places
execute_command_line in the general list of procedures.
It may be subject to a future reorganization if desired.

In Section 13.5.8, page 298, add to the list:

[298:5+] Add:
"EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE      execute an O/S command"

In Section 13.7, add to the list of procedures:

[315:24+] Add:
 "13.7.5+ EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE( COMMAND [, WAIT,
                                          EXITSTAT, CMDSTAT, CMDMSG ] )

*Description.* Execute the command line identified
               by the string COMMAND.  The processor must support
               synchronous and may support asynchronous execution
               of the external program.

*Class.* Subroutine.

*Arguments.*

COMMAND    shall be of type default character and
           shall be a scalar.  It is an INTENT(IN)
           argument.  It identifies the command line
           to be executed.  The interpretation is
           processor-dependent.

WAIT       shall be of type default logical and shall
(optional) be a scalar.  It is an INTENT(IN) argument.

EXITSTAT   shall be of type default integer and shall
(optional) be a scalar.  It is an INTENT(INOUT) argument.
           It shall not be present if WAIT is
           present with a value of false.

CMDSTAT    shall be of type default integer and shall
(optional) be a scalar.  It is an INTENT(OUT) argument.

CMDMSG     shall be of type default character and shall
(optional) be a scalar.  It is an INTENT(INOUT) argument.

When present and has the value true, EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE
returns after the indicated command line
has completed execution.  When present and has the value
false and the processor supports asynchronous execution
of the external command, EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE returns after
the indicated command line has started
execution.  In all other cases, the effect is
as if WAIT is present with a value of true.

If WAIT is present with a value of true, the value of
EXITSTAT is the processor-dependent exit
status of the command line execution, if available.
Otherwise, the value of EXITSTAT is unchanged.

CMDSTAT is assigned the value zero if
no error occurred during EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE
and assigned a processor-dependent
positive value otherwise.  If an error occurs
and CMDSTAT is not present, execution of 
the program terminates.  If the processor
does not support the concept of command lines execution,
CMDSTAT is assigned the value 1.

CMDMSG is assigned a processor-dependent error
message if the value of the variable
associated with the CMDSTAT argument
indicates an error occurred.  Otherwise,
the value of CMDMSG is unchanged."
