Subject: Finalization and assumed-size arguments with INTENT(OUT)

NUMBER: 
TITLE: Finalization and assumed-size arguments with INTENT(OUT)
KEYWORDS: finalization, INTENT(OUT), assumed size, dummy argument
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

MODULE m
  TYPE t
    INTEGER :: i
  CONTAINS
    FINAL :: finalizeT
  END TYPE
CONTAINS
  ELEMENTAL SUBROUTINE finalizeT(f)
    TYPE(t), INTENT(INOUT) :: f
    f%i = 10
  END SUBROUTINE
END MODULE

SUBROUTINE xyz (d)
  USE m
  TYPE(t), INTENT(OUT) :: d(*)
END SUBROUTINE

PROGRAM foo
  USE m
  EXTERNAL xyz
  TYPE(t) :: a(10) = t(5)
  CALL xyz(a(2))
END PROGRAM


4.5.5.2 of Fortran 2003 states:
    When a procedure is invoked, a nonpointer, nonallocatable object
    that is an actual argument associated with an INTENT(OUT) dummy
    argument is finalized.

For assumed-size arguments, this situation is similar to that of
default initialization with INTENT(OUT).  Default initialization is
prohibited for INTENT(OUT), assumed-size dummy arguments by C544.  A
similar restriction on finalization may have been overlooked.

Was this program intended to be standard-conforming?


ANSWER:

No, this program was not intended to be standard-conforming.  An edit
is supplied to correct this oversight.

[80:9]  Before "a type", insert "a finalizable type or".
