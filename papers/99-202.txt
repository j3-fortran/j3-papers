QUESTION:

14.1.2.4 (Resolving procedure references) seems to fail to resolve the
following example.

Consider:
  INTERFACE sin
    CHARACTER FUNCTION sinch(c)
      CHARACTER,INTENT(IN) :: c
    END
  END INTERFACE
  PRINT *,sin(3.5)  ! Reference to which procedure?
END

According to rule (1)(a), SIN is established to be generic; thus references
are resolved by the rules in 14.1.2.4.1.

In 14.1.2.4.1:
   Rule (1) fails - the reference is not consistent with any specific
interface
            in the interface block for SIN.
   Rule (2) fails for the same reason.
   Rule (3) fails because there is no INTRINSIC statement.
   Rule (4) fails because there is no host scoping unit.

Is this program legal?
How should the reference to the generic procedure be resolved?
