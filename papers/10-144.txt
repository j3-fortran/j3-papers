       John Reid welcomed everyone to the meeting.

       John reminded everyone that we will work right up until
       noon on Friday.

       The goals this week are to create the changes for the FDIS,
       prepare responses to the FCD ballot comments, review the draft
       TR on interoperability, look at defects for the last F2003
       interps, and draft an annex for WG23's vulnerabilities standard.

   2.2 Welcome from the Host

       Van Snyder is the host.

   2.3 Local arrangements

       The hotel will provide water, soda, and coffee.  Van will
       provide snacks.

   2.4 Appointments for this meeting

       David Muxworthy graciously accepted the role of secretary.

       John Reid will act as WG5 librarian.

       The drafting committee is comprised of:
         David Muxworthy, head    (BSI)
         Reinhold Bader           (Germany)
         Toon Moene               (Netherlands)
         Van Snyder               (USA)
         Makki Takata             (Japan)
         Jim Xia                  (Canada)

   2.5 Adoption of the Agenda [N1794]

       The agenda was approved.

   2.6 Approval of the Minutes of the Las Vegas 2009 Meeting [N1779]

       The minutes were approved.

3. Matters arising from the minutes

   There are no matters arising from the minutes that have not already
   been covered.

4. Status of Las Vegas 2009 Resolutions [N1778]

   D3.  Revision of Technical Corrigendum 4
        That WG5 directs its Convenor to negotiate with the SC22
        Secretariat to allow revision of the document to correct the
        known minor errors, described in WG5-N1783, rather than for it
        to undergo a complete new balloting process.

     >> Corrigendum 4 has been published.

   D4.  Technical Content of Fortran 2008 FCD
        That WG5 recommends to its primary development body that the
        technical content of the draft revised standard for Fortran
        which is to be submitted for FCD ballot shall be that in
        WG5-N1782 (also known as J3/09-007r2).  The primary development
        body is encouraged to make editorial corrections and
        clarifications and to resolve inconsistencies, but the technical
        content should not be changed unless a serious flaw is found.

     >> The FCD ballot has been completed.

** motion: 10-140 "F2008 edits for interp F03-0090" [Whitlock]
           section 3 (Whitlock/Cohen): uc

   Interp F03/0039 "HYPOT()" passed LB #7 with a change to remove the
   F2003 edit and say that the example is not the C "hypot" function.
   No F2008 change is necessary since the HYPOT example was removed
   from F2008.  This fix to F03/0039 will be reflected in the 006.

   Interp F03/0133 passed the WG5 LB #7 with no change.  It is a
   duplicate of F03/0046 {currently open} that will be closed.
   Related interp F03/0053 {currently open} will reference F03/0133.

   put into the interp for 006.  {post r1 to preserve the F2008 edits}

** /WG5 **

   Paper N1816-2 "Result of the interpretations ballot 7, N1806"
   [Reid] has the final status of all the interps in LB #7 {except
   0133 which should be Y}.

6. Consider the Final CD Ballot comments on Fortran 2008, decide on
   changes, and construct a response document.

   Paper N1813-1 "Responses to FCD comments" [Reid] needs ot note that
   10-126 plus F2008 section 5.3.4p2 resolve CA-01.

   Paper N1812-1 is "Strategic plans for WG5" [Reid].
   "There was a short discussion on the draft Strategic Plans document
   (N1812-1); various minor edits were suggested.  It was thought that
   discussion of revision of Fortran 2008 would be an appropriate topic
   for the June 2011 meeting.  The section relating to the TR on Further
   Interoperability with C would not be considered until later in the
   meeting." [N1810]

7. Review the draft TR on further interoperability of Fortran with C and
   decide on changes.

   There was a discussion Nick Maclaren's paper 'Objectivesr1' which had
   not yet been allocated a number [after revision it became 10-142 and
   then N1820].  This sought to define clearer objectives for the Further
   Interoperability with C project.  It was apparent also that the
   operational procedures for the project were unclear.  Therefore it was
   decided that the TR development body should be PL22.3 itself, and not
   as defined in London resolution L3, and that the mode of operation be
   similar to that for the base language standard, viz. that WG5 set the
   requirements and that PL22.3 implement them.

   The next task therefore was to develop this paper into a requirement
   document for consideration by WG5.  It was reported during the
   discussion that the second draft TR (N1808-1) was a great improvement
   on the first.

** motion: 10-141 "Ordering of NOT and NORM2" [Reid] (Cohen/Snyder): uc

** motion: 10-132r1 "Revised Interp F03-0135 in F2008" [Snyder] (Cohen/
           Snyder): uc

** /WG5 **

   UK ballot comment GB-1 "define a subset of Fortran 2008" was discussed.

     SV: create a new work project to define a compatible subset of
         Fortran 2008: Y-N-U: 3-9-3

     WG5 direction is to not create a subset of F2008.

   The next WG5 meeting will be in the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre
   (LRZ), Garching/Munich, Germany, on Monday through Friday, 27-Jun
   through 1-Jul-2011, joint with J3, hosted by LRZ and Reinhold Bader.

   The meeting after that will be in Markham/Toronto, Canada,
   11-15-Jun-2012, hosted by IBM and Jim Xia.

   Paper N1811-4 "draft resolutions of WG5 LV 2010 meeting" [Muxworthy]
   was discussed.

   Paper N1816-3 "WG5 LB #7 ballot results" [Reid] changes the status of
   F03/0133 to Y.  The paper is the final draft.

7. Review the draft TR on further interoperability of Fortran with C and
   decide on changes.

   Paper 10-142 "C Interoperability Objectives" [Maclaren] is N1820:

     SV: allow INTENT(OUT) allocatable arrays as dummies: Y-N-U: 11-1-3
     Constraint 5 was therefore to be removed from the document.

     SV: add mechanism to get array element address from subscripts:
         Y-N-U: 11-0-4

     Examples of new features to investigate:
       - rank remapping pointer assignment if contiguous
       - SELECT RANK construct to handle DIMENSION(..) dummies
       - DIMENSION(..) dummies passed to specific rank objects

       SV: should assumed rank dummies be used for other stuff?
           Y-N-U: 4-6-5
       Therefore the TR should not address these things but should leave
       open the possibility for future development.

       SV: should C interop TR specify the single descriptor model?
           Y-N-U: 11-0-4
       SV: should the TR allow assumed length character arguments? Y-N-U:
           6-4-5; WG5 country vote: Y-Germany & UK ,N-Canada, U-Japan,
           Netherlands,US
       SV: change C descriptor bounds from fixed sized array to flexible?
           Y-N-U: 10-0-5

     SV: investigate specifying names for descriptors for all types and
         ranks? Y-N-U: 11-0-4

   There will be a WG5 ballot in Jul-2010 of draft standard after the
   June J3 meeting.  "There was further discussion of the draft
   Strategic Plan, N1812-2, so far as it related to the Further
   Interoperability TR.  It was decided to extend the timescale so
   that the PDTR would be forwarded to SC22 for ballot in December
   2010 rather than April 2010." [N1810]

   Paper 10-142r1 "C Interoperability Objectives" [Maclaren], WG5 paper
   N1820, was accepted with changes {post r2}.

8. Consider the Fortran defect reports (interpretations) in J3-006.

   N1815 "Draft Technical Corrigendum 5" [Muxworthy] will be proof-read
   by a small group {Cohen, Muxworthy, Reid, Whitlock} "and then made
   available on the WG5 server.  It would not be subject to a WG5
   letter ballot as had sometimes happened with previous versions."
   [N1810]

9. Construct a draft Fortran annex for the TR on "Guidance to Avoiding
   Vulnerabilities in Programming Languages through Language Selection
   and Use".

   "In the absence of Dan Nagle, a member of WG23, no-one present was
   able to pursue this item." [N1810]

10. WG5 Business and Strategic Plans

10.1 Goals for 2010-2013 - see N1812 " Strategic plans for WG5" [Reid]

   "Van Snyder drew attention to four requirements from JPL which he had
   presented in the form of draft TRs (Coroutines and Iterators, A more
   complete type system, Physical or engineering units, General
   proposals) and which had been put on the J3 server.  It was possible
   that JPL would not support further Fortran development unless these
   were addressed.  He asked that these be considered at the next WG5
   meeting.  There was concern over WG5's workload and no decision was
   reached." [N1810]
