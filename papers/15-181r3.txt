Subject:   Additional co_reduce example
Date: 2015 August 05
Reference: TS 18508

1. Introduction
===============

Due in part to desirable space limitations, the MyAdd example
demonstrating co_reduce in 8.4.13 of TS 18508 (19 May 2015) appears
to be redundant with co_sum.  It would be helpful to demonstrate the
use of co_reduce in a way that extends the language rather than
recreating an existing capability.

2. Proposal
===========

Replace the Example in 8.4.13 for CO_REDUCE with an example that
demonstrates how to extend an existing language intrinsic to create
its natural collective counterpart.

3. Edits
========

[26:30-32] In 8.4.13 CO_REDUCE, replace the Example text "If the
number of images ... on both images" by

"The subroutine below demonstrates how to use CO_REDUCE to create
a collective counterpart to the intrinsic function ALL:

  SUBROUTINE co_all(boolean)
    LOGICAL, INTENT(INOUT) :: boolean
    CALL CO_REDUCE(boolean,both)
  CONTAINS
    PURE FUNCTION both(lhs,rhs) RESULT(lhs_and_rhs)
      LOGICAL, INTENT(IN) :: lhs,rhs
      LOGICAL :: lhs_and_rhs
      lhs_and_rhs = lhs .AND. rhs
    END FUNCTION both
  END SUBROUTINE co_all
"
