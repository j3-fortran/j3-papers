III. Changed unresolved issues

  paper 99-179

    modified issue 26 to say

    "Paper 99-179 added IEEE_SUPPORT_IO to the table in 15.8.1.
     Should it not also be mentioned somewhere in the text such
     as 15.3?  I think all the other IEEE procedures are mentioned
     somewhere in the early text of the section."

  paper 99-185r4

    modified issue 141 to say

      What about type parameters in other cases where deferred type
      parameters are not currently defined?  Paper 99-185r4 partly
      addressed this question, but it appears incomplete.  It mentions
      only the case where target is a disassociated pointer.  Three
      paras earlier, we felt it necessary to separately mention the
      cases where target is a pointer with undefined association
      status and where it was a reference to the NULL function.  Why
      did we have to distinguish those there and not here?  Perhaps
      the NULL function case is ok - I'm not quite sure why we
      distinguished that before (doesn't seem to me particularly
      different from some other function that returns a dissasociated
      pointer).  But a pointer with undefined association status is
      certainly different from a disasociated pointer.

      Also the former version of issue 141 mentioned the case where a
      null (should have said disassociated, I guess) pointer is an
      actual argument for a pointer dummy.  I see no edits or comments
      about that case.  Can I assume this means that it was looked at
      and determined not to be a problem?  Or was this issue closed
      without actually checking that all the questions it raised were
      addressed?

      Also, I find myself greatly confused by the revision that paper
      99-185r1 made to the above para.  In addressing the issue of
      undefined type parameter values, it appears to have changed the
      conditions on cases where the type parameters are well defined.
      And I don't understand the change.  The former version of this
      para said that *ALL* nondeferred type parameters of
      pointer-object had to agree with the corresponding type
      parameters of target.  The new version appears to allow
      disagreement as long as the type parameter of target is
      deferred.  This doesn't make sense to me.  (And this isn't a
      constraint, so its not just a matter of checkability).  There
      were words explicitly added to single out that case, so its
      presumably not just a matter of forgetting about the case.

  paper 99-186r1

    modified issue 79 to say

      Paper 99-186r1 addressed the issue of assumed and deferred dummy
      type parameters, but it doesn't look complete to me.  What about
      all the other cases of deferred type parameters (when the dummy
      is not allocatable or when the associated actual is not
      allocated)?  Suppose the dummy is a pointer?  Or suppose the
      actual is not allocated/associated?  Part of this issue overlaps
      issue 141, which was also only partly addressed.

  paper 99-205r2

    modified issue 156 as specified in the paper

  paper 99-219r1

    modified issue 14 to say

      In 12.4.1.6, how about cases like ASSOCIATED(X%P), where P is a
      pointer component of an optional argument X that is not present?
      I don't see that covered anywhere.  Its not a reference.  Its
      not supplying X as an actual argument (just a component of X).

  paper 99-179

    modified issue 158 as described in the paper.

  paper 99-222r2

    revised issue 64 to read

        The technical issues of the original issue 64 appear to be
        adequately addressed (with 2 alternatives, even), but the
        differences in the editorial treatment of ROUND= and DECIMAL=
        in 9.5.1 are confusing.  These two specifiers seem very
        similar in that they appear in both OPEN and in
        io-control-spec-list, with the one in OPEN applying only if
        there is none in the io-control-spec-list.  Why then are they
        described so differently in 9.5.1?  DECIMAL= has a subsection
        in 9.5.1, but ROUND= has none, just referring back to the OPEN
        statement.  Either mode seems ok, but I don't know why these
        two are inconsistent.

        Later...I see that paper 99-242 (which didn't pass) has words
        that could address this; perhaps that part of 99-242 can be
        used to fix this.

  paper 99-236

    revised issue 13 to read

        14.8.5(6) is now ok as far as it goes, but the default
        initialization stuff for INTENT(OUT) is not handled.  I have a
        note that Malcolm was going to write an interp on that.
        Pending such an interp, this is a placeholder to note that
        something is needed.

  paper 99-238r1

    revised issue 208 with the text from the paper (rather than
    deleting that issue and adding a new one on a similar matter.
    Also added the following para:

        Except that all the discussion about what's new in F2k doesn't
        belong mixed in the explanation of the organization at all, so
        it may get added here as a temporary measure, but it better
        end up getting moved.

  paper 99-241r2

    revised issue 3 to say

        Paper 99-241r2 made improvements, but there are still
        inconsistencies between sections 9.5.4 and 9.9.  Section 9.9
        says that execution of an input/output statement terminates
        when an error, end-of-file, or-end-of record condition occurs.
        It then describes several things that are supposed to happen
        after execution of the statement terminates.  This strikes me
        as somewhat of a contradition in terms.  These things are part
        of the execution of the statement; it says so in item 10 of
        both lists in 9.5.4.  This description also explicitly
        contradicts the part of 9.5.4 that shows determination of the
        error status as step 7, with several subsequent steps that are
        not skipped in the case of errors.

  paper 99-261r1

    modified issue 83 as described in the paper.

  paper 99-271r1

    modified issue 151 as described in the paper.

III. New unresolved issues

  paper 99-179, IEEE

    issue 212 - infinites and NaNs

      I inserted note 15.15 in section 15.8.2 as specified by paper
      99-179, but its placement puzzles me.  It comes after the
      description of IEEE_VALUE, which it doesn't appear to have much
      relevance to.  Perhaps it is intended to cover all of the
      procedures in 15.8.2, but this is not clear.  I also question
      whether 15.8 is a proper place for specifications like this at
      all.  The section says it is just a tabulation, and I find no
      other specifications in it.  I am also puzzled by this material
      being in a note.  Is this supposed to be a consequence of
      specifications elsewhere?

    issue 213 - IEEE_SET_ROUNDING_MODE

      I did the edit to IEEE_SET_ROUNDING_MODE as specified by 99-179.
      However, I note that this edit changed the technical meaning in
      a way that I am not sure was intended.  The restriction now says
      "for some X", whereas the previous version said "for any X".
      The meaning is very different.  I also suggest wording that uses
      a phrase like "with a ROUND_VALUE such that"; see, for example
      IEEE_SET_HALTING_MODE.

      Also, another edit in the same paper added a restriction on
      IEEE_SUPPORT_ROUNDING that makes it redundant to mention
      IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE here if we stay with "some", although it
      is still appropriate with "any".

  paper 99-203

    resurected issue 7.

  paper 99-205r2

    issue 218 - C variable interop definitions

      The paper's J3 note on this in 16.2.7 is numbered 218.
      I also added the following para:

      And while on the subject, will need to straighten out the useage
      of "shall" vs "may" in this regard.  The editor can't do this
      because he isn't clear about the intended meaning (and suspects
      that he isn't the only one).

    issue 219 - Association with C variables

      The paper's J3 note on this in 16.2.7.1 is numbered 219.

  paper 99-209

    issue 214 - value without bind(c)

      The note specified in paper 99-209 is assigned number 214.
      Also added the following para to it.

      "The editor notes, however, that INTENT(IN) dummies cannot
       currently be redefined and that allowing it in special cases
       would likely require changes in multiple places in the
       standard - and in his concept of what INTENT(IN) means. I
       certainly don't understand the above "thus"; it sounds to
       me more like the subsequent clause contradicts the preceding
       one instead of follows from it."

  paper 99-186r1

    issue 215 - polymorphic argument agreement

       Replaced an earlier version of this issue because paper
       99-254r2 seems to have fixed the problems I had with paper
       99-186r1.  But...

       The editor got a bit confused in entering the edits for the
       first few paras of 12.4.1.2.  Papers 99-186r1 and 99-254r2 both
       had edits in this area.  The later paper said that it replaced
       the earlier edits, but I got slightly confused about exactly
       how much was replaced.  For example, I construed the
       replacement to include deleting the note added by 99-186r1.

       If that note is resurected, I had several problems with it.  These
       included its use of the term "run-time" and its apparent
       assumption that restrictions that were not constraints would be
       checked at compile time.

       A sentence about the dummy argument assuming its type from the
       actual seems to have disappeared somewhere.  I'm not sure now
       whether some other paper said to delete it or whether I just
       did so by accident.  Too many papers for me to check now.

       Someone else needs to look over this.  It may be all fine, but
       it needs independent checking.

  paper 99-196r2, with

    issue 216 - associate-volatile interactions

      The paper's J3 note on this is numbered 216.

  paper 99-211r1, c_float

    issue 217 - c_float

      The editor thinks all the special negative values for C_FLOAT
      et. al. added by paper 99-211r1 are silly, overly complicated,
      and irrelevant.  C_FLOAT isn't asking about precision and range.
      It is asking about interoperability with C.  I don't see what
      precision and range even have to do with it.  But just because
      the editor thinks it silly doesn't make it wrong.  Feel free to
      delete this issue if, on reflection, you find the editor's
      objection sillier than what he is objecting to.

  paper 99-222r2, responses to wg5

    issue 220 - round to nearest

      The paper's J3 note on this is numbered 220.  Added also a
      second para:

        The editor questions tbe assumptions in the above para about
        "average consumer expectations", but he appears to be in a
        small minority, at least in J3.

      ...later.  This issue is resolved by a later paper (99-273) in
      this same batch, but it already got a number.  So the number
      stays assigned, but the issue never actually made it to a
      released version of the 007 document.

  paper 99-238, intro stuff

    issue 221 - host association intro

       The paper's J3 note on this is numbered 221.

  paper 99-247r3, pointer stuff

    issue 222 - pointer targets

      The preceding sentence (It may be specified..." does not parse
      the way that I suspect it was intended.  I suspect it was
      intended to be a list of 3 ways, but it doesn't parse that way.
      The last phrase (beginning with "or") doesn't make sense as an
      object of "specified" (or it would read "specified be the
      result...").  Thus I parse the sentence as giving two ways, with
      "by a pointer" as an appositive description of what it means to
      be specified directly.  I didn't bother to try to rewrite it,
      partly because I was also uncertain of the following extra
      question.

      I'm not sure what the phrase "target of a pointer assignment" is
      supposed to mean anyway.  We have the target of a pointer -
      that's one thing.  And we also have the <target> in a pointer
      assignment statement, which is another.  The description above
      sounds like a mixture of the two.  The <target> of a pointer
      assignment statement is a bnf term and should be italic.  But it
      also doesn't need to be a data object or procedure.  (It could
      be a null pointer, which I don't think is either - though I
      could be wrong on that).  The target of a pointer can be
      specified in many ways other than a pointer assignment
      statement.  I find the para more confusing than helpful, but
      perhaps it's just me.

  paper 99-254r2, unlimitted polymorphic

    issue 223 - polymorphic objects

      Seems to me that section 5.1.1.8 on polymorphic objects could
      use some cleanup and re-ordering.  The 1st sentence of the 2nd
      para appears to ignore the unlimitted polymorphic case.  The 3rd
      para starts talking about being associated with objects "out of
      the blue."  Its the first time the word "associated" appears in
      the section, but it sounds like it is meaning to refer to
      material above.  The definition of "dynamic type" seems a bit
      late, being several paras after we started discussing the
      concept.  And it looks like we repeat ourselves in talking about
      the concepts of what types an object may assume, what types a
      type is type-compatable with, and what types an object may be
      associated with.

    issue 224 - type compatibility in pointer assignment.

      Doesn't the above constraint (requiring type compatibility) make
      the one before it (special case for non-polymorphic) redundant?

  paper 99-260, C glossary entries

    issue 225 - italics in glossary

      Paper 99-260 is only the latest of many papers to ignore the
      above-described convention about use of italics in the glossary.
      The editor is too rushed to attempt to fix it this time, and it
      wouldn't be surprising if he had forgotten it or missed some
      cases other times.  If we retain this convention, the whole
      glossary should be reviewed to do it consistently.  I would
      propose that we instead drop the convention.  I find it more
      obtrusive and garish than helpful (seems like half of the words
      are italic).  Evidence suggests that there are others on J3 who
      also don't find it useful - I don't know any other explanation
      for the regularity with which it is neglected.  (Those who might
      suggest that it is intentionally left to the editor to handle
      are advised not to make such suggestions in the editor's
      presense).

  paper 99-262r1, BIND(C)

    issue 226 - BIND(C)

       The paper's J3 note on this is numbered 226
       Also added the xtra sentence.

       If it is fixed, might as well fix its 2nd "shall" also; it
       would be better as something more like "has to", "needs to", or
       "is required to".

  paper 99-270r1, interop

    issue 227 - enum interop

       The above sentence (in 4.7) still talks about objects
       interoperating with types and wasn't fixed by 99-270r1.  The
       sentence is also pretty convoluted to the extent that I'm not
       sure it makes sense.  What does it mean to talk about a type
       that the processor uses to represent a type?

    issue 228 - bind or bind(c) attribute?

       I'm confused about when we refer to the BIND attribute versus
       the BIND(C) attribute.  I can't detect a pattern.  Section
       5.1.2.15 defines the BIND attribute, but we seem to refer to it
       more often as BIND(C) than just bind (see an example in
       5.1.2.14; there are others elsewhere).

    issue 229 - xref for binding label

      Paper 99-270r1 deleted the section that was cross-referenced
      above.  I'm not sure whether to substitute some other section or
      to just delete the xref.  The scope of binding labels is now
      discussed in 14.1.1, which might be a possibility, but I'll let
      interop make the decision.

  paper 99-271r1, bind-specs

    issue 230 - constraint on procedure-declaration-stmt

      Two problems with the last constraint in 12.3.2.3.  First, there
      is no such bnf term as language-bind-spec.  I suspect
      language-binding-spec was meant, but bind-spec also seems
      possible (given my general confusion here).  Note it appears
      twice.

      Second, it fails to deal with the optionality of proc-interface.
      It is not explicit whether proc-interface is required to appear
      and to meet these conditions, or whether these are conditions
      that must be met if proc-interface appears.  I am guessing the
      former, but it isn't explict and could be read either way.

    issue 231 - example of BIND=

      The role of the first USE ISO_C_BINDING in the above example (in
      12.5.2.1) is unclear.  It doesn't have much to do with the
      interface body.  At first, I thought it just an accident that
      should have been deleted when the USE inside of the interface
      body was added.  On further thought, it might be for the actual
      arguments in the subsequent invocation of JOE.  If that is the
      intent, it would be clearer if the invocation of JOE were added
      to the same code block (possibly after an ellipsis).  The
      descriptive words could then be modified to reflect the change.
      As is, the introductory sentence for the first code block just
      says that it is an interface body, but then the first thing in
      the code block has nothing to do with the interface body.

    issue 232 - meaning of BINDNAME=

      Note 12.33 in 12.5.2.1 appears to assume a specific meaning for
      BINDNAME=, without ever stating that assumption.  Otherwise the
      leap from talking about the number of BINDNAME= bind-specs to
      the number of external bind names is a complete non sequitur.

      Consider this the editor's attempt to appeal what he considers
      an unsatisfactory resolution of issue 156.  I can accept that
      the feature is desired.  I can also accept that the feature has
      aspects that are very processor-dependent.

      But I strongly argue that the normative text needs to say
      *SOMETHING* about what the feature is.  Otherwise, it does not
      achieve its stated objective of standardizing anything except
      that there is a feature called BINDNAME= with strange
      restrictions on where it may be used.

      As is, this is not at all like kind parameters.  The specific
      values of kind parameters are processor dependent, but the
      standard at least defines the concept - that kind parameters
      designate representations.  For BINDNAME=, the normative text
      says *NOTHING*, and the note about how it might be used just
      emphasizes that there are no requirements.  Its effects don't
      even have to be limited to the procedure that it is attached to;
      for all the standard says, that's just a handy place to put some
      syntax that is completely unrelated to the procedure.

      We ought to at least be able to say that BINDNAME= has something
      to do with the name(s) or means by which a procedure could be
      invoked, even if the details are processor-dependent.  If we
      aren't going to say even that much, then every place that
      assumes it (like note 12.33) had better state the assumption.

  paper 99-263r1, import

    issue 233 - host association of defined operators

      Should the IMPORT statement allow defined operators as well as
      names?  The USE statement does.  Now that I think of it, are
      defined operators ever host-associated?  From a quick skim of
      14.6.1.3, it doesn't appear to me that they are.  If that is
      correct, I find this difference between USE and host association
      puzzling.  If that is incorrect, we better fix the inconsistency
      in description.  Looks like the defined operators in USE are new
      to f2k, so at least its not an f95 interp question (I wasn't
      sure until I looked).

    issue 234 - async and import

      Can the asyncronous attribute be respecified for an entity
      imported into an interface body?  The above words in 12.3.2.1
      say not.  The first note in 14.6.1.3 says it may, with no
      exception for the interface body case.

      Also, shouldn't that same note mention VOLATILE?  I don't see
      the volatile statement listed in the numbered list in 14.6.1.3,
      so I assume it works like ASYNCHROUNOUS in thie regard.

    issue 235 - host association and interface bodies

      The above 2nd note in 14.6.1.3 no longer appears to be correct.

    issue 236 - intro to type-param-value

      Section 4.2 needs work on its transition of subject.  The first
      part of the section talks about what type parameters are and how
      they are used.  We then jump into the bnf for type-param-value.
      Whereas I agree that bnf can fit here, it needs a better
      introduction/transition.  Something to introduce that we are now
      talking about how to specify the values.  The two sentences
      deleted from this section by 99-267 were the only ones that even
      mentioned the specification of type parameter values.  They may
      have been redundant/vacuous, but this needs something, probably
      as a lead-in paragraph before the bnf.  Not much - just a
      sentence or two, but I don't have a good sentence at hand.

      And the sentence above this note - about agreement of the kind
      of the type parameters - just doesn't fit here at all.  I think
      it was better in 4.5.5.  This does only apply to derived types;
      thats the only place where we even define an integer kind of a
      type parameter.  We haven't yet defined enough of the concepts
      for this to make any sense here.  What is the integer kind of a
      type parameter?  What defines a correspondence between a type
      parameter value and a type parameter?

  paper 99-273, I/O rounding modes

    issue 237 - compatable rounding mode

      A collection of issues about compatable rounding mode.  First,
      it seems anomalous that the exact behavior of COMPATABLE is
      specified, whereas that of NEAREST is not.  The processor can
      make NEAREST like IEEE or it can do about anything else with it.
      The requirement that NEAREST do IEEE round-to-nearest if it is
      supported is circular; if thats not how the processor does
      NEAREST, it just says that it isn't supported.  But we specify
      exactly what a processor must do for COMPATABLE.  There are no
      conditions.  If we are willing to specify that much detail for
      compatable, why not specify it for NEAREST also?  Note that this
      is I/O rounding only, so its not a matter of hardware; its a
      matter of the I/O library.

      I am concerned about a specification that depends on exact
      equality (of the mid-point).  We tell users not to do that.
      Perhaps that is why we waffled on the IEEE case.  If so, have we
      done anything to address that, or did we decide to ignore it in
      one case, but worry about it in the other.  For example, what if
      a value to be output is stored in a temporary register with
      extra precision.  And for input, how is the processor going to
      determine that a decimal value is exactly halfway between two
      representable binary values?  We have left no leeway for
      approximations here.  And as soon as we allow approximations,
      then the distinction between COMPATABLE and NEAREST becomes
      confusing.

      Most of the discussion about this option has been for the case
      of output.  I'm dubious that input has been carefully
      considered.  However the wording of the draft uses terminology
      that appears to assume input (it talks about being between two
      representable values - that's a terminology we use for internal
      values, not for decimal ones).  But this is all in a section
      that applies equally to input and output.  This needs at least
      clarification, and possibly fixing.

      Finally, and least importantly, the sentence defining the
      behavior is a little weak grammatically.  But I don't see it as
      worth fixing until the other issues are addressed.  SO I didn't
      bother.
