Subject: Nagging Doubts                               24 Jul 2003

A large number of decisions were made in a short time at the most
recent joint J3-WG5 meeting.  Under such circumstances, it can be
easy to make mistakes.  After reviewing the actions of that
meeting, I find that I am satisfied for the most part with the
decisions made, either because I agree with a decision, because I
feel the difference between the decision and my preferred outcome
is not that significant, or because I see believe the language
can reasonably be "fixed" to address my concerns in a future
revision.  There are, however, a handful of decisions about which
I have serious concerns, in part because I believe it would be
extremely difficult to "fix" them later.

This paper presents my concerns about these issues along with the
specification of what I believe to be a way those concerns could
resolved within our current timetable.  Edits corresponding to
those specifications are being prepared as papers for J3 meeting
165.  I hope WG5 will be able to briefly consider each issue and
decide whether

*  it is a serious problem and J3 should be charged with fixing
    it (possibly with my proposed solution and edits),

*  it is not a problem and J3 should do nothing to address it, or

*  it is enough a problem that J3 should be authorized to address
    it if a satisfactory solution can be crafted at meeting 165
    (again, possibly using my solution and edits).

=======================================
Nagging Doubt I:  Allocating Assignment
=======================================

By "allocating assignment", I mean the feature that adopted in
response to UK response item TC10.  I think the basic idea of
evaluating an expression and then reallocating an allocatable
variable to hold it is a desirable one.  My concerns relate to
the decision to package this functionality as part of the
intrinsic assignment.  (I also have general reservations about
the wisdom of doing something this big this late in the
process.)

One of the areas of concern is code performance.  The primary
problem here is that decision whether an assignment to an
allocatable variable is a new allocating assignment or an ordinary
nonallocating assignment is based on attributes that unlikely to
be determinable at compile time.  As a result, the code for most
such assignment statements will have to include the code for both
alternatives with a run-time test to determine which to execute.
The cost of the test itself can be dismissed as likely to be small
compared to the cost of the assignment.  One must also take into
account the cost of having code for two cases when one will likely
execute only one or the other; most of the time, this effect will
also be negligible, but in situations where the memory and cache
are already stressed, this effect could be dramatic.  A more
serious effect is that the variant execution paths will tend to
interfere with the identification of opportunities for optimizations
such a loop jamming; it is unclear how often such opportunities
occur, but any time such an opportunity is lost, the performance
effect is likely to be significant.  Yet another possible source
of significant loss is that in some cases this hybrid requires and
in other cases it encourages code that does an extra whole array
copy when compared to a purer implementation of the underlying
concept of allocating assignment.

It can be argued that by changing

       variable = expr

to either

       variable(:) = expr

or

       if(allocated(variable)) deallocate(variable)
       variable = expr

one can provide enough information for a compiler to know at
compile time which case applies and thus avoid the performance
problems associated with not knowing.  If we skip for the moment
the argument about whether these techniques would actually work,
one is still left with the question of whether we can consider
reasonable a design which requires one to engage in such
techniques to obtain best performance.

The other major area of concern is semantic consistency.  Part of
the problem is that in a number of cases, assignment to an
existing allocation does _not_ produce an equivalent result to
deallocating that allocation, allocating a new allocation with
the same size and type parameters, and assigning to that.  Among
the differences are that the bounds of allocation may be different,
that the old value is not finalized, and that allocation that
is the recipient of the assignment has that old value instead of
a default new value.  (At first I thought the last point didn't
matter because the assignment was intrinsic assignment, but then
I realized that intrinsic assignment may involve type-bound
assignment of its components and type-bound assignment could
have an INTENT(INOUT) argument for the variable being assigned
to, so the old value of the variable _can_ make a difference,
even for intrinsic assignment.)  In other words, the effect of
assigning a value to an allocatable variable already having
matching shape and type parameters could produce dramatically
different results from both the results when assigning to a
variable that does not having a matching allocation and from
the results when performing the same assignment between
allocatable components as a part of intrinsic assignment.  This
last point is especially ironic, given that the original
justification for introducing this feature was to make intrinsic
assignment to allocatable variables more consistent with the
handling of allocatable components.  Of course, one can force
consistency with the

       if(allocated(variable)) deallocate(variable)
       variable = expr

trick, but should this be necessary?

[Aside: there are some odd differences in the description of
how the bounds of an allocatable component are determined in
intrinsic assignment and how the bounds are determined for an
allocatable variable.  In particular, these may be inconsistent
for zero size array extents.  It may be that there is no way
for a running program to detect this difference (because of the
way LBOUND and UBOUND operate on zero size extents), but if we
do not make this question moot by adopting my suggested
solution below, we should at least do something about this
inconsistency.]

Another part of the semantic consistency concern derives from the
fact that this feature is tied to intrinsic assignment.  For
allocatable components, it is intrinsic assignment of the type
that contains the allocatable components, and the value of the
allocatable component may actually be transferred by type-bound
assignment.  For allocatable variables, it is intrinsic assignment
of the variable itself, so necessarily no defined assignment
(type-bound or otherwise) can take place.  Not only do we not
automatically provide an allocating variant of type-bound
assignment, it is effectively impossible to provide one manually.
(One can provide one only if one doesn't the nonallocating form.)
This kind of distinction between intrinsic assignment and defined
assignment seems much at odds with the strategy we have been
following in developing defined types.

The more I look at this packaging of allocating assignment, the
more problems I find.  I hope that by now it is obvious that at
best it has more problems than we can reasonably expect to fix
and stay on schedule for the production of this revision and at
worst it may have more problems than we could ever fix.

===================
Possible Solution I
===================

A. Remove this feature.  (This section of the edits will, in
    essence, be an explicit reversal of the edits from J3/03-118r3.)

B. It may be that the wisest course of action would be to defer
    any further action in this area to the next revision, but there
    was so much desire for this functionality at the last meeting
    that I suspect many members will be reluctant to remove the
    flawed allocating assignment without providing a replacement.
    An appropriate replacement would be to package a purer version
    of the functionality in a distinct syntax.

    This syntax could easily be a new intrinsic procedure, but the
    edits I am preparing for J3 meeting 165 will use the syntax

          <variable> := <expr>

    (Although I can argue some minor mnemonic significance to ":=",
    this notation could easily be changed to some other combination
    of characters not already in use.)  The variable is reallocated
    whether or not its current allocation has shape and type
    parameters matching those of the expression.  The assignment is
    then performed as for

          <variable> = <expr>

    [The use of a distinct syntax eliminates the performance problems
    and the semantic consistency problem resulting from having to
    remain compatible with existing nonallocating assignment results.
    The fact that its semantics are defined in terms of ordinary
    assignment avoids the inconsistencies between the handling of
    intrinsic assignment and defined assignment.]

C. Although it would not be strictly necessary, it seems a good
    idea to rewrite the description of the handling of allocatable
    components in terms of the ";=" allocating assignment statement.

    [This should make it conceptually easier to understand ("=>"
    for pointers, ":=" for allocatables, and "=" for everything
    else) and avoids the possibility of inadvertent inconsistency
    between the handling of allocatable variables and allocatable
    components.]

====================================
Nagging Doubt II: Type Compatibility
====================================

For the most part, the concept of type compatibility could be
summarized as "A is type compatible with B if the type declaration
of A is always a correct (if less specific) description of B."
When used in argument association, this kind of type compatibility
means that dummy argument A is associated with all of B.  When
used for pointer assignment, it means that pointer A can point to
all of B

There is one exception: an object of TYPE(T) is considered type
compatible with an object of CLASS(T).  When used in argument
association, this kind of type compatibility means that there is
a part of B that dummy argument A can be associated with.  Note,
however, that although there are many situations where A might
be a correct description of part of B, this is the _only_ one that
is considered type compatible.

If one looks only at the text, one might conclude that this looks
like an editorial accident.  If one looks at how this facility
developed, one might conclude that it is the lest vestige of the
concept originally adopted and then modified because of its
impact on the generic rules.  However it came to be, combining
two concepts the different in one term is a disaster waiting to
happen, both for the developers and maintainers of the standard
and for users whose programs won't work the way they expect them
to.

Since the first concept is consistently developed and the second is
not, I suggest removing the latter.

If the second form of type compatibility were not already a part of
the standard, I know of no convincing reason it should be added (now
or in a future revision).  The only reason I have heard for not
removing it now is concern for making changes late in the process.

If we remove the second form now and we discover later that it
really would have been beneficial, it would be possible to add it
in a future revision and remain compatible with this revision.
If we leave it in and find that is really as much of a disaster
as I fear there will be no way to remove it and remain compatible.

Under the circumstances, it seems to me that the responsible thing
to do would be to eliminate this odd exception.

====================
Possible Solution II
====================

A. The edit to remove the exception is trivial and requires no
    further specification.

B. In certain circumstances, it can be awkward to deal with the
    TYPE(T) part of a CLASS(T) object.  If one needs only to
    access the components of the TYPE(T) subobject, there is no
    problem.  If one can that the object is some specific
    extension type, one can then access its parent component.  The
    awkwardness exists when neither of these conditions is true.
    The exception provided a way to finesse the awkwardness by
    implicitly converting a CLASS(T) object into a TYPE(T) object,
    but with the elimination of the exception, it would be
    helpful to address this awkwardness directly.

    A simple way to do this is to treat a CLASS(T) object as
    effectively being of an extension type and allow one to
    reference its parent component T.  This is a clean solution
    conceptually and in its implementation.  The only difficulty
    is finding a way to express it in the current editorial
    framework.  It is hoped that the edits being prepared for
    J3 meeting 165 will suffice.

=======================================================
Nagging Doubt III: The "Value" of a Derived-Type Object
=======================================================

J3/03-111r2 introduced text that was intended to clarify the
meaning of the "value" of a derived-type object.  I suggest that
this text is directly inadequate for types with pointer components
and effectively inadequate when nonpointers are used in
pointer-like ways.

Consider a statement such as

       CALL SUB(X,(X))

The expression (X) has a value identical to the value of X at the
time SUB is called, and the processor is supposed to make that
value accessible through the second dummy argument of SUB
for the entire execution of SUB.  According to the text in 4.5.7,
this value includes the pointer association of any pointer
components of X.  How is a processor supposed to preserve this
part of the value for the duration of SUB's execution?  At first
glance it may seem sufficient to use pointer assignment to
copy this association to another pointer (or pointer component).
This new point will certainly have the same pointer association
immediately after the copy.  However, if during the execution of
SUB, it uses the first dummy argument to access that pointer
component of X and deallocate its target, then our copy is no
longer the same pointer association.  Although it may be the same
bits, it has transformed from a defined pointer association to an
undefined pointer association.  It appears to me that under this
definition of value, there is no way for the processor to
preserve the value of (X).

Instead of a pointer component, imagine that X has an integer
component, but that this component is interpreted as a subcript
into an array that has the real pointer component.  According to
4.5.7, as long as the processor preserves the value of that
subscript, it has preserved the value of X.  I would suggest that
if SUB uses that subscript to find the pointer component of the
array element and deallocate its target, things are equally
broken -- the definition of value just doesn't recognize that
it is broken.  (This is what I meant when I said that the text
is effectively inadequate for nonpointers used in pointer-like
ways.)

I suggest that for derived-types, we can give rules for
enumerating the possible representations that type could have,
but that enumeration is not the same thing as an enumeration of
the values of that type.  On the one hand, two different
representations might represent the same value (e.g., in a
RATIONAL type, 1/2 and 2/4 are the same value even though they
are different representations).  On the hand, at different times
in a program, the same representation might represent different
values (as in our example of using subscripts to access value
information stored elsewhere).  It is reasonable that the default
interpretation be that values are the same if and only if they
have the same representation, but it must be possible for users
to construct abstractions that override that default
interpretation.

=====================
Possible Solution III
=====================

I suggest that values of a derived type exist only in the context
of objects of that type.  So long as the value of an object has a
particular value, the representation in that object is a
representation of that value, but if it is necessary to preserve
that value past the point when the original object would cease to
have that value, the only way to do so is to assign that value to
another object of the same type, type parameters, and shape.

To keep this solution compatible with what Fortran 90/95 processors
are currently doing, this should be limited to type-bound and
intrinsic assignment.  In a program, such a Fortran 90/95 program,
that has no type-bound assignment, those intrinsic assignments
will effectively be bit copies, and you will get the same results
as front existing processors, but when type-bound assignment is
added to the mix, Fortran 2K will have to execute more user code.

What the draft is currently calling the value of a derived type
should instead be called the representation of a value, and the
draft can then specify under what circumstances this
representation will continue represent the same value and when it
can obtain a different representation by assigning that value to
a new object.

=======================================
Nagging Doubt IV: Function Side-Effects
=======================================

Although Fortran functions are allowed to have side effects, a
Fortran processor is allowed under at least some circumstances
not to deliver those side effects.  There is disagreement how
great this license is, but even under the most restrictive
interpretations, there is no way for the writer of a function
to ensure that its side effects will be delivered.

In contrast, C does reliably deliver function side effects, so
C APIs often involve functions whose purpose is to deliver
side effects.  However, there is nothing in C interoperability
that changes a processor's license not to deliver those side
effect.

Although I believe implementors will make a good faith effort not
to optimize away function references whose side effects are
significant, I think inevitable that on some processors under
some levels of optimization, there will be some C interoperability
programs that will not work as intended because functions will
significant side effects will be optimized away.  I fear that these
failures will be blamed on the features and the standard, rather
than on the programs and the processors.  I suggest that if C
interoperability is to be fully successful, we must do something
to ensure that significant function side effects are consistently
delivered.

====================
Possible Solution IV
====================

One possibility would be to require a processor to always deliver
function side effects.  I suggest that such a requirement would
never be acceptable in practice, as many nonstandard programs
depend on "short circuit" evaluation of logical expressions.

Another possibility would be to require a processor to always
deliver the side effects of C functions.  This would solve the
immediate problem, but I think it would create new problems of
its own.  I think we would see many programs in which BIND(C)
would be specified solely for the purpose of protecting side
effects and that the requirements that arguments of such functions
be interoperable with C would lead to significant complaints.

The solution I recommend is therefore to provide an explicit way
for a program to identify functions whose side effects need to
be delivered.  The method I suggest is a keyword analogous to
PURE.  The particular keyword I suggest is VOLATILE, because there
are a number of similarities to volatile variables, including the
fact that a function that references a volatile variable will
likely be one that needs to be executed each time it is
referenced.  However, there is no editorial dependence on this
similarity, so this keyword is changed.  The principal semantic
effect of identifying a function as volatile is to remove it from
the rule that allows some function references not to be executed.
Additionally, nonvolatile functions can be associated with volatile
dummy procedures and procedure pointers much as pure procedures can
be associated with nonpure dummy procedures and procedure pointers.

Strictly speaking, these changes are ones that could be made in a
future revision, but I believe the political necessity of C
interoperability working reliably in this revision also makes
it necessary to make these changes now.
