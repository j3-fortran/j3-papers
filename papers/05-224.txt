TITLE: Finalization of array constructors
KEYWORDS: Finalization, array constructor
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

      MODULE m
        TYPE t
          INTEGER i
        CONTAINS
          FINAL :: finalizeT
        END TYPE
      CONTAINS
        SUBROUTINE finalizeT(obj)
          TYPE(t) :: obj(:)
          PRINT *, 'Finalizing a rank-1 array of type t'
        END SUBROUTINE
      END MODULE

      PROGRAM foo
        USE m
        TYPE(t) :: a
        a%i = 5
        PRINT *, (/ (a, i=1,5) /)
      END PROGRAM

If the PRINT statement in the main program was printing a function
result or a structure constructor, rather than an array constructor,
it is clear that the object should be finalized after that PRINT
statement.

However, for array constructors, this does not appear to be the case.
In the main program above, should the entity created by the array
constructor be finalized after execution of the PRINT statement?

ANSWER:

Yes, the array constructor should be finalized.  Edits are provided to
correct this oversight.
