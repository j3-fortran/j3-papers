Subject: Procedure pointers in BLOCK DATA program units

NUMBER: F03/0063
TITLE: Procedure pointers in BLOCK DATA program units
KEYWORDS: Procedure pointer, common block, block data
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

It is clear that procedure pointers are permitted in common blocks.
However, due to the restrictions on BLOCK DATA program units, it seems
that such a common block can not appear in a BLOCK DATA program unit.

Was it intended that common blocks containing procedure pointers could
be initialized in a BLOCK DATA program unit?

ANSWER:

Yes, it was intended that common blocks containing procedure pointers
could be initialized in a BLOCK DATA program unit.  Edits are provided
to correct this oversight.

EDITS:
All edits refer to 04-007.

[253:12]  After "derived-type definitions", insert
          ", abstract interface blocks,".

[253:14]  Before "and type declaration", insert
          "procedure declaration statements,".

[254:3]   After "specifiers", insert
          "if it declares a data object".

[254:1]   Append a new sentence:
              A procedure declaration statement shall not declare an
              external procedure.
