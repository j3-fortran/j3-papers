Subject: Bit interp: Maximum value for SHIFT argument.

NUMBER: F08/0035
TITLE: Maximum value for SHIFT argument to SHIFTL and SHIFTR.
KEYWORDS: SHIFTL, SHIFTR, BIT_SIZE
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

A significant part of the justification for the addition of the
redundant SHIFTL and SHIFTR intrinsic functions was that in the case
of a nonconstant SHIFT argument, the generated code needed to test the
shift direction and that such tests were inefficient.

However, it is not uncommon for the actual hardware shift instructions
to only shift the argument modulo the bit size, for either 32-bit or
64-bit shifts, or both.  Since SHIFT is allowed to be equal to the bit
size, this means that tests still need to be done to check for this
case.

Since being able to generate the value zero by shifting an arbitrary
nonzero argument completely, applying the feature justification leads
one to surmise that perhaps SHIFT should have been limited to
BIT_SIZE-1 instead of BIT_SIZE.

Q. Should the maximum value of the SHIFT argument to the SHIFTL and
   SHIFTR intrinsics be BIT_SIZE or BIT_SIZE - 1?

Note: A similar argument does not apply quite so straightforwardly to
      SHIFTA, since it provides new functionality.

ANSWER:

A. Although allowing SHIFTL and SHIFTR by BIT_SIZE provides little
   useful functionality, this is allowed for consistency with ISHFT.

ALTERNATIVE ANSWER:

A. Yes, the SHIFT argument should have been limited to BIT_SIZE - 1;
   an edit is supplied to correct this.
