This is a response to 06-343.

Q. [34:26-27] C313 needs to be rewritten so that it does not have three
   negatives.

A. Agreed.

EDIT. [34:26-27] Replace C313 with
  "If the first token is MACRO the second token shall be not be a
   keyword or name."


Q. Can the first <result-token> be DEFINE or EXPAND?
A. Yes.
Q. If yes, then why are these separate items in the BNF for R322?
   The way things are it is ambiguous whether a statement
      DEFINE MACRO ...
   is a <macro-body-stmt> or a <macro-definition>.
A. This should be fixed.

EDIT. [34:37+] Add new constraint
  "C3xx (R333) If the first token is DEFINE the second token shall not be MACRO."

Q. As a specific example, can a macro define a macro with a variable number
   of arguments, where the number of arguments is an argument of the
   top-level macro?
A. I do not understand this ambiguous question.


Q. There is a clear provision for macros defining macros. Here is
   an attempt at an example of using such a macro---to be included in
   a Note or Annex C:
A. Agreed.

EDIT. Append example to clause 3.

! Macro that defines a macro which assigns a value to an array element
DEFINE MACRO :: assign_shortcut(rank)
   DEFINE MACRO assign_%%rank(array,indices,value)
      MACRO INTEGER :: i
      array(indices(1)&&
      MACRO DO i=2,rank
           ,indices(i)&&
      MACRO END DO
            )=value
   END MACRO assign_%%rank
END MACRO assign_shortcut

! Create assignment macros for all ranks
MACRO DO i=1,15
   EXPAND assign_shortcut(i)
MACRO END DO

! Now use the rank-3 assignment macro:
REAL :: A(10,10,10)
INTEGER :: indices(3)=[1,5,6]
EXPAND assign_3(A,indices,5.0)
! Expands to:
! A(indices(1),indices(2),indices(3))=5.0


Q. [36:30] I find "statement-dependent" in item (3) too vague---maybe say
   "Macro statement processing". The expansion of macros is in a sense
   iterative, expanding MACRO and EXPAND statements until there are
   none left to expand. This was not really clear to me from reading
   the description.
A. The statement-dependent processing is specified immediately after the
   specification of token replacement and token concatenation (items 1 and 2).

Q. [38:5-6] I believe that we should be specific that token replacement
   and concatenation are the ONLY forms of expansion that occur.
A. We are specific in that we only define what happens.
