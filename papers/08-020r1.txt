         ultimate component of type LOCK_TYPE defined in the intrinsic
         module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV, its parent type shall have an ultimate
         component of type LOCK_TYPE."
{08-256r2, m185}

[74:4.5.6.3p8] Insert  ", noncoindexed " before "object".
{08-199r1, m185}

[74:4.5.6.3p9] After "is executed" (but before the comma),
  Insert "and the variable is not a coindexed object".
{08-199r1, m185}

[74:4.5.6.4p1+] After the paragraph but before Note 4.50,
  Insert new paragraph
    "Coindexed objects are not finalized."
{08-199r1, m185}

[99:5.3.18p1 C556]
  Replace entire constraint "An entity ... dummy data object." with
    "C556 An entity with the VALUE attribute shall be a dummy data object
          that is not an assumed-size array."
{08-147r1, m184}

[99:5.3.18p1 C558]
  Delete constraint "If an entity ... initialization expression."
{08-147r1, m184}

[115:6.2] After the heading "6.2 Variable",
  Begin new subclause with "6.2.1 General".
{08-256r2, m185}

[116:6.3-] Immediately before "6.3 Constants" insert new subclause
  "6.2.2 Lock variables

   A <<lock variable>> is a scalar variable of type LOCK_TYPE
   (\ref{LOCK_TYPE}) defined in the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.  A
   lock variable can have one of two values: locked or unlocked.  The
   value of a lock variable can be changed with the LOCK and UNLOCK
   statements (8.5.4a). 

   Cxxx: A data entity that is or has an ultimate component of type
         LOCK_TYPE defined in the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV shall be
         a coarray.

   A lock variable shall not appear as:

   (1) the variable of an <assignment-stmt>,

   (2) an actual argument in a reference to a procedure if the associated
       dummy argument has the INTENT(OUT) attribute,

   (3) the <allocate-object> in an ALLOCATE statement in which SOURCE=
       appears, or

   (4) the selector in a SELECT TYPE or ASSOCIATE construct if the
       associate name of that construct appears in one of the above
       contexts.

   NOTE 6.1a
   Copying or changing the value of a lock other than via the LOCK and
   UNLOCK statements might not be safe if the copy or definition is not
   performed atomically and another image acquires or releases the lock
   without proper synchronization.  Additionally, not allowing the copying
   of locks gives freedom to implement the opaque type LOCK_TYPE without
   affecting the semantics of programs.  The requirement that lock
   variables be coarrays or subobjects of coarrays ensures that no
   copying occurs due to argument association and that they are
   efficiently accessible from remote images.
   [End NOTE]"
{08-256r2, m185}

[117:6.4.2 C616+]  Insert new constraint
  "C616a (R611) If <image-selector> appears, <data-ref> shall not be
         polymorphic or be a type that has an allocatable ultimate
         component that is either polymorphic or of a derived type with
         length type parameters."
{08-256r2, m185}

[157:7.2.2.2 C728+] Add new constraint
  "C728a (R741) The <scalar-variable> shall not be a coindexed object."
{08-143r3, m184}
{The editor comments that this would be better done by modifying C728.}

[179:8.1.7.7 C826] After this constraint add a new one:
  "C826a An image control statement shall not appear within a DO CONCURRENT
         construct."
{08-214, m185}

[187:8.5.1p2] Add new bullet item to list after the "CRITICAL" one
  "\item LOCK or UNLOCK statement;"
{08-256r2, m184}

[191:Note 8.39+] Immediately before 8.5.5 "STAT= and ERRMSG= ...",
                 add a new subclause
  "8.5.4a LOCK and UNLOCK statements

   R862a <lock-stmt> <<is>> LOCK ( <lock-variable> [, <lock-stat-list>] )

   R862b <lock-stat> <<is>>  ACQUIRED_LOCK=<scalar-logical-variable>
                     <<or>>  <sync-stat>

   R862c <unlock-stmt> <<is>> UNLOCK ( <lock-variable> [,
                              <sync-stat-list>] )

   R862d <lock-variable>  <<is>>  <scalar-variable>

   C851a (R862d) A <lock-variable> shall be a lock variable (\ref{6.2.2
         Lock variable})

   The values of a lock variable denote the state of a lock.  A lock is
   acquired by setting the value of the lock variable to locked, and
   released by setting the value to unlocked.  A lock variable is currently
   locked by an image if its value was set to locked by that image and has
   not been subsequently set to unlocked.

   Successful execution of a LOCK statement without an ACQUIRED_LOCK=
   specifier causes the <lock-variable> to become defined with the value
   locked. If the lock variable is currently locked by a different image,
   execution of the LOCK statement completes when the lock is released by
   the other image and acquired by this image.

   If a <lock-variable> has the value unlocked, successful execution of a
   LOCK statement with an ACQUIRED_LOCK= specifier causes the
   <lock-variable> to become defined with the value locked and the value of
   the <scalar-logical-variable> to become defined with the value
   true. Otherwise, the <lock-variable> is not changed and the value of the
   <scalar-logical-variable> becomes defined with the value false.

   Successful execution of an UNLOCK statement causes the value of the
   <lock-variable> to be set to unlocked.

   An error condition occurs if the <lock-variable> in a LOCK statement is
   currently locked by the executing image. An error condition occurs if
   the <lock-variable> in an UNLOCK statement is not currently locked by
   the executing image.  If an error condition occurs during the execution
   of a LOCK or UNLOCK statement the value of <lock-variable> is not
   changed.

   NOTE 8.39a
   A lock variable is effectively defined atomically by a LOCK or UNLOCK
   statement. If LOCK statements on two images both attempt to acquire a
   lock, one will succeed and the other will either fail if an
   ACQUIRED_LOCK= specifier appears, or will wait until the lock is later
   released if an ACQUIRED_LOCK= specifier does not appear.
   [End NOTE]

   NOTE 8.39b
   An image might wait for a LOCK statement to successfully complete for
   a long period of time if other images frequently lock and unlock the
   same lock varaible.  This situation might result from executing LOCK
   statements with ACQUIRED_LOCK= specifiers inside a spin loop.
   [End NOTE]

   NOTE 8.39c
   The following example illustrates the use of LOCK and UNLOCK
   statements to manage a work queue:

   USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV

   TYPE(LOCK_TYPE) :: queue_lock[*] ! Lock to manage the work queue
   INTEGER :: work_queue_size[*]
   TYPE(Task) :: work_queue(100)[*] ! List of tasks to perform

   TYPE(Task) :: job ! Current task working on
   INTEGER :: me

   me=THIS_IMAGE()
   DO
      ! Process the next item in your work queue

      LOCK(queue_lock) ! New segment A starts
      ! This segment A is ordered with respect to
      ! segment B executed by image me-1 below because of lock exclusion
      IF(work_queue_size>0) THEN
         ! Fetch the next job from the queue
         job=work_queue(work_queue_size)
         work_queue_size=work_queue_size-1
         END IF
      UNLOCK(queue_lock) ! Segment ends
      ... ! Actually process the task

      ! Add a new task on neighbors queue:
      LOCK(queue_lock[me+1]) ! Starts segment B
      ! This segment B is ordered with respect to
      ! segment A executed by image me+1 above because of lock exclusion
      IF(work_queue_size[me+1]<SIZE(work_queue)) THEN
         work_queue_size[me+1]=work_queue_size[me+1]+1
         work_queue(work_queue_size[me+1])[me+1]=job
      END IF
      UNLOCK(queue_lock[me+1]) ! Ends segment B

   END DO
   [End NOTE]"
{08-256r2, m185}

[192:8.5.5p1+] Add new paragraph
  "If the STAT= specifier appears, successful execution of the LOCK or
   UNLOCK statements causes the specified variable to become defined with
   the value zero.  If the STAT= specifier appears in a LOCK statement and
   the <lock-variable> is currently locked by the executing image, the
   specified variable becomes defined with the value of STAT_LOCKED
   (\ref{}). If the STAT= specifier appears in an UNLOCK statement and the
   <lock-variable> has the value unlocked, the specified variable becomes
   defined with the value of STAT_UNLOCKED (\ref{}). If the STAT= specifier
   appears in an UNLOCK statement and the <lock-variable> is currently
   locked by a different image, the specified variable becomes defined with
   the value STAT_LOCKED_OTHER_IMAGE.  The constants STAT_LOCKED,
   STAT_UNLOCKED, and STAT_LOCKED_OTHER_IMAGE are defined in the intrinsic
   module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV. If a STAT= specifier appears and any other error
   occurs during execution of a LOCK or UNLOCK statement, the specified
   variable becomes defined with a positive integer value that is different
   from STAT_LOCKED, STAT_UNLOCKED, and STAT_LOCKED_OTHER_IMAGE. If an
   error occurs during execution of a LOCK or UNLOCK statement that does
   not contain the STAT= specifier, error termination of execution is
   initiated."
