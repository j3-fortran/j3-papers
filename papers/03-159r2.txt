From: Dan Nagle
Subject: Edits In Response To Public Comment #20

 J3 previously agreed that changes were needed in response to public
comment #20.  That document enumerated 15 separate individual points.
I (= MI) summarize proposed edits for the first 14 of these points, 
in which case I also include the text of the original point.

Some original text is elided.


Point 1

The J3 response to point 1 is in paper 03-135r2.


Point 4

>>4. technical comment:  The standard should allow boz-literal-
>>constants larger than the maximum integer when they are used
>>as arguments to DBLE, REAL, or CMPLX. 
>>
>J3 response to point 4 was that J3 does not agree that there
>is a problem with the description of the use of BOZ literal
>constants as arguments to the CMPLX, DBLE and REAL intrinsic
>functions, but investigation of your comment reveals that there
>is a problem with DATA: The constant ought to be interpreted

>recommend that this be repaired.

J3 response to point 4 is that upon further investigation,
we do not want to introduce this functionality
and so this change will not be made.


Point 11

The J3 response to point 11 is that upon further investigation
J3 believes that there is no problem here.  In different
scoping units a procedure may have an explicit interface
or an implicit interface.  The first sentence refers to the nature
of the interface within the procedure itself.  The second sentence
refers to the interface in a different scoping unit.


Point 14

EDITS:

343:25-26   Delete the paragraph and replace with

"Example.  Assume a processor supports 2 integer kinds 32 and 64
with integer representation methods r=2 and q=31 and q=63
respectively.  On this processor SELECTED_INT_KIND(9) has the
value 32 and SELECTED_INT_KIND(10) has the value 64."


344:12   Change '.' to 'and does not have a less precise
approximation method.'


The J3 response is to do the above edits.
