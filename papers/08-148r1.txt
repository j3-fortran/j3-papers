Subject: VALUE attribute for coarrays?
Date: 2008 May 12
References: J3/08-007r2 (WG5/N1723)


Discussion:

We did not intend to allow coarray dummy arguments to have the
VALUE attribute.  An edit is provided to make this clear.


Edit to J3/08-007r2:

[99: 5.3.18p1 C556] In the first constraint in 5.3.18 "VALUE
attribute":

Insert "that is not a coarray" at the end of the sentence.
