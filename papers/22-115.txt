Reference: 22-007

The HUGE intrinsic function is defined for arguments of enumeration
types, but the TINY intrinsic function is not.

[448:5 16.9.209p1 TINY]
After "number" include ", or first enumerator in the type definition".

[448:7 16.9.209p3 TINY]
Replace "a real scalar or array" with "scalar or array of real or
enumeration type".

[448:9-10 16.9.209p5 TINY] Replace "The" with "If X is of type real,
the". At the end of the paragraph append " If X is of enumeration type,
the result has the value of the first enumerator in the type definition.
