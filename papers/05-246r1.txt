Subject: Adding some HPF Intrinsics
Date 2005 August 5

At Delft (N1637), it was decided to add some HPF intrinsics,
specifically, a subset of the *_prefix() and *_suffix() ones.
This paper is an attempt to do so.

The functions are placed in Section 13 in alphabetical order.

N1637 omits the COPY_*(), COUNT_*(), MINVAL_*() and MAXVAL_*(),
this paper includes them because it is easy to do
and we may decide to include them.  They easily may be omitted
if desired.

IALL(), IANY(), IPARITY(), PARITY() were agreed at Delft
to be part of the BITS proposal so they are not included here.
However, they may be included here or in a separate paper
if that measure fails.

It will help the reader's understanding of these procedures
to understand Section 7.4.5 starting on page 93 of the HPF 2.0
standard document.  That language is largely, but not completely,
reproduced here as the edit at [282:18+].

The edits following are largely based upon Section 7.7
of the HPF 2.0 standard document, with some changes to fit
the language and format of 04-007.  I omit some HPF examples.

I listed these intrinsics in a new 13.5.19, because no existing
category seemed to be a very good fit.  Otherwise, perhaps 
13.5.12 or 13.5.13 are good places.  In the descriptions,
they are listed as Transformational functions.

"13.2.3 Array Prefix and Suffix Procedures

In a scan of a vector each element of the result is a function
of the elements of the vector that precede it (for a prex scan)
or that follow it (for a suffix scan).  These functions
provide scan operations on arrays and subarrays.
The functions have the general form
XXX_PREFIX( ARRAY, DIM, MASK, SEGMENT, EXCLUSIVE)
XXX_SUFFIX( ARRAY, DIM, MASK, SEGMENT, EXCLUSIVE)
except in the special cases noted below.

The allowed values of XXX are ALL, ANY, COPY, COUNT, IALL, IANY,
IPARITY, MAXVAL, MINVAL, PARITY, PRODUCT, and SUM.

When comments below apply to both prexfix and suffix forms
of the routines, we will refer to them as YYYFIX functions.

The arguments DIM, MASK, SEGMENT, and EXCLUSIVE are optional
The COPY_YYYFIX functions do not have MASK or EXCLUSIVE arguments
The ALL_YYYFIX, ANY_YYYFIX, COUNT_YYYFIX, and PARITY_YYYFIX functions
do not have MASK arguments.  Their ARRAY argument shall be
of type logical, it is denoted MASK in their specications in Section.

The arguments MASK and SEGMENT shall be of type logical.  SEGMENT shall
have the same shape as ARRAY.  MASK shall be conformable with ARRAY.
EXCLUSIVE is a logical scalar.

DIM is a scalar integer between one and the rank of ARRAY.

Result Value
The result has the same shape as ARRAY, and, with the exception
of COUNT_YYYFIX, the same type and kind type parameter as ARRAY.
The result of COUNT_YYYFIX is default integer.  In every case,
every element of the result is determined by the values
of certain selected elements of ARRAY in a way that is specific
to the particular function and is described in its specication.
The optional arguments affect the selection of elements
of ARRAY for each element of the result, the selected elements
of ARRAY are said to contribute to the result element.  This
section describes fully which elements of ARRAY contribute
to a given element of the result.

If no elements of ARRAY are selected for a given element
of the result, that result element is set to a default value that
is specific to the particular function and is described
in its specication

For any given element r of the result,
let a be the corresponding element of ARRAY.

Every element of ARRAY contributes to r unless disqualied
by one of the following rules.

If the function is XXX_PREFIX, no element that follows a
in the array element ordering of ARRAY contributes to r.
If the function is XXX_SUFFIX, no element
that precedes a in the array element ordering
of ARRAY contributes to r

If the DIM argument is provided, an element z of ARRAY
does not contribute to r unless all its indices, excepting only
the index for dimension DIM, are the
same as the corresponding indices of a.
It follows that if the DIM argument is omitted,
then ARRAY, MASK, and SEGMENT are processed in array element
order as if temporarily regarded as rank-one arrays.
If the DIM argument is present, then a family of completely
independent scan operations are carried out along
the selected dimension of ARRAY.
	
If the MASK argument is provided, an element z of ARRAY
contributes to r only if the element of MASK corresponding
to z is true.  It follows that array elements corresponding
to positions where the MASK is false do not contribute anywhere
to the result.  However, the result is nevertheless defined
at all positions, even positions where the MASK is false.

If the SEGMENT argument is provided, an element z of ARRAY
does not contribute if there is some intermediate element w
of ARRAY, possibly z itself, with all of the following properties:

 (A) If the function is XXX_PREFIX, w does not precede z but
     does precede a in the array element ordering; if the function
     is XXX_SUFFIX, w does not follow z but does follow a
     in the array element ordering,

 (B) If the DIM argument is present, all the indices of w, excepting
     only the index for dimension DIM, are the same
     as the corresponding indices of (A) and,

 (C) The element of SEGMENT corresponding to w does not have
     the same value as the element of SEGMENT corresponding to a.

In other words, z can contribute only if there is
an unbroken string of SEGMENT values, all alike,
extending from z through a.

If the EXCLUSIVE argument is provided and is true,
then a itself does not contribute to r.

These general rules lead to the following important cases:

Case (i) If ARRAY has rank one, element i of the result
         of XXX_PREFIX( ARRAY) is
         determined by the first i elements of ARRAY,
         element SIZE( ARRAY) - i + 1
         of the result of XXX_SUFFIX( ARRAY) is determined
         by the last i elements of ARRAY

Case (ii) If ARRAY has rank greater than one, then each element
          of the result of XXX_PREFIX( ARRAY) has a value
          determined by the corresponding element
          a of the ARRAY and all elements of ARRAY that precede a
          in array element order. For XXX_SUFFIX, a is determined
          by the elements of ARRAY that
          correspond to or follow a in array element order.

Case (iii) Each element of the result of XXX_PREFIX( ARRAY, MASK=MASK)
           is determined by selected elements of ARRAY,
           namely the corresponding element
           a of the ARRAY and all elements of ARRAY
           that precede a in array element order,
           but an element of ARRAY may contribute
           to the result only if the corresponding element
           of MASK is true.  If this restriction results in
           selecting no array elements to contribute to some element
           of the result, then that element of the result is
           set to the default value for the given function.

Case (iv) Each element of the result of XXX_PREFIX( ARRAY, DIM=DIM)
          is determined by selected elements of ARRAY,
          namely the corresponding element a of
          the ARRAY and all elements of ARRAY that precede
          a along dimension DIM; for example,
          in SUM_PREFIX( A( 1: N, 1: N), DIM= 2), the result element
          ( i_1, i_2) could be computed as SUM( A( i_1, 1: i_2).
          More generally, in SUM_PREFIX( ARRAY, DIM),
          result element ( i_1, i_2, ... i_DIM, ... i_n) in could be
          computed as SUM( ARRAY( i_1, i_2, :i_DIM, i_n).  (Note
          the colon before i_DIM in that last expression.)

Case (v) If ARRAY has rank one, then element i
         of the result of XXX_PREFIX( ARRAY, EXCLUSIVE= .TRUE.)
         is determined by the first i - 1 elements of ARRAY.

Case (vi) The options may be used in any combination."

               and of type integer with a value
               in the range 1 <= DIM <= n,
               where n is the rank of ARRAY.

MASK (optional) is INTENT( IN) and shall be of type logical
                and shall be conformable with ARRAY.

SEGMENT (optional) is INTENT( IN) and shall be of type logical
                   and shall have the same shape as ARRAY.

EXCLUSIVE (optional) is INTENT( IN) and shall be of type logical
                     and shall be scalar.

<<Result Characteristics.>> Same as ARRAY.

<<Result Value.>> Element r of the result has
                 the value SUM( [ a_1, ..., a_m ] )
                 where ( a_1, ..., a_m ) is the (possibly empty) set
                 of elements of ARRAY selected to contribute to r
                 by the rules stated in Section 13.2.3.

<<Example.>> SUM_SUFFIX( [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ], SEGMENT= [ F, F, F, T, T ] )
            is [ 6, 5, 3, 9, 5 ]."
