NUMBER: F08/0022
TITLE: DO CONCURRENT and file i/o.
KEYWORDS: DO CONCURRENT
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

The standard states [178:15-16] that
  "An input/output statement shall not write data to a file record or
   position in one iteration and read from the same record or position
   in a different iteration."

In the loop

  DO CONCURRENT (i=1:2)
    IF (i==1) READ(17,REC=100) x    ! (a)
    IF (i==2) WRITE(17,REC=100) y   ! (b)
  END DO

The input/output statement at (a) only reads data from the file, it
does not write it, and thus does not fall foul of this restriction.
Similar reasoning shows that the input/output statement at (b) also
obeys this restriction.

Is this fragment intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

No, the example is not intended to be standard-conforming.  An edit is
supplied to make the requirement less ambiguous.

EDITS to 10-007:

[178:15-16] In 8.1.6.7p1, penultimate bullet point, replace the whole
            sentence "An input/output ... iteration." with
  "If data are written to a file record or position in one iteration,
   that record or position in that file shall not be read from in a
   different iteration."
