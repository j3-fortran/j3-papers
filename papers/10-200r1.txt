From: Stan Whitlock/John Reid
Subject: F2008 interp re MOVE_ALLOC
Date: 2010 October 11

NUMBER: F08/0040
TITLE:  MOVE_ALLOC for coarrays
KEYWORDS: intrinsic, allocation
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Was it intended that MOVE_ALLOC be applicable to coarrays?

ANSWER:

No. A call to MOVE_ALLOC on coarrays might involve the deallocation
of a coarray;  therefore MOVE_ALLOC would need to be an image
control statement for consistency with the DEALLOCATE statement.

An edit is supplied to clarify this.

EDIT:  In 10-007

In 13.7.118 MOVE_ALLOC (FROM, TO), paragraph 3:
    [372:18] After "It shall be allocatable." add
       "It shall not be a coarray."
    [372:19] After "It shall be allocatable." add
       "It shall not be a coarray."
