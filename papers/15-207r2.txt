Introduction
------------

Paragraph 4 of 15.3.7 (Interoperability of procedures and procedure
interfaces) says (as amended by 15-200r2):

"In a reference from C to a procedure with an interoperable interface,
if a dummy argument is allocatable, assumed shape, assumed-rank, or a
pointer, the corresponding actual argument in C shall be the address
of a C descriptor for the intended effective argument. In this C
descriptor, the members other than attribute and type shall describe an
object with the same characteristics as the intended effective argument."

The first sentence attempts to summarize the situations where a C
descriptor is used to pass an argument, laid out in more detail in
15.3.7p2, but omits the case from 461:18-19:

"the dummy argument is a nonallocatable nonpointer variable of type
CHARACTER with assumed character length"

One also observes that the summary misses additional details from the
preceding text, such as that a pointer with the CONTIGUOUS attribute
is not passed by C descriptor. In general we try not to say things
twice as that almost guarantees one of them will be wrong...

The text for p4 should be revised to eliminate the redundancy. Edits
are supplied below.

[461:29-31, 15.3.7p4] Interoperability of procedures and procedure
interfaces

Replace the first sentence "In a reference from C..." with:

"In a reference from C to a Fortran procedure with an interoperable
interface, the C actual argument shall be the address of a C
descriptor for the intended effective argument if the dummy argument
corresponds to a C formal parameter of a pointer to CFI_cdesc_t."

This edit supersedes the first edit in 15-200r2.

The editor is asked to make further edits that make the last sentence
of  15.5.1p1 and any other place that tries to list the attributes,
consistent with 15.3.7
