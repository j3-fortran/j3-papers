Title: Add <access-spec> to the <prefix> for subprogram headers

Submitted by: J3

Status: For Consideration

References: 03-007r2, subclause 12.5.2.1

Basic Functionality: Add <access-spec> to the <prefix> for subprogram headers.

Rationale: For types, variables and named constants, one
can put <access-spec> on the declaration.  If the proposal
in 04-187 succeeds, one will be able to put <access-spec>
on the declaration for a generic.  This leaves procedures
and common blocks as the only module entities for which one
has to put an <access-spec> elsewhere than the definition
of the entity.  Indeed, the <access-spec> statement has to
go before the CONTAINS, which puts it distant from the
subprogram.  By now, COMMON should appear so infrequently in
modules that there's no point to change the syntax of its
declaration to provide for an <access-spec>.  Since common
blocks can be declared by several COMMON statements, it may
not be possible to put <access-spec> on COMMON statements
and still describe them with a reasonable number of words.


Estimated Impact: Trivial.


Detailed Specification: Add <<or>> <access-spec> to the list of right-hand-sides
for <prefix-spec> (R1228 in 03-007r2).
