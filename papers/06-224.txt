Date:    28-jul-2006

---------------------

Unresolved Technical Issue 64 (page 376) notes that there is no entry
for type BITS in the table of default boundary values to the used if
the BOUNDARY argument to EOSHIFT is not present. This omission was an
oversight.

Edits:
-----

[376:12-] In the table at the end of the description of the optional
BOUNDARY argument for EOSHIFT, in the column headed "Type of ARRAY"
add a new entry "Bits" and in the same row in the column headed "Value
of BOUNDARY" add "b'0'".
