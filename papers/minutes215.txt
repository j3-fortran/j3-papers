             Minutes for J3 Meeting 215
             ==========================

1. Monday, February 12, 2018  8:00 am
-------------------------------------
1.1 Opening business                              D. Nagle
       Remarks from the chair                     D. Nagle
       Adoption of agenda                         D. Nagle
         Clune/Snyder : UC
       Approval of Meeting 214 minutes            D. Nagle
         Steidel / Klimowicz : UC
       INCITS/OMC report (if any)                 D. Nagle
         No news
       WG23 report (if any)                       D. Nagle
        Gary attended most recent teleconference, but did
          not actively engage
       J11 Liaison report (if any)                D. Nagle
         CPlex is winding down as J11 has accepted it.
       MPI Liaison report (if any)                B. Long
         FP16 support (128 byte)

         Fault tolerance discussions on whose responsibility it should be
         to clean up certain resources. Agreement that users would have
         to do at least some cleanup, since MPI does not have enough
         information to do everything.

         Exascale Computing Program: MPI survey showed Fortran losing
         some ground. Ideally use of coarrays contributed, though
         probably use of C++ and Python was the bigger reason.

       SHMEM bonus report                         B. Long
         The Fortran interface for Shmem is moving to an Annex. Will be
         completely rewritten using more modern Fortran. Plans include
         C interop to call the C library, a module (replaces the include
         file), and getting rid of the "Cray pointer" declarations and
         symmetric memory allocator, replacing them with coarrays.

       OpenMP Liaison report (if any)             B. Long
         TR6: OpenMP 5.0 Preview 2 was released during
         Supercomputing 2017. This will be the final preview release
         before the final OpenMP 5.0 release in November 2018.

         TR6 added the following new features (from press release):

            - Support for multilevel memory systems: OpenMP 5.0 will
              include memory allocation mechanisms that intuitively
              place data in different kinds of memories;

            - Support for descriptive loop optimizations: The
              concurrent construct asserts that all iterations of the
              associated loop nest may be executed concurrently in any
              order, which will enable many implementation-specific
              compiler optimizations;

         Since the release of TR6, the language committee has continued
         to discuss further improvements for the upcoming 5.0 release.
         Topics include:

            - Explicitly list all new Fortran 2008 features that may
              result in unspecified behavior when used in OpenMP programs
              (only CONTIGUOUS attribute has specified behavior)

            - Add clause for controlling task affinity

            - Explicitly list all new C++17 features that may result in
              unspecified behavior when used in OpenMP programs.


       UPC/PGAS Liaison report (if any)                B. Friesen
          DOE continues to show interest in UPC and related PGAS software
          for exascale computing. The DOE Exascale Computing
          Project (ECP) is funding the Pagoda Project at LBNL, which
          consists of GASNet-Ex, a communication layer, and UPC++, a
          C++-based interface. ECP hopes to integrate UPC++ into some of
          the applications which will run on the first generation of
          exascale computers in the US.
       OpenACC Liaison report (if any)            G. Klimowicz
         OpenACC 2.6 was approved. New features include
            - Support for manual deep copy. Codes that heavily rely on
              derived types no longer have to be decomposed into their
              parts to be moved to the device.
            - Unified memory support, which simplifies memory management
              further. Many applications perform well without having to
              manually manage memory to the device.
            - Serial compute construct which allows the programmer
              to specify a sequence of serial code that can be moved to
              the device, even though it doesn't necessarily perform well
              on the device. This can alleviate the need to move data to
              and from the device, improving performance overall.
            - acc_get_property intrinsic that allows the programmer to
              identify things like how much memory is available on the
              device.
            - IF and IF_PRESENT clauses in HOST_DATA construct to allow
              applications that run on systems without GPUDirect to use
              the same code as those that do. Simplifies running on
              different configurations of hardware.

         The Fifth OpenACC User Group meeting will be held at GTC 2018
         March 27 7:30 PM at the Four Points Sheraton in San Jose CA.
         https://www.eventbrite.com/e/fifth-openacc-user-group-meeting
                 -gtc-2018-march-27-tickets-42608751924

         They are seeking additions to the OpenACC runtime library for
         OpenACC 2.7, including use cases for the benefits of such
         proposals.

       Comments from members
         Bill noted that Makki's wife has passed. maybe at WG5 we should
         have some sort of statement

       WG5; most of you have seen N2147, the user survey.  At this meeting
       we should start to come up with a list of proposed features for
       next standard.  Steve's goal is to streamline the process.
       Looking for 2-3 medium/large features, small number of small
       features, and get the standard out there faster than 10 years.
       Proposal;  Everyone look over N2147 and associated sources of
       feature requests.   Two rose to the top; generics, exceptions.
       Come up with 5 other things you think are worth doing, and
       email Steve.  we'll discuss the list tomorrow.  Hopefully there
       will be a list of 20+/- items to bring to WG5 in June.
        Proposal: Use a J3 standing document to keep track of all the
       requests

       Two tasks; get a list to Steve, get our votes straight for DIS
       There are some technical issues that Bill discovered.
       If these are minor changes, 1 month letter ballot with wg5
       If these are major changes, need to reset FDIS


1.2 Tutorials (if needed)
       Steve presented the new web site, made sure everyone could
       log in, in preparation for future meetings.

3.1 F2015 Plenary (13-010)                        Subgroup Heads

      Note:  Straw Votes are marked with SV:, and the results are
             listed as  YES / NO / (no opinion)

      /JOR:
           18-109 "Use case for error handling ugliness" and
           18-115 "Exception handling in Fortran"
           After a brief discussion, the committee agrees with goals of
           these papers, but much concern about implementation.
           JOR will recommend to WG5.

      /DATA:
           18-113r1 "New types, not type aliases, from old types"

           18-123 w/18-110r1 "Distilled issues for container use cases"
             Containers would not be the intrinsic thing, the intrinsic
           thing would be a means to develop containers.
           Committee to come up with enabling technologies.

      /HPC:
           18-117r1 "Put with notify"  will continue

3.3 Subgroup meetings
3.4 Subgroup reports (4:30 pm)
     /JoR:
      Subgroup suggests these features from 18-122r1 are low priority:
     "An ability to declare a reduction variable on DO CONCURRENT. "
     "+= and *= syntax"

      Subgroup also suggests that the following features from 18-122r1
        not go forward:
      "A SWAP_ALLOCS procedure", "Strengthening existing intrinsics, i.e.
      avoiding special processing of corner cases" and "Standardizing

4.1 F2015 Plenary (13-010)                        Subgroup Heads
    Answer the question;  Should we go forward with this?
    straw votes:  For forward - Never look at it again - don't care

     /JOR
       18-124  "Increase maximum line length"
               SV:  10 - 0 - 3
       18-125  "Asynchronous subroutine execution"
               Discussion items:  Seems like a lot of potential issues
               with race conditions on arguments in the concurrently
               executing code. EVENT WAIT has segment boundary side
               effects - waiting for otherwise unrelated memory transfer
               completions. Lots of Data edits would be needed.
               Can OpenMP tasks work here?  Also like Ada tasks.
               SV:  8 - 0 - 5
       18-126  "A0 format data edit descriptor"
               Paper had two other straw votes, listed here:
                 Should G0 change if A0 added? Yes:1 - No:6 - Undecided:6
                 Should A0 include Adjustl? Y:1 - N:5 - U:7
               Should we go forward with A0? SV:  7 - 0 - 6
       18-127  "Additional string intrinsics"
               Discussion items:How is sprintf different from an internal
               file? Seems like a list of intrinsics that would not be
               new.  String handling not a major area for Fortran usage.
               New intrinsics in paper have potential name conflicts
               with existing user names
               SV:  7 - 1 - 5
       18-120r2 "Control of leading zero in F and E format"
               Discussion item: Gives a way for a user to remove a
               processor dependency.
               SV:  9 - 0 - 4

     /DATA
       18-128 - "Associating REAL and COMPLEX entities"
                Discussion points: Violates tenet that pointers can't
                point to different types.  F77 codes in paper were
                illegal, even if in common practice.
                  Sent back to subgroup to find solution that doesn't
                violate basic Fortran rules.  No further action this
                meeting.

       18-130 - "Extending usability of deferred-length strings"
                This was broken up into three subcategories.
                For ERRMSG, IOMSG discussion items: Conceptually
                attractive, but likely to result in a lot of copying.
                May be too much work for vendors.
                   SV: (ERRMSG/IOMSG only)      10-2-1

                For intrinsics that return strings:
                   SV: 7 - 0 - 6
                For write to an internal file: Definitely may result
                in performance issues with much copying between
                buffers.
                   SV: 7 - 0 - 6
       18-132  "Use cases for unsigned integers"
                Discussion points: lack of unsigned integers is considered
                an advantage in some applications.  Interoperability
                can use signed integers without problems now.  Adding a
                new type will affect entire underlying typing system;
                use case better addressed by BITS. Questions about
                arithmetic semantics.
                   SV: 1 - 5 - 7
       18-133  "RANGE attribute and statement"
                  Not to be brought forward
       18-134  "Type- or object-bound function invocation on, subobject"
                Discussion: This means having a part name in a designator
                being a function reference.  Suggested that parsing would
                not be straightforward.  Obvious workaround in the paper
                   SV: 3 - 0 - 10

       (Damian Rouson had to leave, changing the total to 12)

       18-135  "Use cases for unallocated list item in READ statement"
                This was broken out from allocatables in ERRMSG, IOMSG.
                Discussion items:  Definite performance issue, as it
                would require double-reading.   Appreciate the goal, but
                seems unrealistic.  List directed could be a problem.
                Format reversion would be a problem. Simple would be
                valuable, but complicated could be very complicated
                   SV:  0 - 8 - 4

       18-136r1  "Use cases for default value for optional argument"
                Discussion items: Contrary to providing SAVE attribute.
                Easy enough workaround in code at top of routine.
                Possible problem passing argument to another routine
                that is expecting an optional - would the default be sent
                or the original, non-present?
                   SV:  6 - 4 - 2

        18-137 "fixing broken paragraphs"
               New for US TAG, with editorial changes.

     /HPC
       18-131 "HPC Subgroup feature recommendations"
        There are many line items in this paper; individual items have
        been called out below, with its associated straw vote.
        Reminder:  SV:  Go Forward / Do not take forward / Undecided

         Medium size features:
         Put with notify (paper 18-117r1)
             SV: 6/0/6
         Binary compatibility of C descriptors so that a single C library
         could work with multiple Fortran implementations. (Discussion:
         there are other solutions possible)
            SV: 11/0/1

         Small size features:
         CFI function to return text of error messages
            SV: 10/0/2
         Any information that can help avoid OpenMP false sharing, e.g.
         intrinsics to inquire about cache sizes, and other hardware
         features at run time.
            SV: 1/10/1
         Processor dependent information on sizes of vector
         instruction, that helps arrange data in an optimal
         fashion for SIMD processing.
            SV: 1/8/3
         PROTECTED structure components
            SV: 8/1/3

         Neither recommended nor opposed:
         Providing methods for easily accepting NUL-terminated strings
         in calls to Fortran from C.
            SV: 7/0/5
         Allow more than one procedure interface to share the same
         binding name (currently disallowed by 19.2p1)
            SV: 0/7/5
         Allow arrays and allocatables with coarray components
         (paper 17-200r1)
            SV: 4/0/7
         Bit strings. There are two options. Length is LEN or
         a KIND parameter. Debated before, chose KIND. (discussion:
         could be used to resolve unsigned integer)
            SV: 8/0/4

         Features that are not recommended:
         An INTENT keyword that means the same as not specifying INTENT.
            SV: 7/2/3
         Proposal for requesting different memory types for different
         data objects. (paper 18-118)
            SV: 0/9/3
         Remove requirement that LOGICAL requires one numeric storage
         unit. After discussion, proposal was changed to augment
         ISO_FORTRAN_ENV with LOGICAL kind types LOG8, LOG16, LOG32,
         LOG64. Also, while editing, add REAL16 as well (where the
         numbers indicate number-of-bits)
            SV: 10/0/2
         PROTECTED types:  Discussion: EVENT and LOCK and NOTIFY should
         be recharacterized as protected types.  Maybe a different term?
            SV: 2/0/10
         PROTECTED pointers, similar to a pointer-to-const in C/C++:
            SV: 5/0/7

--------------------------------------
5.1 F2015 Plenary (13-010)                       Subgroup Heads
   Two more members have left:  Anton Shterenlikht, Van Snyder

      /JoR
      18-139 "Degree trigonometric functions"
          Discussion: Remove hyperbolic, some massaging,
          but agree with the thrust
            SV: 9 - 0 - 1
      18-140 "Pointers should be disassociated by default"
            SV: 6 - 3 - 1
      18-143 "Add reductions to DO CONCURRENT"
            SV: 5 - 0 - 5

      18-152 "short circuiting logical operators"
          Discussed precedence; group decision to keep it as lowest
            SV: 8 - 0 - 2

      /DATA
      18-141  "Specification variables"
         idea is good, will be needed for templates
          We should work on this as part of generics, where the
         feature would be useful but not necessarily in this format.
            SV: 0 - 7 - 3


      18-142 "Data recommendations on Containers"
          Note; the recommendation is to NOT do containers
            SV: 10 -0 - 0
          "Containers" as a feature will not be brought forward

      18-144 "POINTER dummy arguments, INTENT, and target modification"
          Discussion; typo in paper "target" should be "pointer"
          in P2.  Use a term other than INTENT
            SV: 7 - 0 - 3

      18-149  "Protection"
             (protected components was separated into 18-146;
              argument pointer targets is 18-144)
              This discusses PROTECTED types only.
            SV: 0 - 6 - 4

      18-151 "VIRTUOUS or Super-pure attribute for functions"
         Discussion: No contact with data defined outside the function
         "four walls".  Module version cannot access module variables.
         Intention is that routine can be run on a co-processor without
         access to host memory.  Compiler/code-gen should be able to
         detect this even without attribute
            SV: 5 - 0 - 5

      18-153  "Views-lite (an example of how views could do real/complex)"
            SV: 0 - 4 - 6

      18-114r1 "Enumeration types"
         Discussion: Some value but expensive in compiler because
         type system affected. No operators or semantics.  If limited to
         a bind(c) feature, would lessen its value
            SV: 6 - 0 - 4

       There are four line-items from 18-122r1 that were not addressed.
        Constructors - Tom would like to consider use cases,
           perhaps submit a paper later.
        Panoramic views - To pursue it, write the paper for next meeting
        Declarations in implicit <block-construct> - No paper now; maybe
           later
        Units - WG5 has turned it down, not worth submitting another paper

      /HPC
      18-145 "CFI function to return error texts"
            SV: 9 - 0 - 1

      18-146  "Protected components:
            SV: 7 - 0 - 3

      18-147  "Intrinsics to convert C string and Fortran string"
            SV: 7 - 0 - 3

      18-148 "Logical kinds, another real kind"
            SV: 10 - 0 - 0

      18-150 "Intent to specify no intent"
            SV: 7 - 0 - 3

      At the end of the meeting, we decided that Steve would gather
      the results of the various straw votes taken, and will submit
      a summary report.

      The items the committee are confident should be brought
      forward are generic programming/templates, and exception
      handling.

      One should note that a simple recommendation from this committee
      does not guarantee that a feature will be accepted by WG5.
