Subject: Nonelemental IEEE subroutines

1. Introduction

In the IEEE TR, the routines
  IEEE_SET_FLAG
  IEEE_SET_HALTING_MODE
are described as being (pure and) elemental.  However, in the F2003 FCD,
they are described as being impure.

This is an inconsistency between the TR and the standard.  We promised
only to make changes to the facilities described by the TR if they were
necessary (i.e. there was an error in the TR).  In the discussion below
it is explained
- why these procedures cannot be elemental (and therefore that there is
  an error in the TR),
- that these procedures can be pure.

Making these procedures impure as well as nonelemental is a larger
inconsistency than is needed simply to fix the error (and one which
will likely adversely affect existing user programs) and thus in
breach of our promise.  Restoring their purity will restore the
possibility of doing exception handling in a procedure called from a
FORALL.

Therefore we propose to reinstate the purity of these procedures.

Other flaws were discovered during the investigation of this problem,
and fixes are proposed for those too.

2. Why can these routines not be elemental?

Because

   CALL IEEE_SET_FLAG( (/ IEEE_OVERFLOW,IEEE_OVERFLOW /), &
                       (/ .TRUE.,.FALSE. /) )

would have ill-defined semantics.  Similarly for IEEE_SET_HALTING_MODE.

3. When was this change made?

At meeting J3/160, by paper 01-138r2, item 39.

In the discussion on this paper, the above reason for them not being
elemental was made, however, that is not the reason given in the paper,
which simply claims that these routines "have side effects" and
therefore cannot be pure.

This reasoning is ill-founded, because it is not possible to use these
routines in any way that would create a side effect prohibited by the
purity rules.

(In a way, the wrong question was being asked.  The right question is
"can one use IEEE_SET_FLAG or IEEE_SET_HALTING_MODES to create a
[prohibited] side-effect", and the answer to that question is "no", as
shown below.)

4. The purity rules and the IEEE state

The purity rules are designed not to prohibit all side-effects
(C.S. terminology);  indeed all useful pure subroutines have
side-effects (that being all that a subroutine can do).

The purity rules were designed (by HPFF) to prevent dependencies between
instances of a procedure in parallel execution (FORALL or WHERE), thus
preventing nondeterminism and race conditions.

The IEEE TR carefully defined the semantics of the IEEE state (flags and
modes) and the information/effect flow thereof in such a manner as to
prevent the "effects" from being (HPFF-style) "side-effects".

That is, far from being simple global variables, the IEEE flags and
modes in Fortran are more like implicit arguments (but defined in such a
manner as to facilitate the use of the hardware-provided registers in
their implementation).

5. Purity of IEEE_SET_FLAG

It is fairly easy to see that IEEE_SET_FLAG must be PURE, because it
does not do anything that arithmetic does not do.  All it does is set
the IEEE flags.  So if IEEE_SET_FLAG were considered to be "impure",
then arithmetic (which also sets the flags and does more besides) must
be doubly impure!  For example
   PURE FUNCTION F(X,Y)
     INTENT(IN) X,Y
     F = X/Y
   END
invoked with X==huge and Y==tiny will set IEEE_OVERFLOW, etc.

We can see that this does not cause a problem (either for arithmetic
or for IEEE_SET_FLAG) by considering the information flow.  For the
flags, this is upwards only - a called procedure can set a flag and
this is apparent in the caller, but the called procedure cannot see
which flags of the caller are set (they all appear to be quiet).

This means that IEEE flag setting does not transmit information
downwards, nor "sideways" (that is, to other instances of the same
procedure at the same invocation level within a FORALL).

6. Purity of IEEE_SET_HALTING_MODE

The IEEE halting mode information flows downwards only - setting the
halting mode in the called procedure does not affect the mode in the
caller - thus it is not possible to use IEEE_SET_HALTING_MODE to cause a
side-effect.

7. Optimisation effects

IEEE_SET_FLAG actually has no effect on optimisation whatsoever (it is
IEEE_GET_FLAG which has the effect, if it is used), because any
(floating-point) arithmetic operation sets the flags anyway.

IEEE_SET_HALTING_MODE has an effect on optimisation inside the routine
in which it is called (because the processor usually needs to save and
restore the modes on entry and exit).  It can have little effect on
optimisation outside of that routine because
(i) the compiler almost never knows with what halting-mode settings a
    procedure is invoked anyway,
(ii) if the effect of changing the halting modes is to cause the program
     to terminate instead of proceeding normally, the program was not
     standard-conforming ("halting" is an "abort", not a well-defined
     means of stopping).

8. Other wording problems

1) As defined, IEEE_GET_FLAG is merely an expensive way of setting
LOGICAL variables to .FALSE., since the flags were all set quiet on
entry to IEEE_GET_FLAG (see [365:37-38]).  We get this right for the
other routines that need "magic" exceptions from this sort of thing, viz
the mode setting routines (see last sentence of 14.3, last sentence of
second paragraph of 14.4 and the last sentence of 14.5), so we ought to
get it right for this one too.

2) There is a typo "IEEE_SET_HALTING" for "IEEE_SET_HALTING_MODE".

3) The information about the purity of the intrinsic subroutine
MOVE_ALLOC is buried in the text; it would be clearer if it appeared in
the subroutine description as well.  This applies to IEEE_SET_FLAG and
IEEE_SET_HALTING_MODE too.

9. Edits to 03-007r2

[337:29] Change "Subroutine" to "Pure subroutine".
{So the user can tell the purity from the routine description.}

[365:37] After "procedure"
         insert "other than IEEE_GET_FLAG or IEEE_GET_STATUS".
{Text modelled on the similar text for the other magic procedures near
the ends of 14.3, 14.4 and 14.5.}

[366:11] "IEEE_SET_HALTING" -> "IEEE_SET_HALTING_MODE".
{Typo.}

[371:8+] Insert new paragraph
  "The nonelemental subroutines IEEE_SET_FLAG and IEEE_SET_HALTING_MODE
   are pure.  No other nonelemental subroutine contained in IEEE_EXCEPTIONS
   is pure."
{Say that IEEE_SET_FLAG and IEEE_SET_HALTING_MODE are pure, and that
none of the others are pure.}

[371:13+] Insert new paragraph
  "No nonelemental subroutine contained in IEEE_ARITHMETIC is pure."
{Make the lack of purity explicit.}

[378:25,33] Change "Subroutine" to "Pure subroutine", twice.
{So the user can tell the purity from the routine description.}
