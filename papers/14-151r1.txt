Discussion
----------

We currently have two ways to identify an ancestor team, TEAM and
DISTANCE. We use TEAM in an image selector, e.g., A[TEAM :: i,j], in
SYNC_IMAGES, and in FAILED_IMAGES. We use DISTANCE in TEAM_ID,
NUM_IMAGES, and THIS_IMAGE. The intrinsic GET_TEAM provides
conversion to TEAM. There is no conversion to DISTANCE, though it
would be easy to extend TEAM_DEPTH to do this.

DISTANCE is intrinsically unsafe because an ancestor team may be at
different team distances on executing images of different teams. We
think that TEAM should be used in TEAM_ID, NUM_IMAGES, and THIS_IMAGE.
This makes TEAM_DEPTH redundant.

GET_TEAM with the argument DISTANCE absent plays the useful role of
providing a team variable for the current team and there are examples
illustrating this. Beyond that, we believe GET_TEAM should support the
most relevant cases of supplying the parent team and the initial team;
alternatively, if a team variable appears in an image selector for a
dummy coarray, it can be made available as another argument or by use
or host association. We therefore propose the replacement of the
optional argument DISTANCE in GET_TEAM by LEVEL with three possible
integer values in ISO_FORTRAN_ENV: INITIAL_TEAM, PARENT_TEAM,
CURRENT_TEAM.

These changes mean that team depth will be removed entirely from the
syntax. It remains a useful concept in the text.

From the addition of sibling team addressing via the TEAM_ID
keyword (5.4), it follows that some intrinsic support is needed for
reliably obtaining results from IMAGE_INDEX and NUM_IMAGES when
such addressing occurs. It seems best to provide three overloaded
versions, one with an argument TEAM, one with an argument TEAM_ID, and
one without either of these.

In his vote (see N2013), Van Snyder says

"Since TEAM_TYPE is not prohibited in a variable definition context,
GET_TEAM could be a function instead of a subroutine.  This would be
handy for passing team variables as actual arguments."

This paper also contains edits to implement this.

Edits to N2007:
---------------

[9:30+] Add paragraph
"The integer constants INITIAL_TEAM, PARENT_TEAM, and CURRENT_TEAM
are used to specify a team to the intrinsic function GET_TEAM. They
are defined in in the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV."

[11:12+] In note 5.2, change the line involving GET_TEAM to
     INITIAL = GET_TEAM()

[17:5] Delete "TEAM_DEPTH,".

[17:9] Before "MOVE_ALLOC", insert "IMAGE_INDEX, "

[24:20-31] Replace by

"<7.4.13 GET_TEAM([LEVEL])>

<Description.> Team value.

<Class.>  Transformational function.

<Argument.> LEVEL (optional) shall be a scalar with one of
the values INITIAL_TEAM, PARENT_TEAM, and CURRENT_TEAM defined in the
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module. It is an INTENT(IN) argument.

<Result Characteristics.> Scalar and of type TEAM TYPE defined in the
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module.

<Result Value> The result is the value of a team variable of the
current team if LEVEL is not present, LEVEL is present with the value
CURRENT_TEAM, or the current team is the initial team. Otherwise, the
result is the value of a team variable of the parent team if LEVEL is
present with the value PARENT_TEAM, and of the initial team if LEVEL
is present with the value INITIAL_TEAM."

[24:37] Change line to
    WORLD_TEAM = GET_TEAM()

[25:40] Replace "DISTANCE" by "TEAM".

[25:43] Replace line by
TEAM (optional) shall be a scalar of the type TEAM_TYPE defined in the
      ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module. Its value shall represent an
      ancestor team.

[26:2-6] Replace paragraph by
<<Result Value.>> If TEAM is present, the result has the value of the
team identifier of the invoking image in the team specified by the
value of TEAM; otherwise, the result value is the team identifier of
the invoking image in the current team.

[26:20+] Insert
"7.5.1- IMAGE_INDEX
The description of the intrinsic function IMAGE_INDEX in ISO/IEC
1539-1:2010 is changed by adding two overloaded additional versions
that specify the team with the argument TEAM or the argument TEAM_ID,
and a modified result if either of these versions is invoked.

The TEAM argument shall be a scalar of the type TEAM_TYPE defined in the
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module. Its value shall represent an ancestor
team.

The TEAM_ID argument shall be a nonnegative scalar integer. Its value
shall be that of a team identifier for one of the teams that were formed
by the execution of a FORM TEAM statement for the current team."

[27:6-7] Replace "two optional arguments ... present." by
"the optional argument FAILED and two overloaded additional versions
that specify the team with the argument TEAM or the argument TEAM_ID,
and a modified result if any of these versions is invoked.".

[27:8-11] Replace paragraph by
The TEAM argument shall be a scalar of the type TEAM_TYPE defined in the
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module. Its value shall represent an ancestor
team.

The TEAM_ID argument shall be a nonnegative scalar integer. Its value
shall be that of a team identifier for one of the teams that were formed
by the execution of a FORM TEAM statement for the current team.

[27:17] Replace "DISTANCE" by "TEAM" twice.

[27:18-22] Replace paragraph by
The TEAM argument shall be a scalar of the type TEAM_TYPE defined in
the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module. If TEAM is present, the result
is the image index that the invoking image has in
the team specified by the value of TEAM; otherwise, the result value is
the image index of the invoking image in the current team.

[34:14+]  Change the entry for GET_TEAM to
    GET_TEAM    ([LEVEL])    T    Team value.

[34:14+] Delete the table entry for TEAM_DEPTH, and in the table entry
for TEAM_ID, delete "[,DISTANCE]".

"IMAGE_INDEX  T   (COARRAY, SUB) or (COARRAY, SUB, TEAM) or
(COARRAY, SUB, TEAM_ID)" T  I  T  Convert cosubscripts to image index"

[34:18] Replace "([DISTANCE, FAILED])" by "{\ul ([FAILED]) or
    (TEAM[, FAILED]) or (TEAM_ID[, FAILED]) }"

[34:19] Replace "DISTANCE" by "TEAM".

        of the specified team. Otherwise, it shall be established in
        the specified team.

{In 13.7.79 IMAGE_INDEX, add the arguments descriptions as follows}
TEAM   shall be a scalar of the type TEAM_TYPE defined in the
       ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module. It is an INTENT(IN) argument.
       Its value shall represent an ancestor team.
