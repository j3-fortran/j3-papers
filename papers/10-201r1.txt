NUMBER: F08/0041
TITLE:  Segment ordering rules
KEYWORDS: segment, allocation
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

(1) Was it intended to allow the allocation of a variable that is not
    a subobject of a coarray to be unordered with respect to its
    definition by another image through a pointer component of a
    coarray?

For example,

  PROGRAM example1
    TYPE t1
      REAL,ALLOCATABLE :: c(:)
    END TYPE
    TYPE t2
      TYPE(t2),POINTER :: p
    END TYPE
    TYPE(t1),TARGET :: x
    TYPE(t2) :: y[*]
    y%p => x                         ! y[n]%p => x[n] for all n.
    SYNC ALL
    IF (THIS_IMAGE()==1) THEN
      ALLOCATE(x%c(1000))            ! Allocates x[1]%c.
    ELSE
      y[1]%p%c(THIS_IMAGE()) = 999   ! Defines some part of x[1]%c.
    END IF
  END PROGRAM

(2) If a variable is already defined (initially or by some segment
    that precedes all other segments in this question), may one image
    reference it while another image causes it to become undefined in
    unordered segments?

For example, is

  PROGRAM example2
    REAL :: x(100)[*]
    x = 1
    SYNC ALL
    IF (THIS_IMAGE()==1) THEN
      PRINT *,SUM(x)
    ELSE
      CALL destroy(x)
    END IF
  CONTAINS
    SUBROUTINE destroy(x)
      REAL,INTENT(OUT) :: x(:)
    END SUBROUTINE
  END PROGRAM

standard-conforming?  This does not appear to violate any of the
segment ordering requirements in 8.5.2 because it is not defined in
any unordered segment (so bullet 1 does not apply), there is no
allocation or pointer association status (so bullet 2 does not apply),
and there is no dummy argument being defined (so bullet 3 does not
apply).

ANSWER:

(1) No, this example violates the requirement of the first bullet in
    paragraph 3 of 8.5.2, which says:
      "if a variable is defined on an image in a segment, it shall not
       be referenced, defined, or become undefined in a segment on
       another image unless the segments are ordered".
    x[1]%c is defined in segment 2 by images 2-N, but is made
    undefined on image 1 (allocation makes a variable undefined except
    when default initialization occurs).

(2) No, this example was not intended to be standard-conforming.  An
    edit is supplied to clarify the intent.

EDITS to 10-007:

[189:14] In 8.5.2 paragraph 3, first bullet point,
  After "if a variable is defined"
  Insert "or becomes undefined"
  (before "on an image in a segment").
{Forbid uncoordinated undefinings of variables.}
