Subject:  The POS= specifier in a data transfer statement

Introduction
------------
In 9.5.1.10, it is said (at page 190, lines 14-15 of the Committee
Draft) that the POS= specifier "may appear only in an input/output
statement that specifies a unit connected for stream access".
This is not quite true.

It's correct that the POS= specifier may appear in a data transfer
statement that specifies a unit connected for stream access, and
that it may not appear in any other data transfer statement.
However, it may also appear in an INQUIRE statement, whether or
not that INQUIRE statement specifies a unit connected for stream
access.


Proposed Edits
--------------
Page and line numbers refer to the Committee Draft.

[190:14-15]  Replace the sentence "This specifier may ... access."
  with the following sentence:
    This specifier may appear in a data transfer statement only if
    the statement specifies a unit connected for stream access.
