From: Robert Corbett
Subject: IMPLICIT in BLOCK constructs
Date: 2017 October 12
Reference: 17-007r2

1. Discussion

The draft standard 17-007r2 includes an inadvertent language extension,
namely, it allows IMPLICIT statements in BLOCK constructs.  The
semantics of the extension are unclear in some cases and undesirable in
others.  A edit is provided to remove the extension.

2. Edit to 17-007r2

[186:8] 11.1.4 BLOCK construct, p1
        Delete "[ implicit-part ]".
