This is a revision of N1529.

Three of the new intrinsic functions addded at the previous
J3/WG5 meeting are, in my opinion, more appropriate in the
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module than as intrinsics.  This paper addresses
that and some issues that came up while looking at that.  The
four parts of this paper are more or less independent.  Any
combination of the four parts could plausibly be passed with
at most minor adjustments in the other parts.

I. Simplify organization of 13.8.2

  The 13.8.2.x subheadings don't add much in my opinion; I think
  them of negative value.  They just make the important stuff
  harder to find.  They don't stand out well from the next level
  of subheadings under them.  Indeed, because of the
  capitalization conventions, the 13.8.2.x.x subheadings look
  more prominent than the 13.8.2.x ones.  The text in the
  13.8.2.x.0 sections is mostly fluff and wouldn't be missed;
  only the xrefs from it seem worth keeping.  Therefore:

  EDITS:

  [361:29-31] Delete subsection 13.8.2.1, including its heading
  and body, but not including the subsections below it.

  [362:3,7,11] Before "." insert " (9.4)".  (3 times)

  [362:13-15] Delete subsection 13.8.2.2, including its heading
  and body, but not including the subsections below it.

  [362:18,22] After "specifier" insert " (9.10.4)".  (twice)

  [362:25-27] Delete subsection 13.8.2.3, including its heading
  and body, but not including the subsections below it.

  [362:1-363:3] Alphabetize and appropriately renumber all the
  13.8.2.x.x subsections.

  [361:28+] Insert the following, depending on whether or not
  parts 2 and/or 3 of this paper pass.

    If part 2 or 3 of this paper passes, then insert a section
    heading

      "13.8.2.1 Named constants in the module"

    If neither part 2 nor 3 passes, do not insert the heading
    because we should not have a 13.8.2.1 without a 13.8.2.2.
    (That's an ISO guideline that we don't follow as consistently
    as we should.)  Instead, promote all the 13.8.2.x.x
    subsections up one level.

    In either case, insert the following para, either as the sole
    para of 13.8.2.1 or as an additional para of 13.8.2.

      "The processor shall provide the named contants described
       in the following subclauses."

II. Move the new functions.

  The IS_IOSTAT_END and IS_IOSTAT_EOR functions seem quite
  appropriate for ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.  They concern system-dependent
  aspects of the Fortran I/O environment.  Indeed, they are so
  closely tied to the IOSTAT_END and IOSTAT_EOR constants that I
  can't figure out any good justification for them not to be in
  the same module as the constants.  The only "justification" I
  can think of is one that I wouldn't classify as good: if
  someone thinks that we shouldn't have procedures in intrinsic
  modules, then they are a bit late for that objection - we'd
  have to substantially redo the IEEE_* and ISO_C_BINDING
  modules.

  The NEW_LINE function also inquires about a system-dependent
  aspect of the Fortran I/O environment, fitting well with the
  other things in ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.

  EDITS:

  [235:2] "intrinsic" -> "module"

  [363:3+] Insert new subsection (it will be either 13.8.2.2 or
  13.8.2.4, depending on whether or not part 1 passes)

    "13.8.2.x Procedures in the module

       The processor shall provide the module procedures described
       in the following subclauses."

  [327:2-15] Move these (13.8.7.57-58) into the new 13.8.2.x
  in alphabetic order.

  [341:14-26] Move this (13.8.7.85) into the new 13.8.2.x
  in alphabetic order.

  [394:Note 15.3] The xref for NEW_LINE will automatically
  renumber.

  [298:17] Delete line for NEW_LINE

  [300:10-11] Delete lines for IS_IOSTAT_END and IS_IOSTAT_EOR.

III. Move other procedures

  This also seems like an appropriate time to review whether
  COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT, GET_COMMAND, GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT, and
  GET_ENVIRONMENT also belong in ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.  I think they
  do, but I probably suggested that before and failed to generate
  enough support to make it happen.  However, the decision might
  well be different when looking at the standard as an integrated
  (well, as much as we can) whole than it was when looking at the
  individual procedures.  I'm not sure that we ever stepped back
  and looked at that larger picture of integration.  Can anyone
  look at a procedure named GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE and fail
  to wonder why it isn't in the module named ISO_FORTRAN_ENV?

  Note that putting these procedures in the module would not
  invalidate any existing early implementations that might
  already provide them as intrinsics; it would still be valid for
  an implementation to have them both ways, with the intrinsic
  procedure version as a processor-defined intrinsic.  One widely
  used existing implementation (f2kcli) already does these
  procedures in a module.

  In the abstract, I'd also think that module a good place for
  CPU_TIME, DATE_AND_TIME, and SYSTEM_CLOCK, but it doesn't seem
  worth either the incompatibility with f90/f95 or the
  complication of doing them both ways, so I don't propose that.

  EDITS:

  [300:4,6.5-9] Delete the lines for COMMAND_ARGUMENT_COUNT,
  GET_COMMAND, GET_COMMAND_ARGUMENT, and GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE.

  [310:17] This xref will auto-renumber.

  [363:3+] If part 2 didn't pass, we need to do the [363:3+]
  edit from it anyway for part 4.

  [310:8-17] Move this (13.8.7.21) into the new 13.8.2.x
  in alphabetic order.

  [319:6-321:4] Move these (13.8.7.41-43) into the new 13.8.2.x
  in alphabetic order.

  [486:28] "intrinsic" -> "module"

IV. Other trivial fixups to the new functions

  I recommend the following minor editorial fixups to the
  descriptions of the IS_IOSTAT_END, IS_IOSTAT_EOR, and NEW_LINE
  functions, whether they move into the module or not.

  [300:10-11] "condition" -> "value" (twice)

  {If part 2 passes, the above edit is moot.  If part 2 does
  not pass, these lines should be made correct.  These functions
  do not, in fact, test for an end-of-file or end-of-record
  contition.  They test an integer value, which might or might
  not have come from an IOSTAT= specifier.  You could get a true
  result from these functions without any I/O ever having been
  done.}

  [327:3,10] "the argument" -> "a"   {Wording simplification.}

  [327:8,15] Change both xrefs to 9.10.4, which is the section on
  IOSTAT=.

  {Sections 9.10.2 and 9.10.3 on END= and ERR= are only
  peripherally related, and indeed actually in turn reference
  9.10.4 for the appropriate material.}

  [327:7-8,14-15] "that would be assigned to" -> "for", and
  "to indicate" -> "that would indicate"  (twice)

  {To me, the wording of the result value clauses almost make it
  sound like the programmer could cause a condition to be signaled
  by setting the variable to these values.}

  [341:24] "The" -> "Otherwise, the"

  {As is, case 3 is interp bait.  Does it imply "or", "and", or
  "otherwise"?  It makes a difference.  Let's say now instead of
  in the interp answer.}

  [341:25] "one" -> "such a character"

  {One what?  File connected for formatted stream output?}

  [235:Note 10.17] Replace note body with

    "If the module function NEW_LINE returns a blank character
     for a particular character kind, then the processor does not
     support using a character of that kind to cause record
     splitting in a formatted stream file."

  {If we want to have Note 10.17 at all, it would be good for it
  to make sense.  I don't know what field it is talking about
  splitting; I think it means record splitting.  And I'm not sure
  whether the statement otherwise is a tautology or a
  contradiction.  In one sense, if the processor actually
  supports the newline character as something that could be
  written as part of the data in a record, that would be the case
  where the newline character could *NOT* be used to split
  records, making the statement a contradiction.  In another
  sense, it is a tautology that you aren't allowed to do
  something (write the character), then you aren't going to be
  able to split records by doing it.  Let's just say what we
  mean; it isn't very complicated - either that or is is so
  complicated that I don't yet understand it.}

  [127:41+] Add list item  (Adjust xref as appropriate.)

    (4a) the inquiry function NEW_LINE (13.8.2.2.3),


  {I'd think people likely to want to use NEW_LINE in
  initialization expressions.  I see no reason to prohibit this.}

  [235:3] After NEW_LINE add " (13.8.2.2.3)".

  {An xref here seems like a good idea.  Adjust as appropriate.}
