Title: Add an ASSERT executable statement and 3 helper functions

Submitted by: J3

Status: For Consideration

References:

Basic Functionality: Add an executable statement of the form

ASSERT (alexp, [string],[level])

where alexp is either a simple-logical-expression or a
non-simple-logical-expression.

The value of alexp shall be TRUE

If string is absent it is as if it were present with
the value    who_am_i(some_argument)//"alexp".

If level is absent, it is if it were present with the
value 1

Execution of an assert statement has no effect.

Add 3 helper functions:

WHO_AM_I (logical-flag)
if logical-flag has one value (or is absent) the result is
a string with the name of the subprogram in it.  If logical-
flag has the other value, the result is "module:subprogram"

USUALLY(alexp)
The result of USUALLY is TRUE

RARELY(alexp)
The result of RARELY is TRUE

There are no restrictions on alexp for either function.

Rationale: It allows the user to explicitly state things that must
be true in a subprogram in a way that can be checked or
bypassed at execution time.  It allows the user to give
explicit hints to the optimizer in both a portable and
checkable way.

By splitting the alexp into simple and non-simple, where
simple for example has no .AND., etc. operators, only
simple inquiry functions, only simple integer operations,
etc, vendors would be strongly encouraged to parse the
simple expressions and use them in their optimization
decisions.  They could also parse the non-simple ones.
But, the intent is to make the simple ones a portable
way to say simple things about a routine so that almost
all optimizers will be pressured to do the right thing.
This, obviously, requires input from vendors.

The RARELY and USUALLY functions in an ASSERT would
be hints for optimization as opposed to flat out truths.
Thus, for example,
ASSERT (MOD(N,4) == 0)
    DO I = 1,N
would allow a processor to unroll the loop by 4 and NOT
generate checking code.  Whereas,
ASSERT(USUALLY(MOD(N,4)==0))
would tell a processor that unrolling by 4 is a darn
good idea, but that checking code is needed.

ASSERTs would most likely occur at the start or end
of a subprogram for "programming by contract" or
just before a DO loop as an optimization hint.

Estimated Impact: It only adds one more executable statement that follows
the normal rules of executable statements, it can be
a branch target, can't be mixed with the declaratives,
etc.

Execution of an ASSERT has no effect, hence it's
reletivily easy for a naive code generator to process.

A more reasonable implementation would be something like
IF (level < some_command_line_or_environment_value .and.
 .not. alexp)  STOP string
This allows the user to get run-time checking during
debugging and allows for fast execution once a program
is completely debugged.

Detailed Specification: see above.

If this idea really flies, we could think about allowing
simple asserts to be part of the declarations and hence
part of the interface information and hence take part
in generic resolution.  This sounds like a darn good idea
for a subsequent revision of the standard.
