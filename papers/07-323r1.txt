Discussion

Yes, 13.1 should have a better definition of a collective subroutine.
An edit is supplied and a corresponding edit for the definition in
2.1.22.

We need to keep the rule that the same statement is invoked on all
images of the team since this is not the case for SYNC TEAM.

Yes, we should have all the rules for implicit team synchronization in
8.5.3, so we supply an edit for that section and reference it from
13.1. The new words cover OPEN and CLOSE, too. An edit adds a reference
to 8.5.3 for OPEN. CLOSE already has such a reference.



Edits to 07-007r3



[12:6] In 2.1.22 collective subroutine, replace the definition by

     "intrinsic subroutine that is invoked on a team of images to
     perform a calculation for data on those images and assign the
     value of the result on all of them."

[201:9-11]. In 8.5.3 SYNC TEAM statement, para. 2, replace the final
     sentence by

     "If the statement contains an <image-team>, it specifies the team
     and shall satisfy the conditions required of an <image-team> in a
     SYNC TEAM statement; otherwise, the team is the connect team for
     the unit in a CLOSE statement or the set of all images for a CALL
     to a collective subroutine."

[222:8] In 9.5.6.19 TEAM= specified in the OPEN statement, at the end of
     para. 2, after "synchronization" add "(8.5.3)".

[337:15-17] In 13.1 Classes of intrinsic procedure, replace the first
     three sentences of para. 4 by 

     "A collective subroutine is one that is invoked on a team of
     images to perform a calculation for data on those images and
     assign the value of the result on all of them."

[337:18] In 13.1 Classes of intrinsic procedure, in the final sentence
      of para. 4, after "synchronization" add "(8.5.3)".
