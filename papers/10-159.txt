QUESTION:

Consider the program:

      Module m
        Type t1
          Real c
        Contains
          Final :: f10,f11
        End Type
        Type,Extends(t0) :: t2
          Real d
        Contains
          Final :: f20,f21
        End Type
      Contains
        Subroutine f10(x)
          Type(t),Intent(InOut) :: x
          Print *,'f10 called'
        End Subroutine
        Subroutine f11(x)
          Type(t),Intent(InOut) :: x(:)
          Print *,'f11 called'
        End Subroutine
        Subroutine f20(x)
          Type(t),Intent(InOut) :: x
          Print *,'f20 called'
        End Subroutine
        Subroutine f21(x)
          Type(t),Intent(InOut) :: x(:)
          Print *,'f21 called'
        End Subroutine
      End Module
      Program q
        Use m
        Type(t1),Parameter :: p1 = t1(1.5)
        Type(t2),Parameter :: p2 = t2(2.5,-3.5)
        Type(t1),Parameter :: ap1 = [ p1 ]
        Type(t2),Parameter :: ap2 = [ p2 ]
        Call sub1(p1)
        Call sub1(t1(1.5))      ! (*)
        Call sub2(p2)
        Call sub2(t2(2.5,-3.5)) ! (*)
        Call sub1a(ap1)
        Call sub1a([p1])        ! (*)
        Call sub2a(ap2)
        Call sub2a([p2])        ! (*)
      End Program

The topic is how many times each final procedure is called on return
from each subroutine?

Clearly, the final procedures are not called on return from the calls
not marked with an asterisk.

For the ones marked with an asterisk, the situation is less clear.
The standard says that a structure constructor or array constructor
is finalized
  "[if] an executable construct references [it]"
(4.5.6.3p5).
However, the term "reference" is not defined for these entities; the
closest would seem to be
  "appearance of a data object designator in a context requiring
   its value at that point during execution"
which would appear on the face of it to mean that these entities are
finalized since the constructor appears in a context requiring its
value.

Possible interpretations might be
(a) Yes, the entities are required to be finalized (so the relevant
    final procedure is executed).
(b) The text in 4.5.6.3p5 was not intended to be applied to
    constants (the standard is defective).
(c) The processor can optionally evaluate an alternative expression
    with the same value, viz an named constant, so it is processor
    dependent whether the finalizer is called.

Option (a) seems inconsistent with named constants otherwise being
equivalent to their constant expression.

Option (c) argument could be equally applied to nonconstant
constructors, so this would make all finalization of constructed
values optional.  That would seem inconsistent with the purpose
of finalization.

Which is the correct approach?

ANSWER:

The quoted text was not meant to be applied to constants.
An edit is supplied.

EDITS:

{to 10-007}

[76:24] In 4.5.6.3 When finalization occurs, paragraph 6,
  Before ", the entity created" insert
    ", and the constructor is not a constant expression (7.1.12)".
{Note avoiding the BNF syntax term as that would be incorrect.}
