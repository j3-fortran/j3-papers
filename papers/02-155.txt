Subject: BOZ: Issue 351

These edits attempt to resolve unresolved issue 351, on page 330
of 02-007.

The approach is to describe the value returned by REAL type
conversion intrinsic in terms of the value a variable
with the appropriate type and type parameters would have if its
value was the bit pattern specified by the BOZ constant.

Edits:

[330:3-6] replace these lines with
    "<Case (iii):>  If A is a <boz-literal-constant>, the result
		    is of type REAL.  If KIND is present, the result
		    has the kind type parameter specified by the
		    value of KIND.  If KIND is not present, the
		    result has the processor-dependent kind type
		    parameter of the default real type.  The value
		    of the result is equal to the value that a 
		    variable of the same type and kind type parameters
		    as the result would have if its value was the bit
		    pattern specified by the <boz-literal-constant>."
