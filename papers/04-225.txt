Title: Enhancements to COMPLEX data type

Submitted by: J3

Status: For Consideration

References: FCD, Sections 2, 4, and 13

Basic Functionality: 
Add various features to the use of COMPLEX data type and
arguments to make it more convenient and more consistent.

Rationale: 
Various rules concerning COMPLEX are archaic and poorly
integrated into the modern language due to backward 
compatibility issues.  This permits writing code in 
a manner more consistent with the rest of the language
and clearer.

Estimated Impact: 
This has no effect on existing compliant codes.  The
necessary implementation problems are mostly identical
to those of derived types.

Detailed Specification:  
 This is a brief specification:

1.
Designators for COMPLEX variables and named constants are
allowed to use the % component selection character and the 
names R and I (for Real and Imaginary parts respectively).
For example, if Z is a complex variable, the following 
assignment will change the imaginary part of Z without
referencing the real part of Z:

   Z%I = 1.0

Note that this isn't possible with the present rules.

2.
Add an intrinsic function with syntax consistent with 
constructors of derived type data in section 4.5.9.

Since COMPLEX is intrinsic, we can permit the syntactic 
sugar of allowing the KIND specification to be omitted.
The KIND of the result in that case follows the usual 
KIND promotion rules (the KIND of the result is the same
and the most precise KIND of the operands).  With the KIND
omitted, both operand expressions must be REAL.

Since the semantics is more consistent with expectations
than the CMPLX intrinsic, this form is to be preferred for
most uses.

3. (a little more syntactic sugar)
Add a new intrinsic operator (.i.) whose meaning is "i times"
its argument.  Hence, X + .i.Y will read as "X plus i times Y".
If both X and Y are real, this is the same as COMPLEX(X,Y).
This form should be permitted in the constriction of constants
(and in §4.1.2 and §4.4.3)
