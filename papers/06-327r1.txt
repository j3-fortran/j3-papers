Discussion of issue 77 (page 495)

Issue 77 predicts various forms of conflict and disaster that will
result from the sentence "Two nonpointer nonallocatable scalar objects
for which the intrinsic function BIT_SIZE returns the same value
occupy the same amount of storage." [495:10-11].  The motivation for
this sentence is to ensure that passing an actual argument of type
integer to a dummy argument that is of type bits and of the same
bit_size actually works.  The current sentence imposes two classes of
restrictions: (1) Storage sizes for a limited number of bits kinds are
constrained to be the same as those for the corresponding integers and
(2) bits or integer objects of the same type but in different contexts
have the same storage size.

Two options are proposed below.  Option 2 was selected by J3.

Option 1: Accept the constraints implicit in the current text.  No
edits are required for this option.

Option 2: Remove the sentence at the expense of requiring explicit
interfaces in a new situation.  If there is no storage correspondence
requirement between a non-bits actual argument and a bits dummy
argument then an explicit interface would be required for that case so
the compiler could reformat the actual argument as needed as part of
argument association.

Note that this option has the side effect of allowing (but certainly
not requiring) a compiler to pack consecutive bits components in a
structure.  For example, scalar objects of a type defined as

 type flags
    bits(13) :: a
    bits(19) :: b
 end type flags

might occupy a single 32-bit word of memory. If a compiler used this
design (perhaps under the control of a compiler switch), and assuming
that a simple scalar of type bits(19) is actually stored in a 32-bit
memory cell, then as assignment of the form

type(flags) :: struct(100)
bits(19)    :: bcomp(100)

bcomp(:) = struct(:)%b

would involve hidden unpacking of the structure to extract the correct
19-bit field.  A similar restructuring would be required if
struct(:)%b were an actual argument corresponding to a dummy argument
bcomp.  Effectively a copy-in/copy-out would be coded.  In the case
where the actual and dummy arguments are both of type bits the
compiler would automatically know to create this code.  However, if
the actual argument is not of type bits and some restructuring is
needed to affect association with a dummy argument of type bits, the
compiler would not be aware of this in the calling routine unless an
explicit interface were visible.

The second option requires edits.

Edits to J3/06-007r1 for Option 2

[495:10:11] Remove the sentence "Two nonpointer ... amount of storage."

[298:1] At the end of item (1)(c) of the list of cases requiring
an explicit interface , add "or"

[298:1+] Add a new item (1)(d): "with an argument that is not of
type bits corresponding to a dummy argument of type bits,"
