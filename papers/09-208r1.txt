Subject: Suggested new feature for F2008

1. Introduction

This is trivial, but is for WG5 to decide whether it is too late.

The only difference between this and 09-208 is the addition of the
"Example" section.


2. Description

Erik Kruyt made the following suggestion:

  "R448. This is the only instance of PROCEDURE where no list is allowed. I
   suggest to change binding-name into binding-name-list, and binding-name
   [=> procedure-name] in binding-spec-list. Binding-spec is binding-name
   [=> procedure-name]. The accompanying example in the 2003 standard
   included such a list, which is now corrected to be consistent with the
   rule. Is this feasible."

This is obviously feasible and obviously simple.
The example in F2003 shows we originally intended it this way anyway.
Therefore I have Specs, Syntax, and Edits.


3. Example

Consider the Fortran 2003 type definition:

  TYPE frac
    INTEGER num,denom
  CONTAINS
    PRIVATE
    PROCEDURE :: frac_plus_frac => frac_plus
    PROCEDURE :: frac_plus_i
    PROCEDURE :: frac_plus_r
    PROCEDURE,PASS(b) :: i_plus_frac
    PROCEDURE,PASS(b) :: r_plus_frac
    GENERIC,PUBLIC :: OPERATOR(+) => frac_plus_frac, frac_plus_i, &
                      frac_plus_r, i_plus_frac, r_plus_frac
  END TYPE

Clearly the GENERIC statement is a lot more convenient to use than the
PROCEDURE statement.  The extension would allow the above type to be
written as

  TYPE frac
    INTEGER num,denom
  CONTAINS
    PRIVATE
    PROCEDURE :: frac_plus_frac => frac_plus, frac_plus_i, frac_plus_r
    PROCEDURE,PASS(b) :: i_plus_frac, r_plus_frac
    GENERIC,PUBLIC :: OPERATOR(+) => frac_plus_frac, frac_plus_i, &
                      frac_plus_r, i_plus_frac, r_plus_frac
  END TYPE

The example in F2003 at [447:17-29] was similar to this; that example was
changed in the F2008 draft (because it was not valid syntax); the Edits
below reinstate the F2003 example as it used to be.


4. Specification

That the syntax for specifying a type-bound procedure be extended to allow
specifying more than one type-bound procedure in a single statement.  This
is consistent with the way of declaring procedure pointer components (also
known as object-bound procedures), the procedure declaration statement and
the (MODULE) PROCEDURE statement.


5. Syntax

The name for the new syntax term is stylistically similar to the component
declaration statement (component-decl and proc-decl), and type declaration
statement (entity-decl).

  PROCEDURE [ [ , <binding-attr-list> ] :: ] <type-bound-proc-decl-list>
and
  PROCEDURE ( <interface-name> ) [ , <binding-attr-list> ] ::
      <binding-name-list>

where <type-bound-proc-decl> is
  <binding-name> [ => <procedure-name> ]


6. Edits to N1776

[73:12,14,14+] 4.5.5 R448
  Replace "<binding-name> [ => <procedure-name> ]"
  with    "<type-bound-proc-decl-list>";
  replace ":: <binding-name>"
  with    ":: <binding-name-list>";
  add new rule
    "R448a <type-bound-proc-decl> <<is>>
           <binding-name> [ => <procedure-name> ]".
{The new syntax.}

[73:15,18] 4.5.5 C464, 4.5.5p1
  After "appears" insert "in a <type-bound-proc-decl>", twice.
{Improve clarity.}

[74:19] 4.5.5p2, first sentence.
  "declares a ... procedure." -> "declares one or more ... procedures."

[472:40-42] C.1.3p4
  Replace the three type-bound procedure statements with one
    "PROCEDURE,PRIVATE :: rat_asgn_i, rat_plus_i, rat_plus_rat".
{Reinstate the example of what we originally intended to do.}
