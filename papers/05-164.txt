TITLE: Commas in complex namelist output
KEYWORDS: Namelist, complex formatting, comma, semicolon
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

The 7th paragraph in 10.9.2 for list directed output says:

"Complex constants are enclosed in parentheses with a
separator between the real and imaginary parts, each
produced as defined above for real constants. The separator
is a comma if the decimal edit mode is POINT; it is a
semicolon if the decimal edit mode is COMMA."

There are similar words in most other places where complex
formatting is described.

The second paragraph of 10.10.1.3 Namelist group object list
items says:

"When the next effective item is of type complex, the input
form of the input value consists of a left parenthesis
followed by an ordered pair of numeric input fields
separated by a comma and followed by a right parenthesis. "

Other places correctly describe namelist complex output as
having a separator, either a comma or a semicolon, depending
on the decimal edit mode.

Should the namelist version be reworded to say "comma or
semicolon"?


ANSWER:

Yes.  Edits are supplied to correct this oversight.
In addition, a simlar issue exists for list directed input of
undelimited character values and namelist output of character
values.

EDITS:

All edits refer to 04-007.

[240:13] Replace "comma" with "comma, or semicolon if the decimal
         edit mode is decimal,"

[244:29] Replace "comma" with "separator".
[244:30] Before "The first", add the following sentence:
           The separator is a comma if the decimal edit mode is POINT;
           it is a semicolon if the decimal edit mode is COMMA.
[244:32] Replace "comma" with "separator".
[244:33] Replace "comma" with "separator".

[245:4] after "comma," insert " semicolon,"
