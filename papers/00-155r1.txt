Subject:	ALLOCATE(MOULD=)

1. Introduction

A recent WG5 resolution exhorts us to add an ALLOCATE option that creates an
object whose dynamic type is the same as the dynamic type of another variable
(i.e. not the declared type, and not a type that could be explicitly specified
in the ALLOCATE statement).  This is not a mandatory feature, but does come
highly recommended by WG5 if we can do it as an MTE.

It is not completely mandatory because there are two ways of programming the
functionality (viz, copying a polymorphic data structure) with varying degrees
of inconvenience:
(1) Do a SELECT TYPE on the variable one wishes to copy the type information
    from, and do the appropriately explicitly typed allocation within each
    TYPE IS block.  This is fragile and inconvenient.
(2) Provide a type-bound procedure which returns a copy of its object.  A
    new procedure needs to be written for each type to be handled, and this
    cannot be retrofitted onto an existing class structure.

However, in my experience the ALLOCATE(MOULD=) feature as described above only
solves 20% of the problem (of copying a polymorphic data structure); 80% of the
time one wishes to copy the value as well as the type information.  Just
copying the type information would not obviate the need for a SELECT TYPE in
these cases.

Most (not all) other O.O. languages contain a copying facility for polymorphic
entities, variously spelled "copy" or "clone".  Sometimes it is an intrinsic
function (e.g. Simula-67 "COPY(x)"), sometimes it is an intrinsicly
provided type-bound procedure (e.g. Java "x%clone()").  Since in Fortran
memory allocation is provided by an ALLOCATE statement, provision of this
facility would best fit as an option within the ALLOCATE statement.

2. Specifications

There shall be a "CLONE" facility which makes a copy of a polymorphic object
preserving the dynamic type information and the value.  This shall be provided
via an option on the ALLOCATE statement.

Preserving the value means assigning the value from the object being cloned to
the new object via (nonpolymorphic) intrinsic assignment (there is no
polymorphic intrinsic assignment).  Including the special treatment of pointer
components and allocatable components.

3. Syntax

Given a polymorphic pointer or allocatable variable X, and a polymorphic
variable (whether pointer, allocatable, or plain dummy) Y,
  ALLOCATE(X,CLONE=Y)
shall allocate X to have the same dynamic type as Y, with the value of Y
assigned to X as if by intrinsic assignment.

Thus, pointer components of X are associated with the same targets as the
pointer components of Y.  Allocatable components of X have the same allocation
status as allocatable components of Y, and if allocated, the same values.
Nonpointer nonallocatable components of X are assigned the same values as the
corresponding components of Y.  All value copying done as if by intrinsic
assignment.

Straw Vote: Prefer (1) CLONE= spelling
                   (2) COPY= spelling
		   (3) SOURCE= spelling
		   (4) some other syntax
                   (5) Undecided.

4. Implementation Requirements

Extensible types could have an additional entry in the "type signature"
indicating what, if any, special treatment is required for the assignment.

5. Edits

[102:15+] Insert "<<or>> CLONE= <clone-variable>"

[102:23+] Insert "R631a <clone-variable> <<is>> <variable>"

[102:41+] Insert constraints
"Constraint: If CLONE= is specified, <type-spec> shall not be specified,
             <allocation-list> shall contain only one <allocation>, and
	     <allocate-object> shall be type-compatible with
	     <clone-variable>.
 Constraint: <clone-variable> shall be polymorphic and have the same rank and
             kind type parameters as <allocate-object>.
 Constraint: The corresponding kind type parameters of <allocate-object> and
             <clone-variable> shall have the same values."

[103:9] After ";" insert
        "if a <clone-variable> is specified, it allocates an object whose
         dynamic type and type parameters are the same as those of
         <clone-variable>;"

[103:28+] Insert new paragraph
"If the CLONE= is present, <clone-variable> shall have the same shape as
 <allocate-object>.  If the allocation is successful, <clone-variable> is
 then assigned to <allocate-object> as if by an intrinsic assignment for
 objects whose declared type is the dynamic type of <clone-variable>."
