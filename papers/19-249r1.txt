Subject: Syntax for True Enumeration types
Date: 2019-October-17
Reference: 19-231r2, 19-232

1. Syntax to define an enumeration type
=======================================

1.1 General idea

  <begin type definition>
    [ PRIVATE ]
    <list enumerators>
  <end type definition>

1.2 Begin and end type definition

Based on ENUM in subclause 7.6

  ENUM [[, INITIAL ( <enumerator-name ),  <access-spec> ] ::] <type-name>
    ...
  END ENUM [ <type-name> ]

1.3 Declare enumerators

A statement to specify enumerator names

  ENUMERATOR [ [, <access-spec> ] :: ] <enumerator-name-list>

{Simply listing the names without a keyword does not work. In fixed
form, or if the optional space in END TYPE is omitted, the ENDTYPE
statement looks like just another enumerator. And then the next statement
causes a syntax error because it doesn't look like an enumerator.}

1.4 Declare default initial value

On the statement that introduces the type definition

  ENUM [, INITIAL ( <enumerator-name> ), <access-spec> ] :: <type-name>

2. Syntax to declare an object of enumeration type
==================================================

  TYPE ( <type-name> ) [[ , <attr-list> ] :: ] <entity-decl> [ = &
    & <initialization> ]

  Constraint: <initialization> shall be of type <type-name>.

3. Syntax to reference an enumerator
====================================

Straw vote on 19-231 was that enumerators are class (2) names.

Therefore, the type name must always appear.

Vauguely reminiscent of component selection

  <type-name> % <enumerator-name>

{We do not ever use "<type-name> %" for anything.}

4. FIRST, LAST inquiry
======================

Vaguely reminiscent of type parameter inquiry

  <enumeration-type-object> % FIRST
  <enumeration-type-object> % LAST

5. NEXT, PREV as type-bound functions
===========================================

NEXT and PREV are considered to be type-bound functions that are
defined by the type definition, without bindings being declared.  There
is no syntax provided to declare procedure bindings.

  <enumeration-type-object> % NEXT ( [ [ STAT= ] <stat-variable> ] )
  <enumeration-type-object> % PREV ( [ [ STAT= ] <stat-variable> ] )

6. Use case for private enumerators
===================================

No code example here, just an explanation.

A code that really is a coroutine, but can't actually be a coroutine
because Fortran doesn't provide coroutines, uses "reverse communication." 
I.e., whenever it needs the client to do some work, it returns to the
client.

In a fake coroutine, realized using reverse communication, the internal
state is usually kept in a dummy argument of derived type.

To tell the client what to do, one of the components of the internal state
encodes "What should the client to do?"  Internally, this is interpreted
as "What do I do next?"  An object of enumeration type is perfect for
this.

The code is organized as a "state machine."  These are typically realized
as a DO construct with a SELECT CASE construct inside.  Before a case
completes execution, it assigns a value to "What should the client do,"
which is, as remarked above, internally interpreted as "What do I do
next?"

Usually, it returns to the client, who performs the requested action and
calls again, whereupon the DO construct restarts, and the SELECT CASE
construct takes the code to the next step of the process.

The client would be expected to handle requests like "evaluate the
function," "evaluate the Jacobian,", "factor the Jacobian," "Compute the
gradient"..., but would have no idea what "compute Aitken acceleration"
or "compute Levenberg-Marquardt parameter" or "compute the angle between
the gradient and the Newton move" would mean.

If there are internal state transitions that are difficult to represent
using the usual control constructs, they are represented by different
values of the "What should the client do" component of the internal state,
which are purely "what do I do next" values because the client never sees
them.  These values have no meaning to the client, and there is no reason
to expose their names to the client.  It would just be confusing. In these
cases, instead of RETURN, the code does CYCLE (or simply finishes the
SELECT CASE construct).

In the old days, the enumeration type would be faked with integer named
constants. The ones that have no meaning to the client would be PRIVATE.
When the code uses an enumeration type instead, it would be desirable that
it be possible to declare that enumerators that have the same purpose
as the private named constants would have, are private.
