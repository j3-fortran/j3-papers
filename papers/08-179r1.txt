Introduction

There are problems in 12.5.5.3.

An interface body specifies the EXTERNAL attribute, so we don't need to
say "interface body or".

Procedure pointers are overlooked.

A statement function is not a syntax entity; we need to say "statement
function statement".  

Bare "intrinsic" isn't sufficiently descriptive; we need to say
"intrinsic procedure".

[300: 12.5.5.3] --------------------------------------------------------

Editor:

In 12.5.5.3p1 and 12.5.5.3p2 delete "interface body or" twice.

In 12.5.5.3p2, after "dummy argument of the scoping unit" insert "and
not the name of a procedure pointer".

After 12.5.5.3p2 insert a new paragraph:

"If the scoping unit contains an EXTERNAL attribute specification for
the name and the name is a procedure pointer, the reference is to its
target."

In 12.5.5.3p3 insert \obs{statement} after \obs{statement function}

In 12.5.5.3p4 insert "procedure" after "intrinsic".

In 12.5.5.3p5 insert "that is not the name of a procedure pointer"
before "accessible".

After 12.5.5.3p5 insert a new paragraph:

"If the scoping unit contains a USE statement that makes a procedure
pointer accessible by that name, the reference is to its target."
