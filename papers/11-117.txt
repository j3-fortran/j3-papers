DISCUSSION

Unresolved Technical Issue TR9 of N1838 asks for a note to be added to
explain that assumed rank is a Fortran concept and that in C code the
object will appear to have an explicit rank. It also asks for the note
to discuss the attributes of the object, but this seems unnecessary
since the attribute rules do not differ from those when the rank is
explicit.

EDIT to N1838:

2.2 Assumed-rank objects
[4:5+] At the end of the section, add

NOTE 2.1
When a C code is invoked with an assumed-rank actual argument, the
corresponding dummy argument is a pointer to a descriptor of type
CFI_cdesc_t (see 5.2.8). The rank component of the descriptor
provides the rank of the ranked object that is associated with
the actual argument in the environment of the call, perhaps
via other assumed-rank associations within the call chain.
The C code must therefore be able to handle any rank, but on
each invocation, the rank will be available to it.
