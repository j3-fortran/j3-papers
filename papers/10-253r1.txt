1. Introduction
---------------

This paper consists of an annotated version of N1820, "C
Interoperability Objectives", with references to the TR draft N1xxx
(J3/10-251), specifying where each of the Requirements and Constraints
is addressed. Reply text is enclosed in [ ].

This revision is still a DRAFT document, which needs additional work
before being converted into a WG5 document.


2 Requirements
--------------

2.1 General
-----------

Requirement 1:

     A mechanism should be provided to enable a C programmer to
     conveniently obtain the address of a particular element within an
     assumed-rank, assumed-shape, allocatable, or pointer array.

[Provided by the CFI_address function (5.2.6.4).]

Requirement 2:

     If it is reasonably feasible, a mechanism should be provided for
     C function to specify by explicit declaration the type or rank
     (both preferred) of an assumed-shape, allocatable, or pointer
     object. The objective is to provide a facility for type and rank
     safety.

[Provided by the CFI_create_cdesc (5.2.6.2), CFI_initialize (5.2.6.3),
CFI_associate (5.2.6.5) functions, and the CFI_CDESC_T Macro (5.2.5)
for declarations.]

Constraint 1:

     It is generally the case that assumed-shape, allocatable, and
     pointer objects are represented in implementations as a
     descriptor. It is reasonable to assume the same will be true of
     assumed-rank objects. The descriptor used within Fortran to
     describe an object should not be visible to the C function that
     has access to the corresponding object in a C function.

[The TR specifies a C descriptor in 5.2.2. References to a Fortran
descriptor that existed in earlier drafts are no longer included.]


2.2 Assumed-type
----------------

Requirement 3:
	
    A dummy argument declared assumed-type should be compatible with
    an actual argument of an arbitrary interoperable type, or of
    assumed-type. It is not required that the interface for the
    procedure specify bind(c). A mechanism to inquire the type of an
    assumed-type dummy argument in a C function is not required.

[The assumed-type feature is specified in 2.1, with the argument
association rules in 3.3.]

Constraint 2:

    Assumed-type dummy arguments may appear as actual arguments. Apart
    from that, such dummy arguments are usable only in a procedure
    which can access them with the type of the ultimate argument that
    is not assumed-type.  There is no intent to provide such a
    mechanism for this use in Fortran.  An explicit interface is
    required for a procedure with an assumed-type dummy argument.

[Specified in 2.1, 3.2, and 3.3.]

2.3 Assumed-rank
----------------

Requirement 4:

    A dummy argument declared assumed-rank should be compatible with
    an actual argument of an arbitrary rank, or of assumed-rank. It is
    not required that the interface for the procedure specify bind(c).

[Specified in 3.3]

Requirement 5:

    A mechanism to inquire the rank of an assumed-rank object shall be
    provided.

[For Fortran, the RANK intrinsic is specified in 4.2. For C, the rank
member of the C descriptor (5.2.2) specifies the rank.]

Requirement 6:

    A mechanism to inquire the bounds and strides in each dimension of
    an assumed-rank array shall be provided to a C function. An
    assumed-rank array is not required to be contiguous.

[The C function CFI_cdesc_to_bounds (5.2.6.9) produces the bounds and
strides information.]

Constraint 3:

    Assumed-rank dummy arguments may appear as actual arguments. Apart
    from that, such arguments are usable if passed to a procedure
    which can access them with the correct rank. There is no intent to
    provide such a mechanism for this use in Fortran.  The interface
    of a procedure called with an actual argument that is assumed-rank
    shall be explicit. An explicit interface is required for a
    procedure with an assumed-rank dummy argument.

[Specified in 2.2, 3.2, and 3.3.]

2.4 Optional Arguments
----------------------

Requirement 7:

    Interoperable interfaces should allow OPTIONAL dummy arguments.

[Specified in 2.3.]

Constraint 4:

    Dummy arguments with both the OPTIONAL and VALUE attributes are
    not required to be interoperable.

[Specified in 2.3.]


2.5 Assumed-shape Arrays
------------------------

Requirement 8:

    (a) An interface with bind(c) may include assumed-shape dummy
    arguments. The called procedure should be able to access the
    shape, strides, and elements of the dummy argument.

[Interoperability of interfaces is specified in 5.2.8. Access
mechanisms are specified in 5.2.2 and 5.2.6.]

    (b) A C function should have a mechanism to create an array that
    it can use as an actual argument corresponding to an assumed-shape
    dummy of a Fortran procedure.  The same mechanism should allow an
    existing block of memory in the C function, including an array
    passed into the C function, or memory accessed as a global object,
    to be passed to an assumed-shape dummy in Fortran.

[Provided by the CFI_create_cdesc (5.2.6.2), CFI_initialize (5.2.6.3),
CFI_associate (5.2.6.5) functions.]

    c) In the scope of a C function, the lower bounds of an
    assumed-shape dummy argument are assumed to be zero. In a Fortran
    procedure, the lower bounds of an assumed-shape dummy are assumed
    from its declaration.

[******* This had been tagged as "OK", but I'm not seeing the words
         at the moment.*******]

Constraint 5:

    The memory that is associated with a Fortran assumed-shape dummy
    argument should be memory that is accessible in Fortran using
    normal variable definitions or references.

[Provided by the general interoperability specified in 5.2.8.]

    Array strides of zero and overlapping elements are not supported.

[******* I do not see specific prohibitions for this. ******]


2.6 Allocatable Objects
-----------------------

Requirements 9:

    a) The requirements and constraints that apply to assumed-shape
       arrays also apply to ALLOCATABLE ones (including converting
       them to assumed-shape), excluding the interpretation of lower
       bounds of an assumed-shape array.

[******* This had been tagged as "OK", but I don't see it spelled out.
         With the new functions provided in 10-224r2, it is
	 straightforward to create a new assumed-shape descriptor
	 for the object. ********]

    b) A mechanism should be provided for a C function to allocate and
       deallocate ALLOCATABLE objects passed from Fortran.  The
       mechanism should provide a means for the C function to specify
       the bounds for array being allocated.

[Provided by the CFI_allocate (5.2.6.6) and CFI_deallocate (5.2.6.7)
functions.]

    c) A mechanism should be provided for a C function to create an
       ALLOCATABLE object that can be passed as an actual argument to
       Fortran corresponding to an ALLOCATABLE dummy argument.  Such
       an ALLOCATABLE object should be capable of allocation and
       deallocation using Fortran ALLOCATE and DEALLOCATE statements.

[Provided by the CFI_create_cdesc (5.2.6.2), CFI_initialize (5.2.6.3)
functions.]

    d) INTENT(OUT) ALLOCATABLE dummy arguments are permitted in a
       BIND(C) routine.  It is the responsibility of the processor to
       deallocate the actual argument in any cross-language call.  It
       is not required for the processor to handle this in C-to-C
       calls.

[Specified in 3.3 Argument association, paragraph 4.]

2.6 Pointer Arrays
------------------


Requirements 10:

    a) all of the requirements and constraints that apply to
       ALLOCATABLE arrays, except as noted in the following
       requirement, also apply to POINTER ones.

[Implied by 5.2.6.2 and 5.2.6.3.]

    b) C should be able to allocate memory for POINTER arrays,
       starting from C pointers, and pass them to Fortran as such.

[Provided by the CFI_associate (5.2.6.5) function, with restrictions
specified in 5.2.7.]

Constraint 6:

    Neither Fortran nor C may deallocate pointers associated with a
    target by the other.

[Subsequent discussion leads to this being an already solved issue,
and the requirement needs to be reworded to refer to allocation rather
than association. N1820 might need amendment.]


3 Goals
-------

These are not part of the requirements, but might affect the
implementation model.

   a) Execution efficiency is important, which definitely means that
      data remapping should not be needed, but it is unclear beyond
      that.

[It appears that data remapping is avoided, though descriptor
reformatting is required which has some performance impact.]

   b) Minimize the work required to modify the Fortran compiler.

[Arguably, we failed at this, but it was not a requirement.]


4 Features not included
-----------------------

In the discussion of the requirements for the TR, additional
requirements were suggested, but failed to achieve sufficient
consensus to be included in the TR. These might be considered as part
of a future standard. They are:


   a) Make assumed-length character an interoperable type.

[This was added at the request of the MPI Fortran Forum.]

   b) Expand the uses of assumed-rank objects within Fortran.

[Not addressed.]
