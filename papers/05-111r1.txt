Subject: Signbit of NaN

Here is a draft response for F03/0032, with thanks to Malcolm Cohen
for his help.

NUMBER:  F03/0032
TITLE:  Sign bit of IEEE NaN
KEYWORDS: IEEE-754, NaN, sign bit, negative
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation 
STATUS: For consideration

QUESTION:

Do IEEE-754 NaNs have a sign bit?  Can they be negative?  Does a
sign bit imply a value can be either positive or negative?

Fortran 2003 in 14.10.2 (IEEE_COPY_SIGN) says that NaNs have a
sign bit.  But, 14.10.10 (IEEE_IS_NEGATIVE) says NaNs are not
negative.  This appears to be a contradiction between two parts
of Fortran 2003.

ANSWER:

The representation of a NaN has a sign bit, and this is what is 
referred to in 14.10.2.  However, that bit is not interpreted as
a sign (see IEEE standard, 6.3 "This standard does not interpret the
sign of a NaN").  Thus 14.10.10 correctly says that a NaN is never
negative.

EDITS:  None.
