In 6.3 Constants, we say "redefinition of a constant in never
permitted".  I suspect we mean that redefinition of a named constant
is never permitted, since those are the only constants that have a
definition mechanism.

In 6.7.1.3 Allocation of allocatable variables, there are two
instances where we say that the ALLOCATED function "returns" a
value. Elsewhere in the standard we tend to say that functions have a
certain "result", rather than using the "returns" terminology.

[122:5] In 6.3 Constants, in the last sentence, change "redefinition
of a constant" to "redefinition of a named constant".

[133:7-8] In 6.7.1.3 Allocation of allocatable variables, in the first
bullet item, change the last paragraph "The intrinsic function
ALLOCATED (13.8.11) returns true for such a variable." to "The result
of the intrinsic function ALLOCATED (13.8.11) is true for such a
variable."

[133:14-15] In 6.7.1.3 Allocation of allocatable variables, in the
second bullet item, change the last paragraph "The intrinsic function
ALLOCATED (13.8.11) returns false for such a variable." to "The result
of the intrinsic function ALLOCATED (13.8.11) is false for such a
variable."
