A Public Comment for f03 requested a FIRSTLOC and a LASTLOC
pair of intrinsics to return the first or last elements evaluating
to true.

Paper 04-113 replaced that suggestion with FINDLOC, and included
a BACK= argument, similarly to the string search intrinsics.

The 167 Hate .. Love vote was 0 - 1 - 9 - 0.
This paper is a proposed "doneness" paper for FINDLOC.

Basic Functionality: Intrinsic returns location of first true encountered,
                     searching from the first or last element of an array.

Rationale:  Considered in response to a public comment, this formulation
            is modeled on the MINLOC/MAXLOC procedures.  Rather than
            propose two procedures, a BACK= is proposed modeled after
            similar argument to the character search routines index, scan,
            and verify.  The BACK= is used to distinguish forward and
            backward searches, this may result is coding convience
            or in more compact code.

Estimated Impact: The impact score was 3 on the John Reid scale at 167.

Detailed Specification: FINDLOC( <logical-array> [, DIM=s-i-e, BACK= s-l-e,
                        KIND=i-i-e])

                        Returns the indices of the first true,
                        starting with the first element of mask.
                        If BACK= is present and the s-l-e evaluates to true,
                        returns the index of the first true element
                        starting with the last element and searching
                        backwards.

                        [316:22+] (after the Note) Add:

                        "13.7.38+ FINDLOC( ARRAY, DIM [, BACK, KIND])
                                  FINDLOC( ARRAY [, BACK, KIND])

                        *Description.*  Determine the location of the first
                        or last element of a logical array having the value
                        of true.

                        *Class.* Transformational function.

                        *Arguments.*

                        ARRAY           shall be of type logical.  It shall
                                        not be a scalar.

                        DIM (optional)  shall be of type integer with a value
                                        in the range 1 <= DIM <= n, where
                                        n is the rank of ARRAY.  The
                                        corresponding actual argument shall
                                        not be an optional dummy argument.

                        BACK (optional) shall be of type logical.  It shall
                                        be a scalar.

                        KIND (optional) shall be a scalar integer
                                        initialization expression.

                        *Result Characteristics.*  Integer.  If KIND is
                        present, the kind type parameter is that specified by
                        the value of KIND; otherwise the kind type parameter
                        is that of default integer type.  If DIM is absent,
                        the result is an array of rank one and of size equal
                        to the rank of ARRAY; otherwise, the result is of rank
                        n-1 and shape (d1, d2, ..., dDIM-1, dDIM+1, ... dn),
                        where (d1, d2, ..., dn) is the shape of ARRAY.

                        *Result Value.*
                        Case (i):   The result of FINDLOC( ARRAY) or
                                    FINDLOC( ARRAY, BACK=.false.) is a rank-one
                                    array whose element values are the values
                                    of the subscripts of the first element of
                                    ARRAY, taken in array element order, having
                                    the value true.  The ith subscript lies in
                                    the range 1 to ei, where ei is the extent
                                    of the ith dimension of ARRAY.  If ARRAY
                                    has no true elements, all elements of the
                                    result are zero.

                        Case (ii):  The result of FINDLOC( ARRAY, BACK=.true.)
                                    is a rank-one array whose element values
                                    are the values of the subscripts of the
                                    first element of ARRAY, taken in reverse
                                    array element order, having the value true.
                                    The ith subscript lies in the range 1 to ei,
                                    where ei is the extent of the ith dimension
                                    of ARRAY.  If ARRAY has no true elements,
                                    all elements of the result are zero.
 
                        Case (iii): If ARRAY has rank one, FINDLOC( ARRAY,
                                    DIM=DIM) or FINDLOC( ARRAY, DIM=DIM, BACK=
                                    .false.) is a scalar whose value is equal
                                    to that of the first element of FINDLOC(
                                    ARRAY [,BACK=.false.]).  Otherwise, the
                                    value of element (s1, s2, ..., sDIM-1,
                                    sDIM+1, ..., sn) of the result is equal to

                                    FINDLOC( ARRAY( s1, s2, ..., sDIM-1, :,
                                    sDIM+1, ..., sn), DIM=1 [, BACK=.false.])

                        Case (iv):  If ARRAY has rank one, FINDLOC( ARRAY,
                                    DIM=DIM, BACK= .true.) is a scalar whose
                                    value is equal to that of the first element
                                    of FINDLOC( ARRAY, BACK=.true.).  Otherwise,
                                    the value of element (s1, s2, ..., sDIM-1,
                                    sDIM+1, ..., sn) of the result is equal to

                                    FINDLOC( ARRAY( s1, s2, ..., sDIM-1, :,
                                    sDIM+1, ..., sn), DIM=1, BACK=.true.)
                        </EDITS>

                        An example might be helpful, but this paper
                        does not contain one.

                        Since ARRAY cannot be of type character, there is no
                        need to discuss a character case (as is discussed
                        in the MINLOC/MAXLOC definitions).

                        For symmetry, it may be desirable to add
                        a BACK= to MAXLOC and MINLOC, however, this paper
                        does not propose to do so.
