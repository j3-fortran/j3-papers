Subject:  FLUSH for files

A frequent topic on Comp.Lang.Fortran is "How do I flush a file
in Fortran?"  The answer is "you can't."

Following discusions on the J3 mailing list, I'll add two more 
possibilities for discussion.  I originally proposed adding a 
FLUSH= keyword to the OPEN, INQUIRE, and WRITE statements (but 
not READ where it makes no sense).  The other two possibilities 
are adding a FLUSH statement modeled after REWIND/BACKSPACE/ENDFILE 
and adding an intrinsic subroutine.  The last two options would 
have an external-file-unit argument and some sort of statues 
return argument.  For the status return I'd like to keep it simple; 
just a scalar-default-int-variable which gets set to zero if the 
processor does a processor-dependent flush action and to a positive 
value if it doesn't.  If there is no status argument specified,
the routine should return whether or not it actually does a
FLUSH.  I'd also remove the restrictions about FLUSH for READ, etc.  
Let the status result describe what happens.

For OPEN the options would be FLUSH="NO" or FLUSH="YES", with "NO"
the default.  If "YES" is specified the processor will "flush the
buffers" (whatever that means) after every output operation.  The
set of files that is flushable is processor dependent.  The words
will need to be modeled after VOLATILE.  A processor that is flushing
must make a good faith effort to do the actual physical output as
soon as it can.  It should not be an error condition to request
flushing on a file that can't be flushed.

For INQUIRE the option would be FLUSH=scalar-default-char-variable
with the responses being either "YES" or "NO".  The processor will
return "NO" if the file was not opened with FLUSH="YES" or if the
file isn't in the set of files that can be flushed--regardless of
the OPEN specifier.

For WRITE add a FLUSH="YES" or "NO" keyword that overrides the
OPEN specification.  If a file isn't in the set than can be flushed
the keyword is ignored.  It's a compile time syntax error to
specify FLUSH for internal files or on READ statements.  I'm not
sure what to do for derived type or asynchronous write statements;
ignoring FLUSH= or making it illegal both sound reasonable.

We'd add enough words to the text description to make it clear that
the processor doesn't really have to do anything, but that it should
try to do the right thing.

One question is whether or not WRITE(ADVANCE="NO" ...) followed
by a READ isn't good enough.  I've been told that there are
different implementations of this sequence and some of them are
surprising to some users.  Also, I've been told that "advance = 'no'"
followed by a read to the same unit is what often triggers the output.
This is OK for output to a screen followed by a read from the terminal,
but sometimes people want to use advance = 'no' to write a progress
bar on the screen, and this doesn't work unless the output is
immediately flushed to the screen.  Flush lets people say what they
mean and not depend on a quirk of implementation.

Flush is also useful for debugging of a program that crashes.
Leaving the results of WRITE statements in internal buffers isn't
much help here.

If we want to do this, I think writing the actual rules and text will
be relatively simple.
