Reference: N1723, ISO/IEC Directives, part 2

To conform with the directives, I think we may need to make these changes:
   Move 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 to new clause 1 with no subclauses.
   Move 1.4 to new clause 4.
   Move 1.5 to an annex (if it is agreed that it is not normative).
   Move 1.6 to new clause 5. 
   Move 1.7 to new clause 6. 
   Move 1.8 to new clause 2. 
   Move 2.1 to new clause 3.
   Move 2.2 to new clause 7.
   Add 5 to clauses 3,4,... 

It would probably be OK to have 1.4, 1.6, 1.7, 2.2 as subclauses of
the new 4, but clauses 3,4,... would still need renumbering. 


It might be OK to
   Move 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 to new subclause 1.1 with no subclauses.
   Leave 1.4 as 1.4.
   Move 1.5 to an annex (if it is agreed that it is not normative).
   Move 1.6 to subclause 1.5. 
   Move 1.7 to subclause 1.6. 
   Move 1.8 to subclause 1.2. 
   Move 2.1 to subclause 1.3.
   Move 2.2 to clause 2.
   No changes to clauses 3,4,...
