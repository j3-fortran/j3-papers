**********************************************************************

F08/0003   Is a disassociated pointer allowed as an actual DIM argument?

  Jim Xia's Comment F08/0003:

    The edits missed the following intrinsics which have the same
    problem of optional DIM argument:
      COUNT, LBOUND, LCOBOUND, UBOUND, UCOBOUND

  Van replied to Jim:

    The edits did not miss these cases.  They were handled by a different
    strategy from the others.

    See edits for 13.7.41p3, 13.7.90p3, 13.7.91p3, 13.7.171p3, and
    13.7.172p3 in the text of the interp in 10-199 (a meeting 193 paper).

  Van further replied:

    One might think we have could handled them with signatures such as

      13.7.41 COUNT ( MASK [,KIND] ) or COUNT ( MASK, DIM [, KIND] )

    and made DIM non-optional, but that wouldn't work because both KIND
    and DIM are integers.  In CALL COUNT ( [ .TRUE. ], J ) one cannot tell
    whether J corresponds to an optional KIND argument or to a nonoptional
    DIM argument, so the generic cannot be resolved.

  Jim answered Van:

    Right, it seemed I didn't go deep to see what would be the outcome if
    the DIM argument is made non-optional.

  result of ballot on F08/0003:

    No change will be made as a result of these comments => F08/0003 passes
    unchanged


F08/0005*  optional arguments and ASSOCIATED - subsumed by F08/0004

  Van Snyder's Comment on F08/0005:

    Yes if F08/0004 fails, else irrelevant.

  Jim Xia's comment on F08/0005:

    The letter ballot says this interp number is also F08/0004

  Bill Long's Comment on F08/0005:

    The first line is "NUMBER: F08/0004". I assume the 0004 should be 0005.
    Similarly, in the last line, "F08/0004 submitted" the 0004 should be
    0005.

  result of ballot on F08/0005:

    The typos in F08/0005 will be fixed.  F08/0004 passed so there will be
    no further processing on F08/0005


F08/0006   generic resolution with banned argument combinations

  Bill Long's Comment on F08/0006:

    The form of Q1 is "does A happen or does B happen?" The answer is
    basically "No, B happens".  Answer A1 would be better worded if "No,
    generic" was replaced by "Generic".

    A3 looks backwards. It should be similar to A2. The question is worded
    like Q2 - should the compiler reject the intrinsic and look, instead
    for a user-provided intrinsic that had a matching signature.  I think
    the answer should be: "Yes. The processor cannot resolve the reference
    to the intrinsic RANDOM_SEED since the definition of the intrinsic
    RANDOM_SEED requires exactly one or no arguments. Generic resolution
    would continue searching for another match in the generic definition if
    there are any. If no match is found, the CALL is illegal."

  Malcom Cohen's Comment on F08/0006:

    I think the answer to F08/0006 is perhaps subtly wrong.  The bit where
    it says "the entire definition" implies that CHAR('xxx') should not
    resolve to the intrinsic but to a host-accessible user function (the
    user function has to be accessible only by host association, otherwise
    it overrides the intrinsic anyway).  Worse, with CHAR(var) when
    LEN(var)/=1 at runtime, it calls the user function, but with
    LEN(var)==1 at runtime, it calls the intrinsic.  This is obviously
    unworkable!  This affects many of the intrinsic functions, not just
    CHAR.

    So it looks like F08/0006 needs more work.  Possibly instead of "the
    entire description", "any explicit requirements on the presence or
    absence of arguments" would be ok, but it's a bit late to just drop
    totally new wording into it.  Actually, getting this right (whatever
    "right" means) probably requires an edit to the standard to say what
    exactly has to be "consistent" with the reference to the intrinsic.

    Rather than raise this issue at the WG5 level, maybe we should fail
    it now.

  result of ballot on F08/0006:

    Both of Bill's rewordings are accepted, with "CALL" replaced by
    "reference" in A3.  F08/0006 will be amended.  Malcolm's comment
    needs to be investigated => F08/0006 fails.


F08/0009   Is ABS ever required to be the optional IEC 60559 abs?

  Van Snyder's Comment on F08/0009:

    I support the spirit of the interp but the wording of the edit
    is troubling.  "IEEE_SUPPORT_STANDARD (A)" is not a function, it
    is a function reference.  Something like "If A is real and the
    result of invoking the IEEE_SUPPORT_STANDARD function from the
    IEEE_ARITHMETIC module as IEEE_SUPPORT_STANDARD (A) is true...."
    would be more precise, but a bit wordy.

  Malcolm Cohen's Comment on F08/0009:

    I agree with Van the wording could be better.  Maybe inserting
    "the result of" before "IEEE_SUPPORT_STANDARD" would be sufficient.

  Bob Corbett's NO vote for F08/0009:

    The function abs defined in IEC 60559 is a recommended function,
    not a required function.  Computers have been built that implement
    all of the required features of IEC 60559 in hardware but that do
    not implement IEC compliant floating-point absolute value in
    hardware.  I have used one such computer.  That computer would
    suffer a performance penalty for implementing IEC compliant abs
    for values that are in floating-point registers.  Machines such
    as that should not be required to implement a version of ABS that
    conforms to the recommended function abs in IEC 60559 to claim
    IEC 60559 compliance through the function IEEE_SUPPORT_STANDARD.

    The proposed new text is out-of-place in Chapter 13.  It would be
    better placed in Section 14.9, paragraph 1 [page 406].  It would
    be more consistent with the other recommended functions if the
    inquiry function IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE were used instead of
    IEEE_SUPPORT_STANDARD.

  result of ballot on F08/0009:

    Bob's comment about the placement of the edit is accepted so the
    edit is changed from:

      In 13.7.2p5 [326:4+] add a new sentence to the end of the
      paragraph:

        "If A is real and IEEE_SUPPORT_STANDARD (A) function from the
         IEEE_ARITHMETIC intrinsic module is true, then the intrinsic
         function ABS (A) is compliant with the function abs described
         in IEC 60559."

    to:

      In 14.9p1 [406:15+] add a bullet after the second bullet of the
      list:

        "the IEEE function abs shall be provided by the intrinsic
         function ABS,"

    With this change => F08/0009 passes as amended


F08/0010   deallocating objects that are associated with other objects


  Bill Long's Comment on F08/0010:

    In the example code for Q1, the source line CALL SUBR(Q(1:100:11)
    is missing a closing ")" at the end.

  result of ballot on F08/0010:

    Bill's comment is accepted => F08/0010 passes as amended


F08/0011   How many times are constructed values finalized?

  Bill Long's Comment on F08/0011:

    Very minor: in the line just above the EDITS, there is a NOTE that
    says this subsumes F08/0012 (10-159).  The final paper in that
    interp is 10-159r1 rather than 10-159.

  result of ballot on F08/0011:

    Bill's comment is accepted => F08/0011 passes as amended


F08/0016   Can a vector-subscripted argument become undefined?

  Jim Xia'x Comment on F08/0016:

    A. The question part of the interp paper should be cleaned up
      1.) 6.5.3.2.2 --> 6.5.3.3.2
      2.) "As it happens, c12 already says it is not definable,..."
          what does c12 refer to?  A sentence [295:8-9] in 12.5.2.4
          seems to state the quoted restrictions.

    B. The edit proposes to remove two extra bullets that are not
       related to the original question and discussion. Should we at
      least add the references to prove the redundancy of these two
      items?
        1.) C724 seems to cover data-target in a pointer assignment
            statement.
        2.) [203:6-7] in 9.4 Internal files seems to cover internal file.

  result of ballot on F08/0016:

    Jim's comments are accepted => F08/0016 passes as amended


F08/0017   Elemental subroutine restrictions

  Van Snyder's Comment on F08/0017:

    Since elemental requires explicit interface, the first sentence
    of the edit could be a constraint.  I agree that the edit could
    be subsumed by the edit in F08/0018, since the final edit of
    F08/0018 deletes the text to which the edit in F08/0017 would
    apply.

  Malcolm Cohen's Comment on F08/0017:

    As the equivalents of these in F2003 were not constraints,
    I prefer to leave them as textual requirements.

  result of ballot on F08/0017:

    /interp agrees with Malcolm's comment => F08/0017 passes unchanged


F08/0018   Impure elemental restrictions

  Van Snyder's Comment on F08/0018:

    Since elemental requires explicit interface, the first sentence
    of the first edit [314:7+ C1290+] could be a constraint.

  Malcolm Cohen's Comment on F08/0018:

    As the equivalents of these in F2003 were not constraints,
    I prefer to leave them as textual requirements.

  result of ballot on F08/0018:

    /interp agrees with Malcolm's comment => F08/0018 passes unchanged


F08/0022   DO CONCURRENT and file i/o

  Bob Corbett's Comment for F08/0022:

    In addition to the banning the usage described in the
    interpretation, the proposed edit has the effect of banning
    nonadvancing I/O to a unit in different threads.  Consider the
    program

       PROGRAM MAIN
         DO, CONCURRENT (INTEGER :: I = 1:3)
           WRITE (*, FMT='(A)', ADVANCE = 'NO') ' ONE'
           WRITE (*, FMT='(A)', ADVANCE = 'NO') ' TWO'
         END DO
       END

    Without the edit, the program conforms to the draft standard
    and the draft standard defines the output to be

  ONE TWO ONE TWO ONE TWO

    The edit makes the program nonconformant because the program
    writes to the same record in more than one iteration.

    I included this comment because I want to be sure this change
    to the standard is understood.  I do not object to the change.
    I would have filed an interpretation request regarding the
    program shown above if the edit had not eliminated the problem
    illustrated by the program by eliminating the program from
    consideration.

  result of ballot on F08/0022:

    No change will be made as a result of this comment => F08/0022 passes
    unchanged


F08/0031   PURE INTENT(OUT) finalization

  Van Snyder's Comment on F08/0031:

    An edit to 1.6.2 also appears to be necessary, since the answer
    affects programs that conform to F03.

  Malcolm Cohen's Comment on F08/0031:

    I think that no edit to 1.6.2 is necessary.  F2003 was ambiguous
    as to whether this was permitted - see penultimate paragraph of
    interp question.

  result of ballot on F08/0031:

    /interp agrees with Malcolm's comment => F08/0031 passes unchanged


F08/0032   PURE FUNCTION result finalization

  Van Snyder's Comment on F08/0032:

    An edit to 1.6.2 also appears to be necessary, since the answer
    affects programs that conform to F03.

  Malcolm Cohen's Comment on F08/0032:

    Additional edits seem to be required:

      [24:10] 1.6.2 last sentence, "Any"->"Except as identified in this
              subclause, any".

      Note this does something different from the edit in F08/0011;
      that one is about a program with a different interpretation,
      whereas this one is making a program non-conforming.  Maybe they
      could be combined into some better weasel words (if not in an
      interp, in the next revision).

      [24:11+] 1.6.2 at end of subclause insert new paragraph:

        "Fortran 2003 permitted the result variable of a pure function
         to be finalizable by an impure final subroutine.  This is not
         permitted by this part of ISO/IEC 1539."

  Bill Long's Comment on F08/0032:

    In the example code, both of the contained procedures are named f.
    Suggested change (in case someone tries to compile this like I did):
    Make the name of the PURE Function g, and change "f%c = a" to
    "g%c = a".

  result of ballot on F03/0032:

    Both of Malcolm's edits and Bill's change are accepted => F08/0032
    passes as amended


F08/0033   PURE polymorphic finalization

  Van Snyder's Comment on F08/0033:

    An edit to 1.6.2 also appears to be necessary, since the answer
    affects programs that conform to F03.  Or maybe not if the only
    mechanism by which the problem occurs is intrinsic assignment to
    a polymorphic allocatable variable.

  Malcolm Cohen's Comment on F08/0033:

    Additional edits seem to be required:

      [24:10] Same as in F08/0032 (done once, not twice).

      [24:11+] 1.6.2 at end of subclause insert new paragraph:

        "Fortran 2003 permitted an INTENT(OUT) argument of a pure
         subroutine to be polymorphic.  This is not permitted by this
         part of ISO/IEC 1539.".

  result of ballot on F03/0033:

    Both of Malcolm's edits are accepted => F08/0033 passes as amended


F08/0038   Are pointless restrictions on DIM arguments ntended?

  Jim Xia's Comment on F08/0038:

    This interp has the same problem as F08/0003.  It misses the
    following intrinsics:

      COUNT, LBOUND, LCOBOUND, UBOUND, UCOBOUND

    in the "additional edits if if interp F08/0003 passes".

  result of ballot on F08/0038:

    See the comments for interp F08/0003 above.  No change will be made as
    a result of this comment => F08/0003 passes unchanged


F08/0039   Many-one vector subscript usage

  Van Snyder's Comment on F08/0039:

    Edit could be simplified to "is not definable and shall not
    become undefined."  If the definition of "definable" were
    changed to "capable of definition and permitted to become
    defined or undefined" the edit could could be further simplified
    to "is not definable."

  result of ballot on F08/0039:

    No change will be made as a result of this comment => F08/0039 passes

NUMBER: F08/0001
TITLE: Generic resolution with pointer dummy arguments
KEYWORDS: Generic, Pointer, Allocatable
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Consider
  INTERFACE gen
    SUBROUTINE suba(a)
      REAL,ALLOCATABLE :: a(:)
    END SUBROUTINE
    SUBROUTINE subp(p)
      REAL,POINTER,INTENT(IN) :: p(:)
    END SUBROUTINE
  END INTERFACE
  REAL,ALLOCATABLE,TARGET :: x(:)
  ALLOCATE(x(100))
  CALL gen(x)

The call to gen(x) is compatible both with suba, since x is
allocatable, and with subp, since x and p satisfy the requirements in
12.5.2.7 paragraph 2 (p is an INTENT(IN) pointer, x is an allowable
target for p).

Is this program fragment standard-conforming, and if so, which actual
procedure is called?

ANSWER:

This program was not intended to be standard-conforming.
An edit is supplied to add a sufficient requirement.

EDITS to 10-007:

[286:4] In 12.4.3.4.5p3, after "the other has the POINTER attribute",
  Insert "and not the INTENT(IN) attribute".

QUESTION:

At [10-007:111:19-23 5.6p5] it says

        A namelist group object shall either be accessed by use or host
        association or shall have its type, type parameters, and shape
        specified by previous specification statements or the procedure
        heading in the same scoping unit or by the implicit typing rules
        in effect for the scoping unit.

        A <namelist-group-object> shall not be an array dummy argument
        with nonconstant bound, a variable with nonconstant character
        length, an automatic object, a pointer, a variable of a type
        that has an ultimate component that is a pointer, or an
        allocatable array.

by [04-007:95:10 5.4 C574] which became [09-007r3:111:10 5.6 C585]:

TITLE: Is a disassociated pointer allowed as an actual DIM argument?
KEYWORDS: DIM argument
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Several intrinsic functions, such as ANY, have a DIM argument, with
the rank of the result depending upon whether it is present.  There is
a prohibition against the actual argument being an optional dummy
argument, but not against it being a disassociated pointer or
deallocated allocatable.  Is the following program standard
conforming, and if so what does it print?

  program DIM_Arg
    integer, pointer :: Dim => NULL()
    logical :: Mask(2,2) = &
      & reshape( (/ .true., .false, .false, .true. /), (/ 2, 2 /) )
    print *, shape( any(mask,dim) )
  end program DIM_Arg

The description worked until we allowed a disassociated pointer or
unallocated allocatable variable that is associated with a nonpointer
nonallocatable optional argument to be interpreted not to be present.

ANSWER:

It was intended that this program not conform.

It was an oversight that disassociated pointer and unallocated
allocatable actual arguments were not prohibited to correspond to DIM
dummy arguments for these intrinsic functions.

Edits are provided to clarify this.  These functions were intended to
behave similarly to MAXLOC et al, where this issue does not arise.

TITLE: Is TARGET argument of ASSOCIATED a pointer or nonpointer dummy?
KEYWORDS: TARGET argument of ASSOCIATED
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Is the following conforming, and if so what does it print?

  program TARGET_Arg
    integer, pointer :: Pointer
    integer, pointer :: Target => NULL()
    integer, target :: AnotherTarget
    pointer => anotherTarget
    print *, Associated(pointer,target)
  end program TARGET_Arg

DISCUSSION:

Subclause 13.7 stipulates that descriptions of arguments of intrinsic
procedures apply to actual arguments.  This leaves open the question
whether the TARGET dummy argument of ASSOCIATED is a pointer or not.

If not a pointer, being optional, it is considered by subclause
12.5.2.12 to be absent if the corresponding actual argument is
disassociated.

Thereby, the result value of ASSOCIATED (by Case(i) of the result
value clause) is true.

If the TARGET dummy argument is a pointer, the result value of
ASSOCIATED (by Case (iv) of the result value clause) is false.

ANSWER:

It is intended that the program is conforming and prints F.

Edits are provided to clarify this.

TARGET dummy argument has the POINTER and INTENT(IN) attributes.  A
nonpointer actual argument is now permitted by 12.5.2.7p2 to
correspond to an INTENT(IN) pointer dummy argument, whereupon the
dummy argument becomes pointer associated with the actual argument.
The result is that a disassociated TARGET actual argument cannot be
considered to be absent.

[13.7.16p3 330:14]

TITLE: optional arguments and ASSOCIATED
KEYWORDS: TARGET argument of ASSOCIATED
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Subsumed by F08/0004

QUESTION:

If the actual argument associated with the dummy argument TARGET
of the intrinsic function ASSOCIATED is a disassociated pointer,
is the dummy argument TARGET to be treated as an optional
argument that is not present or as an argument that is present?

ANSWER:

The dummy argument TARGET should be treated as an argument that
is present.

DISCUSSION:

This problem was created by the Fortran 2008 extension that
declares that a dummy argument is not present if it corresponds
to an actual argument that is a disassociated pointer
[12.5.2.12p1, 299:15-17].

Among the solutions that have been suggested are

     (1) removing the extension,

     (2) restricting the extension to apply only to user-defined
	 functions,

     (3) adding an exception to the extension for the intrinsic
         function ASSOCIATED,

     (4) changing the specification of ASSOCIATED in
         [17.7.16, 330:7-42] to specify two signatures.

As attractive as the first two solutions are, I initially
favored solution (3) as it caused the least change to the
language as defined in recent drafts.  I proposed to add text
to Section 12.5.2.12 specifying the exception.  Over time, I
changed my mind; I now favor solution (4).

I initially favored solution (3) over solution (4) because
solution (4) does not treat the dummy argument TARGET as not
present when the corresponding actual argument is an optional
argument that is not present.  That functionality is in
Fortran 2003, and I did not think it should be removed.  The
more I thought about the issue, the more I was convinced that
that functionality is useless except for programs written for
test suites.  I am now convinced that removing that
functionality improves the language by making it possible for
a processor to treat use of that functionality as the error
it almost certainly is.

TITLE: generic resolution with banned argument combinations
KEYWORDS: intrinsic, generic
DEFECT TYPE: interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

The specifications of some intrinsic functions and subroutines
explicitly ban certain combinations of arguments, even though
those combinations are included in the title and the argument
portion of the specification of the function or subroutine.
Examples include CMPLX and RANDOM_SEED.  Suppose one of those
intrinsic functions or subroutines is referenced with one of
the banned combinations of arguments.

Q1. If the process of generic resolution tries to resolve the
reference against the intrinsic, does it resolve the function
or subroutine to the intrinsic or should it continue trying
to resolve the function or subroutine reference?

Q2. For example, given the function reference

      CMPLX(Z, R)

where Z is COMPLEX and R is REAL, should the processor resolve
the generic reference to the intrinsic even if it could be
resolved to a user-defined function with the same signature
later in the process of resolving the reference?

Q3. Similarly, given the subroutine call

      CALL RANDOM_SEED(GET=A, PUT=B)

should the processor skip over the intrinsic subroutine to
possibly resolve the generic reference against a user-defined
subroutine with the same signature?

ANSWER:

The definition of the interface of an intrinsic consists of its
entire description in the standard, not just the names and
keywords in the section header of its definition.  All of that
information must be used to resolve a reference to an intrinsic.

A1. Generic resolution does not resolve to an intrinsic with
an illegal combination of arguments.  Generic resolution would
continue to search user-defined specifics of the generic if
they exist.  If no match was found, the reference is illegal.

A2. No, the given reference cannot resolve to the intrinsic CMPLX.
Generic resolution would continue searching for another match in
the generic definition if there are any.  If no match is found,
the reference is illegal.

A3. Yes. The processor cannot resolve the reference to
the intrinsic RANDOM_SEED since the definition of the intrinsic
RANDOM_SEED requires exactly one or no arguments. Generic resolution
would continue searching for another match in the generic definition if
there are any. If no match is found, the reference is illegal.

                         J3 letter ballot 10-199

  Malcom Cohen's Comment on F08/0006 in 10-xxx:

    I think the answer to F08/0006 is perhaps subtly wrong.  The bit where
    it says "the entire definition" implies that CHAR('xxx') should not
    resolve to the intrinsic but to a host-accessible user function (the
    user function has to be accessible only by host association, otherwise
    it overrides the intrinsic anyway).  Worse, with CHAR(var) when
    LEN(var)/=1 at runtime, it calls the user function, but with
    LEN(var)==1 at runtime, it calls the intrinsic.  This is obviously
    unworkable!  This affects many of the intrinsic functions, not just
    CHAR.

    So it looks like F08/0006 needs more work.  Possibly instead of "the
    entire description", "any explicit requirements on the presence or
    absence of arguments" would be ok, but it's a bit late to just drop
    totally new wording into it.  Actually, getting this right (whatever
    "right" means) probably requires an edit to the standard to say what
    exactly has to be "consistent" with the reference to the intrinsic.

    Rather than raise this issue at the WG5 level, maybe we should fail
    it now.

TITLE: Can zero have more than one bit sequence representation?
KEYWORDS: zero, bits
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTIONS:

Question (1):
Some processors provide two internal representations for the
integer value zero.  The ones' complement representation of signed
integers and the signed-magnitude representation of signed
integers both provide two representations for zero.  Must a
processor for such a machine use a bit sequence consisting of all
zero bits to represent zero, regardless of the internal
representation of zero?

Question (2):
The Fortran 2008 standard [13.3.1, 317:9] states

    The interpretation of a negative integer as a
    sequence of bits is processor dependent.

Could a standard-conforming processor interpret all negative
integers as a sequence of all zero bits?

ANSWERS:

Answer to question (1): Yes.  The standard does not allow for more
than one bit representation of zero.

Answer to question (2): No.  The standard specifies that the integer
value of a string of all zero bits is zero.  The standard does not
specify the integer values for bit strings when the leftmost bit is
one.  A processor could interpret all negative integers as a sequence
of a one followed by all zero bits.  It would not be a useful bit
representation but it is not disallowed.

Question (1):
The Fortran 2008 standard does not require a standard-conforming
processor to support IEEE_INVALID [14.3p8, 404:15].  If a
processor does not support IEEE_INVALID, is it required to signal
IEEE_INVALID when a NaN result is returned?

Question (2):
IEC 60559 requires the result of SQRT(+inf) to be +inf without
overflow being signaled.  IEC 60559 requires SQRT(qNaN), where qNaN
is a quiet NaN, not to signal an invalid operand exception.  Does
Fortran 2008 require SQRT(QNaN) to signal IEEE_INVALID?

Question (1): No.  If the processor does not support IEEE_INVALID,
it cannot signal IEEE_INVALID.

Question (2): No.  The standard does not specify the behavior of

        Call s21([t2(t1=t1(x),y)])         ! (g)
        Call s21([(p2,t2(x,y),i=1,10**7)]) ! (h)
      End Subroutine

The topic is how many times each final procedure is called on return
from each subroutine?

For s10, clearly f10 is called once.

For s11(a), clearly f11 is called once, and f10 is not called.

For s11(b), the standard (4.5.6.3 para 5) seems to indicate that f10
  is called.  That would not make much sense - the value of the
  structure constructor is part of the value of the array constructor,
  so calling f10 would mean that that array element would be finalized
  twice (once by f11, once by f10, in no set order).

For s11(c), the standard standard appears to say that f11 is called
  three times, once for each (nested) array constructor.  Seeing as
  how nesting array constructors is a syntactic thing that makes zero
  difference to the value - the value of [[anything]] is identical in
  every respect to the value of [anything] - this does not seem to
  make sense.

For s20, clearly f20 is called once, and f10 is called afterwards to
  finalize the parent component.

For s21(d), clearly f21 is called once, followed by f11 to finalize the
  parent components.  f20 and f10 are not called.

For s21(e), f21 and f11 are called as in s21(d); the standard implies
  that f20 and then f10 are called, but that does not make sense, the
  same as case s11(b).

For s21(f), the situation seems to be the same as s21(e); the wanted
  f21 and f11, and (unordered) the unwanted f20 and f10.

For s21(g), f21 and f11 are called as in s21(d); the standard implies
  that f10 is called to finalize t1(3) and also that f20 and then f10
  are called to finalize t2(t1=t1(3),4).  This makes even less sense
  than before, since the t1 part of the array constructor element is
  going to be finalized 3 times just because of the syntax we used.

For s21(h), f21 and f11 are called as in s21(d) to finalize the whole
  array constructor value; the standard also implies that f20 and then
  f10 are called on all of the 5000000 even-numbered elements.
  Requiring the processor to keep track of all those elements to be
  finalized on return from s21 seems rather severe.

Furthermore, an object that has been finalized is not permitted to be
referenced or defined.  That makes the multiple finalization
interpretation even more hard to understand.

Philosophically, finalization should finalize objects exactly once.

There seem to be three possibilities here.
(1) The finalizers are called multiple times, but on the separate
    entities created by the constructors.  For example s21(g), that is
    t1(3) is created as object X, when t2(...) is evaluated a new
    separate object Y is created and that value is copied into it, and
    when [...] is evaluated a third object Z is created with the value
    of Y copied into it; afterwards, we effectively have
       call f10(X); call f20(Y); call f21(Z); call f11(Z%t1)
    For s21(h) that burden is going to be extreme because the standard
    says these are "finalized after execution of the innermost
    executable construct containing the reference" (and it is possible
    to detect this in a conforming program); changing that to
    "finalized after the value has been used" would be better if
    slightly vague.
(2) These entities are indeed finalized multiple times, just as the
    standard implies.
(3) Constructors that are merely providing part of the value of a
    bigger constructor are not finalized.
(4) Constructors should never be finalized in themselves, this was
    just a design error that inevitably leads to multiple or
    unwanted finalization.

Which is the correct approach?

ANSWER:
Approach 4.  Constructors don't do anything that needs finalization.

The topic is how many times each final procedure is called on return
from each subroutine?

Clearly, the final procedures are not called on return from the calls
not marked with an asterisk.

For the ones marked with an asterisk, the situation is less clear.
The standard says that a structure constructor or array constructor
is finalized
  "[if] an executable construct references [it]"
(4.5.6.3p5).
However, the term "reference" is not defined for these entities; the
closest would seem to be
  "appearance of a data object designator in a context requiring
   its value at that point during execution"
which would appear on the face of it to mean that these entities are
finalized since the constructor appears in a context requiring its
value.

Possible interpretations might be
(a) Yes, the entities are required to be finalized (so the relevant
    final procedure is executed).
(b) The text in 4.5.6.3p5 was not intended to be applied to
    constants (the standard is defective).
(c) The processor can optionally evaluate an alternative expression
    with the same value, viz an named constant, so it is processor
    dependent whether the finalizer is called.

Option (a) seems inconsistent with named constants otherwise being
equivalent to their constant expression.

Option (c) argument could be equally applied to nonconstant
constructors, so this would make all finalization of constructed
values optional.  That would seem inconsistent with the purpose
of finalization.

The topic is how 4.5.6.3 paragraphs 1 and 9 interact.
The relevant texts are, respectively:
  "When an allocatable entity is deallocated, it is finalized."
  "When an intrinsic assignment statement is executed, the variable
   is finalized after evaluation of <expr> and before the definition
   of the variable."

In the assignment marked (*1), paragraph 9 says that the variable (X)
is finalized, i.e.
  CALL F11(X)
is executed.  However, this would be invalid, because an unallocated
allocatable would be associated with a nonallocatable nonoptional
dummy argument.

In the assignment marked (*2), paragraph 9 again says that the
variable is finalized - after evaluation of <expr> but before the
definition of the variable.  However, because the shapes of the
variable and the expression differ, definition of the variable
involves deallocating the variable (and allocating it with the correct
shape).  Paragraph 1 says that deallocating the variable finalizes it,
so that means that F11 should be called twice for the variable.  This
is problematic since a finalized entity is not permitted to be
referenced or defined by a final subroutine.

In the assignment marked (*3), the variable and expression have the
same shape so the variable will not be deallocated, so according to
paragraph 9 it should be finalized once.

Q1. Are all the assignment statements standard-conforming?

Q2. How many times is the variable finalized (i.e. how many times is
    the final subroutine called) in each standard-conforming case?

ANSWER:

A1. Yes, all the assignment statements are intended to be standard
    conforming.  Edits are supplied to correct the problem in (*1).

A2. The variable is finalized exactly once, except when it was
    unallocated (and then it is not finalized).  Edits are supplied to
    correct the problem in (*2).

Consider the program:

        x( [1,4,9] ) = t1(1.5)
        Print *,x
      End Program

According to 6.5.3.2.2 Vector subscript,
  "An array section with a vector subscript shall not be ...
   argument associated with a dummy array that is defined or
   redefined ..."

Therefore the program above is not standard-conforming; however it
seems that deleting the assignment statement marked (*) would make the
program standard-conforming.

This seems to make final subroutines not useful when vector subscripts
are involved; either the finalization doesn't do anything to the
object in which case the vector subscript is allowed, or it does do
something (like deallocation) in which case the vector subscript is
disallowed.

Also, since passing vector-subscripted objects as actual arguments is
almost certainly going to pass a copy (and what's more a copy that
won't be copied back), this results in something other than the actual
entity being finalized - and this is possibly visible if pointers and
targets are involved.

Finally, these apparent violations of the standard are probably not
going to be detected on many processors, resulting in silent wrong
answers.  At least if vector subscripted sections being finalized were
rejected at compile time the user would stand a chance of avoiding
these problems.

Q. Is this analysis correct, and is this situation deliberate?

A. The analysis is correct.  This should have been alleviated by
   allowing elemental procedures to modify vector-subscripted

But what if the derived type is not accessible to the host scope?

Consider the module:

  module m

How can we predict the future?

And even if we could, it implies that it would be ok for the dummy
array to be undefined (because it only forbids becoming defined).

As it happens, 12.5.2.4p18 [295:8-9] already says it is not
definable, so already covers being defined and redefined - and also
becoming undefined, and also prevents not just INTENT(OUT) or INOUT

Consider the following elemental subroutine

  ELEMENTAL SUBROUTINE test_add(a,b)

    REAL c

  END SUBROUTINE

and the following reference:

  REAL x(10),y

  ...
  CALL IEEE_SET_FLAG(IEEE_OVERFLOW,.FALSE.)
  CALL test_add(x,y)
  CALL IEEE_GET_FLAG(IEEE_OVERFLOW,toobig)

The subroutine test_add does not do anything useful other than to
set the IEEE_OVERFLOW flag when x+y would overflow.

Is this program fragment standard-conforming?

12.8.3 says
  "In a reference to an elemental subroutine, either all actual
   arguments shall be scalar, or all actual arguments corresponding to
   INTENT (OUT) and INTENT (INOUT) dummy arguments shall be arrays of
   the same shape and the remaining actual arguments shall be

Obviously, it is not the case that all actual arguments are scalar.
However, there not being any actual arguments corresponding to
INTENT(OUT) or INTENT(INOUT) dummy arguments, it is not possible for
the remaining actual arguments (x and y) to be conformable with them.

Is this an oversight?  (If not, it seems a very clumsy way of
requiring elemental subroutines to have an INTENT(OUT) or
INTENT(INOUT) argument, and one that doesn't work if they are only
referenced with scalar arguments.)

TITLE: FINDLOC and logical arguments
KEYWORDS: Intrinsic, Function
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Consider
  REAL :: array(1000),value
  COMPLEX :: carray(1000),cvalue
  LOGICAL :: ilarray(1000),ilvalue
  ...
  PRINT *,FINDLOC(array,value)
  PRINT *,FINDLOC(carray,cvalue)
  PRINT *,FINDLOC(ilarray,ilvalue)

Are any of the references to FINDLOC standard-conforming?

13.7.61 requires of the VALUE argument that it
   "shall be ... in type conformance with ARRAY, as specified in Table
   7.2 for relational intrinsic operations 7.1.5.5.2).".

Yes, there is an unpaired parenthesis.

More to the point:
 (a) Table 7.2 is in 7.1.5.1 not in 7.1.5.5.2;
 (b) there is no table about type conformance in 7.1.5.5.2,
 (c) for type logical, the comparison is allegedly done by .EQV.,
     but that is not a relational operator.

It could be argued that the reference to 7.1.5.5.2 is just misleading,
and reading the rest of the sentence we should indeed use Table 7.2,
with the conformance as specified for the relational operators.  That
would make the first reference to FINDLOC conforming.

The second reference to FINDLOC is more problematic, because some
relational operators permit complex arguments (e.g. .EQ.) and some do
not (.LE.).  This makes it ambiguous as to whether or not it is
conforming.

The third reference to FINDLOC is the most problematic, because no
relational operators permit logical arguments.  Later on, FINDLOC
says it uses .EQV. for logical comparison, but .EQV. is a logical
operator not a relational operator, so in any case VALUE cannot
satisfy the rules in Table 7.2.

ANSWER:

These were all intended to be standard-conforming.  Edits are supplied
to correct the requirement.

EDITS to 10-007:

[347:31-32] In 13.7.61p3, VALUE argument, replace "for ... )" by
            "for the operator == or the operator .EQV.".
{NB: Use the same operators as specified in 13.7.61p6.  Use
 disjunction to avoid misinterpreting it as requiring both at once.}

QUESTION:

The standard states [178:15-16] that
  "An input/output statement shall not write data to a file record or
   position in one iteration and read from the same record or position
   in a different iteration."

In the loop

  DO CONCURRENT (i=1:2)
    IF (i==1) READ(17,REC=100) x    ! (a)
    IF (i==2) WRITE(17,REC=100) y   ! (b)
  END DO

The input/output statement at (a) only reads data from the file, it
does not write it, and thus does not fall foul of this restriction.
Similar reasoning shows that the input/output statement at (b) also
obeys this restriction.

Is this fragment intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

No, the example is not intended to be standard-conforming.  An edit is

TITLE: DO CONCURRENT and POINTER
KEYWORDS: DO CONCURRENT, POINTER

STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Consider the following example:

  REAL,POINTER :: x(:)
  REAL y(4)
  DO CONCURRENT (i=1:4)
    IF (IAND(i,1)==1) THEN
      ALLOCATE(x(i))
      x = 3           ! Note: defines x, does not reference x.
    ELSE
      y(i) = SUM(x)   ! (*) Note: references x.
      DEALLOCATE(x)
    END IF
  END DO

This is clearly not conforming, as it violates the requirement in
[178:8-9 8.1.6.7p1 second bullet]:

  "A pointer that is referenced in an iteration either shall be
   previously pointer associated during that iteration, or shall not
   have its pointer association changed during any iteration."

However, consider example 2, identical except for replacing the (*)
statement with:

      y(i) = SIZE(x)   ! (*) Note: SIZE does not reference x.

That statement does not reference x (see definition of reference at
1.3.120) and so does not violate the requirement.

An even simpler example which does not violate the requirement but
which appears problematic is

  POINTER p
  NULLIFY(p)
  DO CONCURRENT(i=1:2)
    IF (i==1) ALLOCATE(p)
    IF (i==2) PRINT *,ASSOCIATED(p)
  END DO

A third example which does not violate the requirement but again
appears to be problematic is

  PROCEDURE(),POINTER :: p,q
  EXTERNAL a,b
  p => a
  DO CONCURRENT(i=1:2)
    IF (i==1) p => b
    IF (i==2) q => p    ! (*1)
  END DO
  CALL q                ! (*2)

Note that (*1) does not reference p, but (*2) does reference q.
The pointer q is only set by one iteration, so no problem there.

Were these examples intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

No, the examples were not intended to be standard-conforming.  An edit
is supplied to correct the requirement.

Comment: We don't need to require "pointer associated" for
         "reference", that is always required for references.
         What we need to require is for the pointer association
         status to be established.

The rules for arguments of elemental subroutines means that CALL (a)

QUESTION:

Consider the following example:

  REAL,POINTER :: x(:)
  REAL y(4)
  ...
  DO CONCURRENT (i=1:4)
    IF (IAND(i,1)==1) ALLOCATE(x(i),STAT=j)
    ...
    y(i) = SUM(x)
    IF (IAND(i,1)==1) DEALLOCATE(x,STAT=j)
  END DO

This is clearly not conforming, as it violates the requirement in
[178:5-6 8.1.6.7 p1 first bullet]:

  "A pointer that is referenced in an iteration either shall be
   previously pointer associated during that iteration, or shall not
   have its pointer association changed during any iteration."

However, consider example 2, identical except for replacing the first
statement with:

  REAL,ALLOCATABLE :: x(:)

This satisfies the first restriction for allocatables - if
allocated by more than one iteration, it shall be subsequently
deallocated by that iteration.  The second restriction for
allocatables - that it not be referenced by a different iteration -
only applies to allocatables allocated/deallocated by a single
iteration, not by multiple iterations.

Together with use of STAT= and a previously allocated array, this
allows cross-iteration dependencies.

Q1. Was this intended to be standard-conforming?

Consider example 3

  REAL,ALLOCATABLE :: x(:)
  ALLOCATE(x(10))
  DO CONCURRENT(i=1:2)
    IF (i==1) THEN
      DEALLOCATE(x)
    ELSE IF (ALLOCATED(x)) THEN
      PRINT *,'Iteration 2 happened first'
    ELSE
      PRINT *,'Iteration 1 happened first'
    END IF
  END DO

This does not fall foul of the restrictions because using ALLOCATED
does not "reference" x.

Q2. Was this intended to be standard-conforming?

Consider example 4

  REAL,ALLOCATABLE :: x(:)
  ...
  ALLOCATE(x(999))
  DO CONCURRENT (i=1:3)
    IF (i>1) ALLOCATE(x(i))
    X = 3
    DEALLOCATE(x)
  END DO

Again, the reference and DEALLOCATE in an iteration that does not
ALLOCATE it is permitted because it is ALLOCATEd in more than one
iteration.  This would not have been permitted if x had been a
pointer.

Q3. Was this intended to be standard-conforming?

The second allocatable restriction says [178:13-14]:

  "An allocatable object that is ... deallocated in only one iteration
   shall not be deallocated ... in a different iteration."

This does not achieve anything, since the "deallocated ... in a
different iteration" means that it is deallocated in more than one
iteration in the first place.

Q4. What is the meaning of this restriction?

ANSWER:

No, the examples were not intended to be standard-conforming.
The restriction is faulty; an edit is supplied to correct it.

TITLE: G0 edit descriptor and floating-point output
KEYWORDS: G edit descriptor, 0 width
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

For data types other than floating-point, the effect of the G0 edit
descriptor is precisely defined.  For floating-point output, the
effect is precisely defined only if the value is an IEEE NaN or
Infinity, the result is otherwise left up to the processor to select
"reasonable" values for w, e, and d (if d is unspecified).

The standard states [258:7-9 10.7.5.2.2p2]:

      "the G0 and G0.d edit descriptors follow the rules for the
       Gw.dEe edit descriptor, except that any leading or trailing
       blanks are removed".

One might deduce from the wording of this that there is no upper limit
on the choice of w, since the production of additional leading (or
trailing) blanks has no effect on the output.

Q1. Is a value for w or e that results in the field being filled with
    asterisks reasonable?  This is not, after all, an error condition.

Q2. Is a value for d that results in significant loss of precision
    reasonable?  E.g. d==1, or for a less extreme example,
    d==PRECISION(value)/2.

Q3. Is a value for d that produces many more digits than the precision
    reasonable?  E.g. d==1000000.  Or, for a less extreme example,
    d==PRECISION(quad) with a single precision value.

Q4. Is a value for e that produces many more digits in the exponent
    than the exponent range reasonable?  E.g. e==1000000.

Q5. If the standard cannot tell me what "reasonable" means, what
    purpose does it serve for it to say that it must be reasonable?
    I cannot see how to tell whether a processor conforms to the
    standard in this respect.

DISCUSSION:

The standard permits, but does not require, the "best" values of w, d
or e to be chosen for each internal value.

ANSWER:

A1. No, that is not reasonable.  An edit is supplied to clarify the
    meaning of "reasonable".

A2. No, a value of d that results in a significant loss of precision
    is not reasonable.  An edit is supplied to correct this.

A3. No, it is not reasonable for d to be ridiculously large.
    An edit is supplied to clarify the intent.

A4. No, e should not be bigger than that required to represent the
    largest finite machine-representable number.  An edit is
    supplied to specify this.

A5. Yes, the use of the word "reasonable" in this context is entirely
    meaningless.  An edit is supplied to remove this misleading
    terminology.

EDITS to 10-007:

In 10.7.5.2.2, paragraph 2:

[258:9] "Reasonable processor-dependent" -> "Processor-dependent".
{A5.}

[258:10] After "value" insert
  ", that do not result in the field being filled with asterisks".
{A1.}

[258:10] Append new sentences to paragraph:
  "The value of <d> shall not result in the production of an output
   value that differs from the internal value by more than
   100*SPACING(value), and shall not be more than two larger than the
   maximum number of digits that might be required to distinguish
   between two different machine numbers of the kind of the internal
   value.  The value of <e> shall not be so large that the exponent
   would have a leading zero both when the internal value is the
   largest finite machine number and when it is the smallest finite
   machine number of that kind."
{The first sentence limits the choice of <d> to lose no more than 2
 digits of precision (A2) and to have no more than 2 spurious digits
 of  precision (A3); for some floating-point formats, the upper bound
 is not strong, being d <= 2+MAX(PRECISION(value)+2,RANGE(value)*2).
 The second sentence would allow e==4 for a lop-sided exponent range,
 e.g. -1100 to +900, but would limit e to at most 3 if the exponent
 range is e.g. -308 to +308 (A4).
 Neither of these restrictions prevent a processor from producing
 fewer mantissa or exponent digits for particular values if that does
 not result in serious loss of accuracy.}

Consider the program

Program example
  Integer :: x(3) = (/ 1,2,3 /)

  Print 2,x
2 Format(1x,*('a',I0,'b'))

3 Format(1x,999999999('a',:,',',I0,'b'))
  Print 4,x
4 Format(1x,*('a',:,',',I0,'b'))
End Program

According to the first statement of 10.4p8 [249:12-13],

  "If format control encounters the rightmost parenthesis of a
   complete format specification and another effective item is not
   specified, format control terminates."

This means that the first two lines of output should be
 a1ba2ba3ba
 a1ba2ba3b

and the second two lines of output should be
 a,1ba,2ba,3ba
 a,1ba,2ba,3b

But according to Note 10.7,

  "The effect of an unlimited-format-item is as if its enclosed list
   were preceded by a very large repeat count."

which it manifestly is not.

Is the normative text correct or the note?

ANSWER:

The note is correct.  In the example above the output of the first two
lines should be the same and equal to the first of the two lines and
the second two lines should be the same and equal to the first of those
two lines.

STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Consider
  MODULE m
    TYPE t
      ...
    CONTAINS
      FINAL f
    END TYPE
    INTEGER :: fcount = 0
  CONTAINS
    SUBROUTINE f(x)
      TYPE(t),INTENT(INOUT) :: x
      ...
      fcount = fcount + 1
    END SUBROUTINE
    PURE SUBROUTINE zap(x)                ! (1)
      TYPE(t),INTENT(OUT) :: x
    END SUBROUTINE
    PURE SUBROUTINE bad(y)
      TYPE(t),INTENT(INOUT) :: y
      CALL zap(y)                         ! (2)
    END SUBROUTINE
  END MODULE

Clearly, even though subroutine zap is pure, invoking it causes impure
final subroutine f to be called and so therefore it cannot be invoked
in any context that requires it to be pure.

Thus the call marked (2) is invalid.

The question is whether the subroutine definition itself (marked (1))
is standard-conforming.  If finalization of INTENT(OUT) arguments is
considered to be done by the called procedure, then the subroutine
definition is not standard-conforming.  If finalization of INTENT(OUT)
arguments is done by the caller, the subroutine definition might be
standard-conforming.

It would certainly seem a bit strange to be able to define a PURE
procedure that cannot be invoked anywhere purity is required.

DISCUSSION:

Although the phrase "When a procedure is invoked" sounds like
finalization occurs in the caller of a procedure and not in the called
procedure, being PURE or having a finalizable INTENT(OUT) dummy
argument are not grounds for an explicit interface to be required.

This would appear to require, as a matter of practicality, that the
processor performs the finalization of the actual argument on entry to
the called procedure.  I.e., that the impure final subroutine will in
actuality be called from the pure procedure.

ANSWER:

Allowing a PURE procedure to cause invocation of impure final
procedures in this way was inadvertant.  An edit is supplied to
clarify that any INTENT(OUT) dummy arguments of a PURE procedure must
not have a relevant impure FINAL procedure.

NOTE TO J3: This interpretation request has an interaction with
            interp F08/0034 (10-184).
            Care should be taken to keep these consistent.
(This note should be removed in due course.)

QUESTION:

Consider
  MODULE m
    TYPE t
      REAL c
    CONTAINS
      FINAL f
    END TYPE
    INTEGER :: fcount = 0
  CONTAINS

    END FUNCTION
  END MODULE

Even though this function is PURE, invoking it will inevitably result
in the execution of the impure FINAL subroutine f.  Thus, it cannot be
used within another PURE procedure or from within a DO CONCURRENT
loop, though it can be used from within a FORALL (because the
finalizations only get done on termination of the outermost FORALL).

Some other cases of impure finalization are prohibited by C1284, but
not this because it does not occur "in" the procedure.

Should an impurely-finalizable function result be allowed for a pure
function?

ANSWER:

No, this should not be allowed.  An edit is supplied to correct this
oversight in the requirements for pure procedures.

  TYPE(root) w,x(100)
  TYPE(t) y(100),z
  ...
  CALL process(x,w) ! (1)
  CALL process(y,z) ! (2)

The procedure reference at (1) will execute process with the dynamic
types of its dummy arguments being TYPE(root); the finalization of the
array elements caused by the defined assignment in the FORALL
statement will execute only the pure procedure pf, so all is well.

However, the procedure reference at (2) will execute process with the
dynamic types of its dummy arguments being TYPE(t); the finalization
of the array elements in this case will additionally call the impure
final procedure f, so all is not well.

However, this cannot be detected at compilation time.  But constraint
C1284 requires diagnosis of this error.

Surely some mistake?  Either the constraint cannot be a constraint
(which would be bad, since a design goal of pure procedures is that
violation of purity can be detected at compile time), or polymorphic
arguments to pure procedures need to be restricted in some way.

Q1. Should polymorphic INTENT(OUT) arguments to pure procedures be
    allowed?

Note that finalization can also occur via DEALLOCATE of an ALLOCATABLE
or POINTER dummy argument that is not INTENT(IN).

Q2. Should ALLOCATABLE and POINTER dummy arguments of pure procedures
    be allowed to be polymorphic and not INTENT(IN)?  Or should
    deallocation of any polymorphic subobject of a dummy argument
    simply be disallowed?

Note that problematic (as in undecidable at compile time) finalization
can also occur via DEALLOCATE of a non-polymorphic component of a
non-INTENT(IN) argument if it has a subobject that is an ALLOCATABLE
polymorphic component.

Furthermore, such deallocation can occur via intrinsic assignment.

Q3. Should this be constrained in some way?

ANSWER:

A1. This interaction between polymorphism, finalization, and purity is
    inadvertent.  An INTENT(OUT) argument of a pure procedure should
    not be allowed to be polymorphic; an edit is supplied to correct
    this mistake.

A2. Yes, deallocation of any polymorphic entity should be forbidden in
    a pure procedure.  An edit is supplied to correct this.

A3. Any statement that might result in a deallocation that is
    forbidden should not be allowed in a pure procedure.  An edit is
    supplied, with a note.

  CALL zap2(b)    ! (3)

The question is which CALL statements result in finalization and thus
deallocation of the various vec components.

If the finalization of an INTENT(OUT) argument is considered to happen
"on invocation" in the caller, then presumably the CALL statements
marked (1) and (4) will result in deallocation.

On the other hand, if the finalization of an INTENT(OUT) argument is
considered to be done in the called procedure, then arguably it is the
CALL statements marked (1) and (2) instead that will result in
deallocation.

In either case some clarification would seem to be useful.

Q. Which statements result in deallocation of the vec components?

ANSWER:

A. The finalization is considered to occur in the called procedure,
   so the statements marked (1) and (2) will result in deallocation of
   the vec components.

Note that this is consistent with the answer to interp F08/0031
(10-181r1).

TITLE: Maximum value for SHIFT argument to SHIFTL and SHIFTR
KEYWORDS: SHIFTL, SHIFTR, BIT_SIZE
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

A significant part of the justification for the addition of the
redundant SHIFTL and SHIFTR intrinsic functions was that in the case
of a nonconstant SHIFT argument, the generated code needed to test the
shift direction and that such tests were inefficient.

However, it is not uncommon for the actual hardware shift instructions
to only shift the argument modulo the bit size, for either 32-bit or
64-bit shifts, or both.  Since SHIFT is allowed to be equal to the bit
size, this means that tests still need to be done to check for this
case.

Since being able to generate the value zero by shifting an arbitrary
nonzero argument completely, applying the feature justification leads
one to surmise that perhaps SHIFT should have been limited to
BIT_SIZE-1 instead of BIT_SIZE.

Q. Should the maximum value of the SHIFT argument to the SHIFTL and
   SHIFTR intrinsics be BIT_SIZE or BIT_SIZE - 1?

Note: A similar argument does not apply quite so straightforwardly to
      SHIFTA, since it provides new functionality.

ANSWER:

A. Although allowing SHIFTL and SHIFTR by BIT_SIZE provides little
   useful functionality, this is allowed for consistency with ISHFT.

TITLE: Are pointless restrictions on DIM arguments intended?
KEYWORDS: DIM argument, optional, intrinsic reduction function
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

DISCUSSION:

Some of the reduction functions have two forms, one with a DIM
argument and one without; the DIM argument is not optional.  IALL is
an example.  Other reduction functions have a DIM argument that is
optional.  COUNT is an example.  The actual argument corresponding to
the DIM actual argument is prohibited from being an optional dummy
argument in both cases.  The reason in the case of an optional DIM
argument is so that the processor can determine the rank of the
result.  In the case of those with two forms, there is no problem for
the processor to determine the rank, so the prohibition against the
corresponding actual argument being an optional dummy argument is
pointless.  There is already a prohibition against it being an absent
optional dummy argument in 12.5.2.12p3(4).

Consider, for example

  subroutine S ( ARRAY, DIM )
    integer, intent(in) :: ARRAY(:,:)
    integer, intent(in), optional :: DIM
    if ( present(dim) ) then
      print *, iall(array,dim)
    else
      print *, iall(array)
    end if
  end subroutine S

This subroutine clearly does not conform, but a processor would have
no difficulty determining the rank of the result of IALL(ARRAY,DIM).

QUESTION:

(1) Was the pointless restriction intentional, or was it an oversight
that it did not get removed in the two-form case when MAXLOC etc. were
added?

(2) Is it necessary to continue the pointless restriction?

ANSWER:

(1) This was an oversight.

(2) No.  Edits are provided to remove it.
