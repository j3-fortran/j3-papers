I would like to express my thanks to Richard Maine and Bill Long
(specially Richard) for help with this paper.

This is a follow-up to the papers on interoperability (02-136, 02-137)
that I sent to the last meeting. I am, of course, delighted that
so many of my suggestions were accepted. I have re-read this
part of the standard and would like now to suggest the following.

28:2+. Add 'END ENUM' to the list.

43:20-21. Change
    'a C struct type with which an entity of the derived type is
  interoperable (15.2.3)'
to
  'the C struct type with which the derived type is
  interoperable (15.2.3)'.
[Section 4 is about types and 15.2.3 is about interoperability of
types.]

64:23. Set 'enumerator' in italics.

64:29-65:1. Change
   'an entity of type integer with that kind is interoperable (15.2)
   with an entity of the corresponding C enumeration type'
to
   'a type integer with that kind is interoperable (15.2.1) with
   the corresponding C enumeration type'.

71:32. Change 'subprogram or interface body' to 'procedure'.
  [We need to allow for ENTRY. There is no need to mention 'interface
  body' explicitly. This is simply one mechanism for giving the
  attribute to a procedure. For example, 12.4.1 makes no mention of
  interface blocks, but a procedure written in another language may
  use keyword arguments as long as it has an interface block. ]

77:10-11. Change to

  The BIND attribute for a variable or common block specifies that it
  is interoperable, that is, it may interoperate with a C variable with
  external linkage (15.3).

[The present wording suggests to me that there has to be such a C
variable.]

87:6. Add to the end of C558 'and the entity shall be an interoperable
variable (15.2.4, 15.2.5)'.
[As it stands, any entity may be given the bind attribute.  I assume
that the BIND statement is not intended to be applicable to a derived
type or procedure. If it is, then more work is needed on the
constraints here.]

87:10. Change '15.2' to  '15.2.4, 15.2.5'.

87:11. Change 'entities' to 'variables and common blocks'.
[Remind the reader that the BIND statement is not available for
procedures or types.]

277:15. Change 'whose interface' to 'that'.
[The BIND attribute is a characteristic of a procedure, see 12.2.
It may, of course, be specified by an interface block.]

282:22-23. Change to

  The BIND attribute for a procedure specifies that it is interoperable,
  that is, it may interoperate with a C function with external linkage.

[The present wording suggests to me that there has to be such a C
function.]

381:14-15. Change ', C_NULL_CHAR ... C_VERTICAL_TAB,' to 'and the first
column of Table 15.2'.

381:15. Change 'C_LOC, C_ASSOCIATED' to 'the procedures specified in
15.1.2'. [Need to include C_F_POINTER.]

383:1. Change 'target' to 'TARGET'.

383:2. Change 'has' to 'is of'.

383:8. Change 'object' to 'entity'.

384:7-9. Delete the J3 internal note and replace lines 7-9 by

  The following subclauses define the conditions under which a Fortran
  entity is interoperable. If a Fortran entity is interoperable, an
  equivalent entity may be defined by means of C and the Fortran entity
  is said to be interoperable with the C entity.  There does not have to
  be such an interoperating C entity.

384:20+. Add paragraph:

  An intrinsic type and type parameters is <<interoperable>> if it is
  interoperable with a C type.

386:4. Change to

  15.2.3  Interoperability of derived types and C struct types

  A Fortran derived type is <<interoperable>> if it has the BIND
  attribute.

and move lines 11-17 to follow this. After these, add

   NOTE 15.10a
   The syntax rules and their constraints require that a derived type
   that is interoperable has components that are all data objects that
   are interoperable. No component is permitted to be a procedure or
   allocatable, but a component of type C_PTR may hold the C address
   of such an entity.

387:1-4. Change to

  15.2.4 Interoperability of scalar variables

  A scalar Fortran variable is <<interoperable>> if its types and type
  parameters are interoperable, it is not polymorphic, and it has neither
  the pointer nor the allocatable attribute.

  An interoperable scalar Fortran variable is interoperable with a
  scalar C entity if their types and type parameters are interoperable.

387:5. Change to

  15.2.5 Interoperability of array variables

  An array Fortran variable is <<interoperable>> if its types and type
  parameters are interoperable, it is not polymorphic, and it is of
  explicit shape or assumed size.

388:1. Change to

   15.2.6 Interoperability of procedures and procedure interfaces

   A Fortran procedure is <<interoperable>> if it has the BIND attribute,
   that is, if it is specified with a <proc-language-binding-spec>.

   C1506 (R1225) A <proc-language-binding-spec> shall not be specified for
     a procedure with a dummy argument that is an assumed-shape array,
     polymorphic, optional, a procedure, of type and type parameters
     that are not interoperable (15.2), or an asterisk.

   NOTE 15.17a
   The rules and their constraints also require that a procedure that
   is interoperable has dummy arguments that are all data objects that
   are interoperable. No dummy argument is permitted to be a procedure
   or allocatable, but a dummy argument of type C_PTR may hold the C
   address of such an entity.

   The function C_LOC may be used to find the C address of a procedure
   or allocatable object and the subroutine C_F_POINTER may be used to
   establish a Fortran pointer whose target has a given C address.

[Interoperability' of a procedure should be determined by the Fortran
syntax independently of whether there is any corresponding C
procedure.]

388:2-3. Change line 2 to

  The interface of an interoperable Fortran procedure is interoperable
  with a C function prototype if

and delete line 3 (item (1) of the list).

388:5. Change 'interface describes' to 'procedure is'.

388:7. Change 'interface describes' to 'procedure is'.

388:7. Change 'interface' to 'procedure'.

388:10-11 and J3 internal note. Delete. [See my edit for 388:1. NOTE
15.10 makes it clear that C_LOC must be employed to pass procedures.]

389:8. Delete 'procedure'.

389:9+. In NOTE 15.20, add
     INTERFACE
     END INTERFACE
  around the Fortran code.

390:0. Interchange the two USE statements in NOTE 15.21.

390:7. Delete. [More general text now in 15.2.]

391:13-392:1. Change to

   An interoperable procedure may be defined either by means other than
   Fortran or by means of a Fortran subprogram, but not both.

and do not start a new paragraph after this.

391:16-17. Delete 'that ... <subroutine-stmt>' and make this an
ordinary sentence instead of a list. [The deleted text is wrong for a
procedure defined by an entry statement.]

392:0. Delete J3 note. I cannot see that there is much scope for debate
here. There are words at the bottom of 281 explaining that RECURSIVE,
PURE, and ELEMENTAL are not used in ENTRY statements. The fact that we
have no such text for BIND and that <proc-language-binding-spec> is
part of the syntax of the ENTRY statement says that this attribute may
vary between entries to a subprogram. I claim that my edits for pages 71
and 391 fix this.

392:23+, NOTE 15.23. After the SUBROUTINE statement, add
          ..
and after the present USE statement, add
          ..
[The dots indicate that these procedures do something.]

395:18. After 'external procedures,' add 'procedure binding labels,'.

412:46-49. Change to

(16) When execution of a RETURN or END statement causes a variable to
     become undefined, any variable of type C_PTR becomes undefined if
     its value was obtained by a call of C_LOC for the variable that
     becomes undefined or any variable that was then associated with
     the variable that becomes undefined.

(17) When a variable with the TARGET attribute is deallocated, any
     variable of type C_PTR becomes undefined if its value was obtained
     by a call of C_LOC for the variable that is deallocated or any
     variable that was then associated with the variable that is
     deallocated.

[We do not want to introduce a new form of association.]

421:7+. Add <<interoperable>> (15.2). The property of a Fortran entity
that ensures that an equivalent entity may be defined by means of C.
