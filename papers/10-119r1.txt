Subject: JP-14: Underflow mode routines missing in list
Date: 2010 February 15

This paper provides edits for comment JP-14 from the Ballot summary,
N1802.

Discussion:

In 14.7 "The floating point status", the list of routines that can be
used to set and get portions of the floating-point status does not
include the routines to set and get the underflow mode. However,
underflow mode is specifically included in the first sentence of the
same paragraph as being part of the floating-point status. An edit is
provided to fix his inconsistency.

Edits to J3/09-007r3:

[407:26] In 14.7 "The floating-point status", in the last sentence of
paragraph 1, after "IEEE_GET_HALTING_MODE, ", insert
"IEEE_GET_UNDERFLOW_MODE, ".

[407:27] In 14.7 "The floating-point status", in the last sentence of
paragraph 1, after "IEEE_SET_HALTING_MODE, ", insert
"IEEE_SET_UNDERFLOW_MODE, ".
