From:    David Muxworthy and Masayuki Takata
Subject: UK proposal UK-19 COSHAPE intrinsic
Date: 2014 June 25

Status: For Consideration
Basic Functionality: Add COSHAPE intrinsic

Rationale:
It is irregular to have LCOBOUND and UCOBOUND intrinsics, but not to
have COSHAPE.

Specification:
Add COSHAPE intrinsic to return the coshape of a coarray.

Syntax:
Add new intrinsic function COSHAPE.

Edits to J3/14-007r1(= N2014):

[322] In 13.5 Standard generic intrinsic procedures, Table 13.1,
after the entry for COSH add:
"COSHAPE   (COARRAY [, KIND])    I   Sizes of codimensions of a coarray."

[340:18+] In 13.7 Specifications of the standard intrinsic procedures,
after the specification of COSH, add

13.7.5a COSHAPE (COARRAY [, KIND])

<<Description.>> Sizes of codimensions of a coarray.

<<Class.>> Inquiry function.

<<Arguments.>>
COARRAY shall be a coarray of any type. It shall not be an unallocated
        allocatable coarray.

KIND (optional) shall be a scalar integer constant expression.

<<Result Characteristics.>> Integer. If KIND is present, the kind type
parameter is that specified by the value of KIND; otherwise, the kind
type parameter is that of default integer type. The result is an array
of rank one whose size is equal to the corank of COARRAY.

<<Result Value.>> The result has a value whose <i>i<sup>th</sup></i>
element is equal to the size of codimension <i>i</i> of COARRAY.

<<Example.>> The following code allocates the coarray D with the same size
in each codimension as that of the coarray C, with the lower cobound 1.
   ALLOCATABLE :: C[:,:], D[:,:], COSHAPE_C(:)
      :
   COSHAPE_C = COSHAPE(C)
   ALLOCATE ( D[COSHAPE_C(1),COSHAPE_C(2)] )
