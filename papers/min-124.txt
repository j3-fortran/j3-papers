     2. Andrew Tait:  Make rules about the use of page and
        line numbers in S20.  A straw vote on whether they
        should appear was (21-0-3), so the rules should
        include the form and location of page and line
        numbers in S20.
     
        Status:  Pending -- Some changes made to the
        document, but no rules have been established.

        an email address that can be used for interpretation
        requests.

     4. Jerry Wagener discuss with Andrew Tait:  The
        schedule for distribution of S20 after each meeting.
        Take into consideration the need to get ballot
        results in the premeeting.  Members want S20 in
        their hands for 4 weeks, but the ballot period could
        be shorter than 30 days.
     
        Status:  Done -- The letter ballot must run for 30
        days.  Every effort will be made to distribute S20 2
        weeks after the meeting.
     
     5. Andrew Tait:  Determine a method of identifying new
        items in S20 #0000 for subsequent ballots.
     
        Status:  Pending -- The plan was to create a new
        block within item 0000.  However, there were
        objections and this will be rethought.
     
     6. Andrew Tait:  Add a new field to S20 items to
        contain the date of the last significant change of
        an item (plus a comment).
     
        Status:  Done -- See current 93-006.

     Comments from the Membership -- February 10
     Note that this was delayed until Tuesday due to lack of
             time.
     Steidel: Regarding X3J3 being a close liaison to
             X3J11.1 (NCEG), their chair asked that we
             designate someone to be a focal point and who
             can filter their mailings in order to
             distribute only the relevant items to the X3J3
             members.  [Jon ended up being that person.]
     Martin: When the results of the WG5 letter ballot are
             returned to us, the edits should be put in
             document order so that we can ensure that there
             are no collisions between them.  [An action
             item was created and assigned to Jerry Wagener
             to discuss this with Walt Brainerd.]
     Martin: Will we be able to leave the X3.9-1978
             references in when we forward this document to
             ISO?  [Several people felt that this should not
             be a problem as the interpretation is based on
             the current ISO document.  In addition, since
             we are charged with maintenance of both Fortran
             77 and Fortran 90 by ANSI, it makes sense to
             reference the Fortran 77 standard.  It was also
             felt that if the ANSI and ISO documents have to
             differ on this point, then so be it.]

     Discussion Leader: Len Moss
     Moss:   There are two models for handling requirements:
              -- Establish a procedure similar to our
             interpretations processing,            i.e.,
             every submission is logged and tracked.
              -- Establish a procedure similar to that used
             for the development of            Fortran 90,
             i.e., a request is submitted and assigned to a
             subgroup      which can choose to bring it to
             the full committee or kill it.
     Straw:  Should a majority vote of the X3J3 membership

             proposed requirements from the Fortran user
             community and describing the format to be used
             in submitting a proposed requirement to us.
     Straw:  Should the items from 93-004 which are part of

     Weaver: [Dick described the current debate going on in
             the POSIX meetings regarding the value of the
             LIS (Language Independent Standard).  He
             pointed out that Fortran is the only obvious
             beneficiary of this effort.]
     Martin: We must answer the cross language questionnaire
             for POSIX along with 4 other topics.

     Straw:  What type of letter should we write to X3T2

             a mildly negative letter, a no comment letter,
             no letter, undecided)?  Vote for all that are

3.19 Document Processing3.19  Document Processing
     Discussion Leader: Maureen Hoffert
     Hoffert: We should move to more electronic processing
             as opposed to paper processing.  The goal
             should be that anything which can feasibly be
             distributed in electronic form should be.
     Leonard: What format should be used?
     Answer: We are probably restricted to ASCII.
     Straw:  Should we move aggressively toward an
             electronic premeeting distribution with a
             secondary paper backup?  (9-0-4)

             for meeting 125.
4.5  Action Items Review4.5   Action Items Review
     1. Andrew Tait:  Make rules about the use of page and
        line numbers in 006.  A straw vote on whether they
        should appear was (21-0-3), so the rules should
        include the form and location of page and line
        numbers in 006.
     
        Status:  Pending -- Some changes made to the
        document, but no rules have been established.
        Andrew did rule that in the text of the item page
        numbers were acceptable as they are part of the
        standard and line numbers are not acceptable as they
        are not part of the standard.  At issue still is the
        presence of line numbers in our internal version of
        the 006.
     
     2. Andrew Tait:  Determine a method of identifying new
        items in 006 #0000 for subsequent ballots.
     
        Status:  Pending -- The plan was to create a new
        block within item 0000.  However, there were
        objections and this will be rethought.
     
     3. Jerry Wagener discuss with Walt Brainerd:  When we
        get the 006 items back from the WG5 ballot, the
        edits contained in the items which passed should be
        put in document order to help ensure that there are
        no collisions between them.
     
        Status:  New
     
     4. Jerry Wagener discuss with Andrew Tait:  A subgroup
        field should be added to the 006 items.
     
        Status:  New
     
     5. Andrew Tait:  Provide a ruling on the format of
        titles in the 006 items.

     Bierman: I would like to give a vote of thanks to Bill

     [The small group of people left then discussed how to
             handle the number of people leaving early.  It
             bothered most of the remaining people
             especially in light of the fact that the agenda
             was published with a 5:00 adjournment time.]
