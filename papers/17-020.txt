NUMBER: F03/0017
TITLE: Dummy procedure pointers and PRESENT
KEYWORDS: Dummy argument, procedure pointer, PRESENT
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: No edits in F2008 Corrigendum 2

QUESTION:

Does the following program conform to the Fortran standard?

  procedure(real), pointer :: F => null()
  call s ( f )
  contains
    subroutine S ( F )
      procedure(real), optional, pointer :: F
      print *, present(f)
    end subroutine S
  end

In the Fortran 2003 standard (ISO/IEC 1539-1:2004), the second
paragraph of 12.4.1.3 requires that if the dummy argument does not
have the POINTER attribute and the actual argument does, the actual
argument shall be associated.  It is not clear in 13.7.91 whether the
argument of PRESENT has or has not the POINTER attribute.

ANSWER:

The program is standard-conforming.

The Fortran 2008 standard states
  "Except in references to intrinsic inquiry functions, a pointer
   actual argument that corresponds to a nonoptional nonpointer dummy
   argument shall be pointer associated with a target."
(12.5.2.3 paragraph 1).

Since PRESENT is an intrinsic inquiry function, there is therefore no
requirement on its actual argument that if it is a pointer it shall be
associated.

QUESTION:

Q1. Does the following program unit conform to the Fortran standard?

  module M1
    type T
      integer x
    contains
      procedure :: MyAdd_t => myadd
      generic :: operator(+) => myAdd_t
    end type T
    type X
      real q
    contains
      procedure, pass(b) :: MyAdd_x => myadd
      generic :: operator(+) => myAdd_x
    end type X
  contains
    integer function MyAdd ( A, B )
      class(t), intent(in) :: A
      class(x), intent(in) :: B
      myadd = a%x + b%q
    end function MyAdd
  end module

Q2. Does the following program unit conform to the Fortran standard?

  module M2
    interface operator(+)
      procedure MyAdd
    end interface
    type T
      integer x
    contains
      procedure :: MyAdd_t => myadd
      generic :: operator(+) => myAdd_t
    end type T
  contains
    integer function MyAdd ( A, B )
      class(t), intent(in) :: A
      real, intent(in) :: B
      myadd = a%x + b
    end function MyAdd
  end module

Q3. If the interface block and type definition are exchanged in
    question 2, does the program unit conform to the Fortran standard?

ANSWER:

A1. The program unit is not standard-conforming.  Generic operator (+)
    has two ambiguous specific bindings, one to myadd_t the other to
    myadd_x.

A2. The program unit is not standard-conforming.  Generic operator (+)
    has two ambiguous specific procedures, one being the module
    procedure myadd the other being the type-bound procedure myadd_t.

A3. The ordering of the interface block and the type definition is
    immaterial.

NUMBER: F03/0019
TITLE: Multiple identical specific procedures in generic interface
       blocks
KEYWORDS: Type-bound generics
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 2

QUESTION:

Consider
  Module m12
    Interface g1
      Subroutine s
      End
    End Interface
    Interface g2
      Procedure s
    End Interface
  End Module
  Program p12
    Use m12
    Interface g1     ! (1)
      Procedure s
    End Interface
    Interface g2     ! (2)
      Procedure s
    End Interface
    Call g1
    Call g2
  End Program

It is clear that the interface block marked (2) is not conforming,
since it violates C1209 which says
  "A procedure-name shall not specify a procedure that is specified
   previously in any procedure-stmt in any accessible interface with
   the same generic identifier."

However, it is not clear whether the interface block marked (1) is
conforming, since s was specified previously by an interface-body not
a procedure-stmt, even though both (1) and (2) attempt to do the same
thing, viz create a generic interface with a duplicate specific.

An even more obscure example is
  Module mx12
    Interface g3
      Subroutine s
      End
    End Interface
    Private s
  End
  Program px12
    Use mx12
    Interface g3
      Subroutine s
      End
    End Interface
    Call g3
  End Program

Here there is clearly no violation of C1209 but it is not obvious
whether the ambiguity rules are applied or not.

ANSWER:

These examples were not intended to be conforming.
An edit is supplied to clarify.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[281:11-12] Replace C1209 entirely by

TITLE: What kind of token is a stop code?
KEYWORDS: STOP, token
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 2

QUESTION:

The <stop-code>, when it is a string of <digit>s, does not appear to
be specified by the standard to be any particular kind of token.  Or
indeed whether it is one token per <digit> or one per <stop-code>.

The answer to these questions determines whether blanks are allowed,
disallowed, or optional, in the middle of a STOP statement in free
form.

Consider the following statements:
(1) STOP 123
(2) STOP123
(3) STOP 1 2 3

Which, if any, of these statements are standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

Fortran 2008 has revised the syntax of the STOP statement.

DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 3

QUESTION:

Is infinity / 0.0 a divide by zero exception?
Is NaN / 0.0 a divide by zero exception?

Fortran 2003 defines (in 14.2) infinity / zero and NaN / zero
cases as IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO.  IEEE-754 defines (in 6.1 and 6.2)
those two as unexceptional.

ANSWER:

On an IEEE-conformant processor, these cases do not raise exceptions
(see clauses 6.1 and 6.2 of IEC 60559:1989).

The definitions in 14.2 were intended to describe IEC 60559:1989
exceptions with sufficient latitude to allow use on machines that do
not conform to IEC 60559:1989.  However, the definition of
IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO is not consistent with IEC 60559:1989.

Furthermore, the definition of the IEEE_OVERFLOW flag is also not
consistent with IEC 60559:1989, because this exception is not raised
for operations on infinite operands.

Additionally, if the data type is not an IEEE data type, but the
exception is supported, the circumstances under which the exception is
raised are processor dependent.

Edits are provided.

13.7 [300:13-15] incorrectly requires an infinite result or a
NaN result to always signal some IEEE exception.

Consider changing [300:13] "infinite result" to "infinite result
(from finite arguments)".  Reason: IEEE-754 mathematical
operations on infinity that produce an infinity are
unexceptional.

Consider changing [300:14] "NaN result" to "NaN result (from
non-NaN arguments)".  Reason: IEEE-754 mathematical operations
on quiet NaN operands that produce a quiet NaN result are
unexceptional.

Consider adding to 13.7 [300:15+] something along the lines of:
"Unless specified otherwise, a math function with NaN
argument(s) shall return a NaN, which should be one of the NaN
arguments."  This allows not having to specify the results for
each specific math function.

Consider adding the above suggested cases to each of the 13.7.*
functions, perhaps, with a bold face IEEE sub-heading.

ANSWER:

The erroneous text quoted from 13.7 in Fortran 2003 has been revised
in Fortran 2008, and again by Corrigendum 2 for Fortran 2008, and now
no longer conflicts with the IEEE-754 standard.

To specify the results of all the intrinsics for non-normal values is
beyond the scope of an interpretation.  This could be considered for a
future revision.

STATUS: No edits in F2008 Corrigendum 3

QUESTION:

The descriptions of the intrinsic procedures often use the term "type"
without qualification.  It is unclear whether they mean "declared
type" or "dynamic type".  If they mean "dynamic type", then this would
appear to allow unlimited polymorphic arguments to intrinsic
procedures like ABS and SIN.  Resolution of generic intrinsic
procedures in this case would create an undue (and likely unintended)
burden on the processor, and the declared type of the result of such a
function call would be unclear as well.

Question 1:
Are the arguments of the intrinsic functions ALLOCATED, ASSOCIATED,
LBOUND, SHAPE, SIZE, and UBOUND permitted to be polymorphic?

Question 2:
(a) Is the ARRAY argument of the intrinsic function CSHIFT permitted
    to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If the argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?  What
    are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 3:
(a) Are the ARRAY and BOUNDARY arguments of the intrinsic function
    EOSHIFT permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, then must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on their types refer to their declared types
    or dynamic types?
(d) If either argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic? What
    are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 4:
(a) Are the A and MOLD arguments of the intrinsic function
    EXTENDS_TYPE_OF permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on their types refer to their declared types
    or dynamic types?

Question 5: This question is deferred to interp F08/0102.
(a) Are the TSOURCE and FSOURCE arguments of the intrinsic function
    MERGE permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on the types of the arguments refer to their
    declared types or dynamic types?
(d) If either argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 6:
Are the FROM and TO arguments of the intrinsic function MOVE_ALLOC
permitted to be polymorphic?

Question 7:
(a) Are the ARRAY and VECTOR arguments of the intrinsic function PACK
    permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on the types of the arguments refer to their
    declared types or dynamic types?
(d) If either argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 8:
(a) Are the SOURCE and PAD arguments of the intrinsic function RESHAPE
    permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on the types of the arguments refer to their
    declared types or dynamic types?
(d) If either argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 9:
(a) Are the A and B arguments of the intrinsic function SAME_TYPE_AS
    permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on their types refer to their declared types
    or dynamic types?

Question 10:
(a) Is the SOURCE argument of the intrinsic function SPREAD permitted
    to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If the argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?  What
    are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 11:
(a) Is the SOURCE argument of the intrinsic function TRANSFER
    permitted to be polymorphic?
(b) Is the MOLD argument of the intrinsic function TRANSFER permitted
    to be polymorphic?
If the answer to (b) is yes:
(c) If the MOLD argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 12:
(a) Is the MATRIX argument of the intrinsic function TRANSPOSE
    permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If the argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?  What
    are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 13:
(a) Are the VECTOR and FIELD arguments of the intrinsic function
    UNPACK permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on the types of the arguments refer to their
    declared types or dynamic types?
(d) If either argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 14:
Are any of the other arguments of any intrinsic procedure permitted to
be polymorphic?

ANSWER:

The assertion that it is unclear whether "type" means declared, dynamic,
or both, is misguided.  The general rule is that wherever it makes
sense, it means both.  Where only one meaning makes sense, it means
that one.  Where only one meaning is intended but it would otherwise
not be clear from context, it is qualified as "declared type" or
"dynamic type".

Answer 1:
Yes.

Answer 2:
(a) Yes.
(b) Yes.  "The result is of the type ... of ARRAY".

Answer 3:
(a) Yes.
(b) No.
(c) The requirements apply to both the declared type and the dynamic
    type.
(d) "The type has ... the type ... of ARRAY".  Therefore it is polymorphic
    if ARRAY is polymorphic.

Answer 4:
(a) Yes.
(b) No.
(c) The requirements refer to the declared type; this is explicitly
    stated.

Answer 5:  This question has been deferred to interp F08/0102
   TSOURCE and FSOURCE are required have the same declared type, but may
   be polymorphic.  The questions of what the requirements are on the
   dynamic type, and whether the result is polymorphic, are deferred to
   interp F08/0102.

Answer 6:
Yes.

Answer 7:
(a) Yes.
(b) No.
(c) The requirements refer to both the declared type and the dynamic
    type.  Note that this means that if either ARRAY or VECTOR is not
    polymorphic, the requirement for type matching means that the
    dynamic type of the polymorphic argument is known.
(d) The result "has the same type" as ARRAY, and therefore is polymorphic
    if ARRAY is polymorphic.

Answer 8:
(a) Yes.
(b) No.
(c) The requirements refer to both the declared type and the dynamic
    type.
(d) The result "has the same type" as SOURCE, and therefore is polymorphic
    if and only if SOURCE is polymorphic.

Answer 9:
(a) Yes.
(b) No.
(c) The requirements are explicitly stated to refer to the declared type.

Answer 10:
(a) Yes.
(b) Yes.  "The result is ... of the same type ... as ARRAY.".

Answer 11:
(a) Yes.
(b) Yes.
(c) "The result is of the same type ... as MOLD.".

Answer 12:
(a) Yes.
(b) Yes.  The declared and dynamic types of the result are those of
    the argument.

Answer 13:
(a) Yes.
(b) Yes.
(c) The requirements refer to both the declared type and the dynamic
    type.
(d) Yes.  The result has the same declared and dynamic types as VECTOR, 
    and is polymorphic if and only if VECTOR is polymorphic.

Answer 14:
Yes.  For example, IMAGE_INDEX, LCOBOUND, PRESENT, STORAGE_SIZE, and
UCOBOUND.

9.6.4.8.3 p26 [227:17] states
  A record positioning edit descriptor, such as TL and TR, used on
  unit by a child data transfer statement shall not cause the record
  position to be positioned before the record position at the time the
  user-defined derived-type input/output procedure was invoked.

The term "record position" is used, but it doesn't appear to be
defined anywhere.  Depending on the interpretation, the above program
might be standard-conforming, or it might not be.

If "record position" is taken to mean "the position within the current
record", regardless of which record is the current record, then the
record position at the beginning of the UDDTIO procedure is before the
fourth character of the record.  The first child data transfer
statement begins a new record, and the second child data transfer
statement writes to the first character of the new record.  This would
be before the "record position" at the time the UDDTIO procedure was
invoked, and the program would not be standard-conforming.

If "record position" is taken to mean a combination of the record and
the position within that record (essentially making it mean the same
thing as "file position"), then the above program is standard-
conforming, since the control edit descriptor doesn't cause the file
to be positioned before the record position when the UDDTIO procedure
was invoked.

What is the meaning of "record position", and is the above program
standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

The term "record position" is not well defined.

The intent of 9.6.4.8.3 was to prohibit a child data transfer statement
from possibility overwriting or re-reading any characters in the current
record that an active parent I/O statement had previously written or
read.  9.6.4.8.3 should have used the term "file position" instead of
"record position".

Therefore, the program is standard-conforming, and prints
 xyz.3
AB

where the first record starts with a space and the "." represents a
value separator.

Edits are supplied to clarify the intent of 9.6.4.8.3 and remove the
phrases "record position" and "record positioning" from the standard.

NUMBER: F03/0053
TITLE: The BIND attribute for C_PTR and C_FUNPTR
KEYWORDS: BIND attribute, C_PTR, C_FUNPTR, private components
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 3

QUESTION:

1. Do the derived types C_PTR and C_FUNPTR have the BIND attribute?

This affects whether an object of one of these types is permitted
directly in COMMON.  C5101 in the Fortran 2008 standard states "If a
common-block-object is of a derived type, it shall be a sequence type
or a type with the BIND attribute and it shall have no default
initialization."

2. Whether the derived types C_PTR and C_FUNPTR have the BIND
attribute affects whether they are extensible.  Subclause 4.5.7.1 of
the Fortran 2008 standard states "A nonsequence derived type that does
not have the BIND attribute is an extensible type."  Are these types
extensible?

3. Subclause 15.3.3 of the Fortran 2008 standard states that C_PTR and
C_FUNPTR are derived types with private components. Are user-defined
derived types with the BIND attribute permitted to have private
components?

ANSWER:

1. No, these types do not have the BIND attribute.  15.3.3 does not
specify that they have the BIND attribute.  15.3.4 does not require
them to have the BIND attribute in order to make them interoperable.
15.3.5 would require them to interoperate with a C struct if they had
the BIND attribute; this is absurd, since C object pointers and C
function pointers are clearly not structs.

Note that whether these types have default initialization is not
specified by the standard, so possession of BIND would not necessarily
have allowed them in COMMON anyway.

Edits are provided to correct incomplete, and thus misleading,
statements about derived types and the BIND attribute.

2. No, these types were not intended to be extensible.  It was an
oversight that these types were not explicitly excluded from being
extensible by subclause 4.5.7.1 paragraph 1 of the Fortran 2008
standard.  An edit is provided to correct this.

3. Yes, a user-defined derived type with the BIND attribute is
permitted to have private components.  This situation is the same
as for SEQUENCE types, which are similar (but not interoperable).
As with SEQUENCE types, making a component PRIVATE does prevent
access, in a conforming program, to the component by a programmer who
is sufficiently determined; however, it continues to fulfill the
software engineering role for which it was intended.  Note further
that there are many other situations where two different Fortran
derived types will interoperate with the same C derived type; this is
not a defect in either standard, but simply a consequence of the two
languages having different approaches to type compatibility.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[19:15-16] In 1.3.147.6,
  replace the definition of "extensible type"
  with "type that may be extended using the EXTENDS clause (4.5.7.1)".
{Repair definition of extensible type.}

  After "A derived type" insert
    ", other than the type C_PTR or C_FUNPTR from the intrinsic module
     ISO_C_BINDING,"

   in C is provided by the BIND attribute on the Fortran type."
{Reduce misleading opening blather - this is just here so we didn't
 start the subclause with a bunch of constraints.  Alternatively we
 could move paragraph 2 (and note 15.12) to replace paragraph 1.}

  After "is interoperable" insert "with a C struct type".
{Correct another misleading sentence.}

[431:13-18] In 15.3.4p2,
  Change all four occurrences of "Fortran derived type"
  to "derived type";
  change the single occurrence of "Fortran type" to "derived type".

NUMBER: F03/0064
TITLE: Recursive declaration of procedure interfaces
KEYWORDS: procedure, interface
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 3

QUESTION:

Q1. Consider the following program:

      PROGRAM foo
        PROCEDURE(sub) :: p
        INTERFACE
          SUBROUTINE sub(p2)
            IMPORT p
            PROCEDURE(p) :: p2
          END SUBROUTINE
        END INTERFACE
      END PROGRAM

C1216 appears to prohibit the case of an interface name in a procedure
declaration statement being the name of something declared in a later
procedure declaration statement.  But it does not appear to prohibit
the case of an interface name being the name of something declared in
a later interface body.

In the above program, the characteristics of p rely on the
characteristics of sub.  The characteristics of sub, in turn, rely on
the characteristics of p.

Is this program standard-conforming?

Q2. Consider the module

    MODULE m1
    CONTAINS
      SUBROUTINE s(p)
        PROCEDURE(s) :: p
      END SUBROUTINE
    END MODULE

Constraint C1216 does not apply here since "s" is not declared by a
procedure declaration statement; unlike Q1, it is also not declared by
an interface body.  However, the characteristics of S have not been
determined before the procedure declaration statement has been
processed, and that cannot be processed until we know what the
interface of S is.

Is this program unit standard-conforming?

Q3. Consider the module

    MODULE m2
    CONTAINS
      SUBROUTINE s1(a)
        PROCEDURE(s2) :: a
      END SUBROUTINE
      SUBROUTINE s2(b)
        PROCEDURE(s1) :: b
      END SUBROUTINE
    END MODULE

The interface of A depends on the interface of S2, which depends on
the characteristics of B, which depends on the characteristics of S1,
which depends on the characteristics of A; a circular dependency.

Is this program unit standard-conforming?

Q4. Consider

      MODULE m3
        PROCEDURE(s),POINTER :: sptr
      CONTAINS
        SUBROUTINE s(p)
          PROCEDURE(sptr) :: p
        END SUBROUTINE
      END MODULE

In the normal course of events there is no problem declaring a
procedure pointer to have the interface of a module procedure that is
defined later, and this is desirable, but in this case there seems to
be a circular dependency between the characteristics of sptr, s, and
p.

Is this program unit standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

None of the examples are standard-conforming, as the standard does not
establish an interpretation for them.

An edit is provided to clarify this.

EDIT to 10-007r1:

[288:3] 12.4.3.6p2, append new sentence
  "The interface specified by <interface-name> shall not depend on any

STATUS: No edits in F2008 Corrigendum 2

QUESTION:

Given
  REAL X
  X = ... some value ...
may
  IF( X+3.0 .EQ. 3.0 )...
be transformed into
  IF( X .EQ. 0.0 )...
by the processor?

In Fortran 2003, 7.1.8.5 Evaluation of relational intrinsic operations
says
  "Two relational intrinsic operations are relationally equivalent if
   their logical values are equal for all possible values of their
   primaries."

On a machine where addition of 3.0 to a small value is not exact, the
logical values for X+3.0==3.0 are not the same as X==0.0 for all
possible values of X, therefore it would seem that this transformation
would not be possible.

However, Note 7.22 in Fortran 2003 shows this transformation as being
acceptable.

ANSWER:

No, a transformation across a relational operator is not permitted
unless it gives the same answer for all possible values of the
operands of the relational operator (in this case, all possible values
of X+3.0 and 3.0 versus those of X and 0.0).  Note that the standard
does not specify how the operands are to be calculated, but the
suggested transformation would not give the same answer for all
possible values of the operands in any floating-point arithmetic.

The erroneous example has been removed in Fortran 2008.

QUESTION:

Is there an error in the description for the output of a IEEE infinity
with a sign and a field width of 3 or 8?

Fortran 2008, 10.7.2.3.2 paragraph 7, [252:33-34], describes the
output of IEEE infinities; this specifies asterisks (field overflow) if
the field width is less than 3, and omission of "inity" if the field
width is less than 8.  However, this does not take into account the
fact that there might be a plus or minus sign in the field.

The current text also fails to take into account the case of <w> = 0,
for both Infinity and NaN values.

ANSWER:

Yes, there is an error in the special cases.  Edits are provided to
correctly describe the required field widths for signed infinities.
An edit is also provided to repair the description of the output of
NaN values.

KEYWORDS: dummy argument, present, polymorphic, parameterized derived

DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 2

QUESTION:

Consider
    Type t
      Real x
    End Type
    ...
    Subroutine s(x)
      Class(t),Optional :: x
      If (.Not.Present(x)) Call s2(x)
    End Subroutine
    Subroutine s2(y)
      Type(t),Optional :: y
      If (Present(y)) Print *,y
    End Subroutine

Q1. Is the reference to s2, passing a polymorphic optional argument
    that is not present to a non-polymorphic optional dummy, standard
    conforming?

Consider
    Type pdt(n)
      Integer,Len :: n
      Real x(n)
    End Type
    ...
    Subroutine s3(y)
      Type(pdt(*)),Optional :: y
      If (.Not.Present(y)) Call s4(y)
    End Subroutine
    Subroutine s4(z)
      Type(pdt(10)),Optional :: z
      If (Present(z)) Print *,z%x
    End Subroutine

Q2. Is the reference to s4, passing an optional dummy argument with an
    assumed type parameter to an optional dummy argument with a non-
    assumed type parameter, standard conforming?

    Note that 12.5.2.4 paragraph 3 requires the length type parameter
    values to be the same (with no mention of argument presence).

One might conjecture that these should not be conforming because the
argument passing conventions between s and s2, and between s3 and s4,
might be different (descriptor vs. reference).

DISCUSSION:

This does not seem to be limited to derived types, for example:
    Subroutine s3(y)
      Character(*),Optional :: y
      If (.Not.Present(y)) Call s4(y)
    End Subroutine
    Subroutine s4(z)
      Character(10),Optional :: z
      If (Present(z)) Print *,z
    End Subroutine
?

ANSWER:

These were all intended to be standard-conforming.

requirements.

TITLE: SIZE= specifier and UDDTIO
KEYWORDS: SIZE=, UDDTIO
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: No edits in F2008 Corrigendum 1

DISCUSSION:

9.6.2.15p1 [216:32-36] says that when SIZE= specifier is used in a
formatted input statement with explicit format specifications, the
variable specified in the SIZE= specifier is determined by the data
edit descriptors during the input statement.  These rules, however,
did not take into account the following situation where a parent READ
statement with a DT edit descriptor invokes a user-defined DTIO
formatted read subroutine that reads input data using a list-directed or
namelist READ statement.

Consider the following example:

module example
    type A
        integer x(10)

        contains

        procedure :: readArray
        generic :: read(formatted) => readArray
    end type

    contains

    subroutine readArray (dtv, unit, iotype, v_list, iostat, iomsg)
        class(A), intent(inout) :: dtv
        integer, intent(in) :: unit
        character(*), intent(in) :: iotype
        integer, intent(in) :: v_list(:)
        integer, intent(out) :: iostat
        character(*), intent(inout) :: iomsg

        read (unit, fmt=*, iostat=iostat, iomsg=iomsg) dtv%x
    end subroutine
end module

program test
use example
    type(A) :: v
    integer countChar

    open (1, file='example.input', form='formatted')

    read (1, fmt='(DT)', advance='no', size=countChar) v
end program test


Note that there is no data edit descriptor in the UDDTIO subroutine,
readArray, to count the total number of characters transferred during
the child read.


QUESTION:

Is this example intended to be standard conforming?

ANSWER:

Yes, the example is standard-conforming.  The definition of SIZE= in
[10-007 216:31] section 9.6.2.15 does not restrict SIZE= if a child
I/O is present.  The description of how SIZE= works in [219:25]
section 9.6.4.1p22 item (9) clearly indicates that SIZE= should be
set even if child I/O occurs (items (5) and (6)).

KEYWORDS: ENTRY
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: No edits in F2008 Corrigendum 1

QUESTION:

It appears that a hard restriction found in ANSI X3.9-1978
was dropped when we published Fortran 90.  The restriction
on page 15-13 of the FORTRAN 77 standard says

>In a function subprogram, a variable name that is the same
>as an entry name must not appear in any statement that
>precedes the appearance of the entry name in an ENTRY
>statement, except in a type-statement.

so
    FUNCTION S()
    T = 13.0
    ENTRY T()
    END
is not standard-conforming.

The restriction appears to be missing from Fortran 90, 95,
2003.  Should it still be in force ?

ANSWER:

No, for whatever reason, the restriction was dropped a long time ago
and is not in F2008.  The above program does not violate the standard
with the placement of the assignment to T.  [10-007 310:5-8] Section
12.6.2.6 specifies that the results S and T in the above example share
the same memory so S() returns 13.0.  As is, the example is not
standard-conforming since no return value is set for T().

QUESTION:

Does the following program conform to the 2008 Fortran standard?

  subroutine S ( A )
    integer :: A(:,3:)
    integer, parameter :: R = size(lbound(A))
  end subroutine S

Processors disagree.  If the lower bounds of an assumed-shape array
are assumed, LBOUND(A) is not a constant expression according
to item (4)(b)(i) in subclause 7.1.12.  If the lower bounds of an
assumed-shape array are not assumed, LBOUND(A) is a constant
expression in this case, but might be a specification expression in
other cases.

ANSWER:

This program conforms to the 2008 Fortran standard.  The lower bounds
of an assumed-shape array are not assumed.  If a lower bound is not
specified, it has the value 1 -- see the final sentence of the final
paragraph of subclause 5.3.8.3.  If a lower bound is specified, it
must be specified either by a constant expression or a specification
expression.  In the example in the question, the lower bound of the
first dimension is omitted, and therefore has the value 1, while the
lower bound of the second dimension is given by a constant
expression. Therefore, the reference to LBOUND is a constant
expression, and thus the reference to SIZE is a constant expression.

TITLE: When are parameterized sequence types the same type?
KEYWORDS: type parameter, sequence type
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 2

QUESTION:

(1) What does 4.5.2.4 mean by the phrase "have type parameters and
components that agree in order, name, and attributes?"
Does

      REAL A(2*N)

"agree" with

      REAL A(N+N) ?

Does

      REAL A(N*N)

"agree" with

      REAL A(N**2) ?

(2) How complicated can the expressions a processor must
determine are equal or different be?

DISCUSSION:

The Fortran 2008 standard allows sequence types to have type
parameters (4.5.2, 4.5.2.3).  The Fortran 2008 standard also
gives rules for deciding when two entities declared with
reference to derived-type definitions have the same
type (4.5.2.4).  Those rules break down for parameterized
sequence types.

Although the Fortran 2008 standard does not explicitly say
it, the standard assumes that two attributes that include
one or more expressions agree only if the values of those
expressions are the same.  Previous standards used
attributes with expressions that could not be evaluated
statically only in contexts where the processor was not
required to determine if those attributes agreed.  The
inclusion of parameterized sequence types has created
situations where it is necessary for the processor to
determine if such attributes agree.

QUESTION:

(3) Consider the modules

       MODULE M1
         TYPE T(N)
           INTEGER(KIND=4), KIND :: N
           SEQUENCE
           REAL A(2*N)
         END TYPE
         TYPE(T(4)) :: X
       END

       MODULE M2
         TYPE T(N)
           INTEGER(KIND=4), KIND :: N
           SEQUENCE
           REAL A(N+N)
         END TYPE
         TYPE(T(4)) :: Y
       END

Are the variables X and Y in this example of the same
type?

(4) What if the two instances of the type parameter N
in the previous example were not kind type parameters?

(5) Consider the modules

       MODULE M1
         INTERFACE S
           SUBROUTINE S1(X, M)
             TYPE T(N)
               INTEGER, LEN :: N
               SEQUENCE
               REAL A(N+N)
             END TYPE
             TYPE(T(M)) :: X
           END SUBROUTINE
         END INTERFACE
         TYPE T(N)
           INTEGER, LEN :: N
           SEQUENCE
           REAL A(N+N)
         END TYPE
         TYPE(T(2)) :: X
       END

       MODULE M2
         INTERFACE S
           SUBROUTINE S2(X, M)
             TYPE T(N)
               INTEGER, LEN :: N
               SEQUENCE
               REAL A(2*N)
             END TYPE
             TYPE(T(M)) :: X
           END SUBROUTINE
         END INTERFACE
         TYPE T(N)
           INTEGER, LEN :: N
           SEQUENCE
           REAL A(2*N)
         END TYPE
         TYPE(T(2)) :: X
       END

If these two modules are used in the same scoping unit
and there is a CALL of the generic subroutine S in that
scoping unit, does the Fortran 2008 standard
require a conforming processor to detect and report
the conflict with the rules given in 12.4.3.4.5?  It seems
it might or might not  depending
on one's interpretation of item (6) in 1.5.

DISCUSSION:

Some have suggested that two attributes that include
expressions should be said to agree if and only if the
corresponding expressions are equivalent.  One problem
with that notion is that in general the question of
whether two expressions are equivalent is undecidable.
That problem could be circumvented by restricting the
forms of expressions allowed.  For example, the
expressions might be restricted to be polynomials of
one or more variables.  In that case, the problem of
determining equivalence is merely intractable, not
impossible.

Some have suggested that the notion of requiring only
that the values agree should be maintained.  One
consequence of that would be that some constraint
violations that can currently be detected
statically could only be detected dynamically.
For example, consider the program

      MODULE M1
        TYPE T(N)
          INTEGER(KIND=4), LEN :: N
          SEQUENCE
          REAL A(N+N)
        END TYPE
      END

      MODULE M2
        TYPE T(N)
          INTEGER(KIND=4), LEN :: N
          SEQUENCE
          REAL A(N*N)
        END TYPE
      END

      SUBROUTINE S(N)
        USE M1, T1=>T
        USE M2, T2=>T
        TYPE(T1(N)) :: X
        TYPE(T2(N)) :: Y
        Y%A = 0.0
        X = Y
      END

      PROGRAM MAIN
        READ *, N
        CALL S(N)
      END

Under the interpretation requiring equal values, the
question of whether the processor must detect and
report a constraint violation in the assignment X = Y
cannot be determined until the value of N is known.

Another suggestion was that attributes that include
expressions agree if and only if they are textually
equivalent.  That opens up the question of what it
means to say that two expressions are textually
equivalent.  Does whitespace count?  Is "2"
textually equivalent to "02"?  Is "2" textually
equivalent to a named constant "TWO" whose value is
two?

Another suggestion was that two entities declared
with reference to derived-type definitions in different
scoping units should be considered to be different
if either or both of the derived-type definitions
include type parameters.  At least that solution is
easy to specify.

Parameterized sequence types add so little value to the
Fortran language that they cannot be worth the trouble
they cause for the language specification, for
implementors, and, if there are any users, for users.
Therefore, I suggest banning parameterized sequence
types from the language.  Implementations that
currently support parameterized sequence types can
continue to support them due to the permissive nature
of the Fortran standard.

ANSWER:

It was not intended that parameterized derived
types participate in the algorithm for determining when
two types are the same, as given in section 4.5.2.4.
Therefore the answers to the questions are:
Not Applicable, Not Applicable, No, Still No, and No.

To make this effective, edits are supplied which ban
parameterized sequence types from the language.

NUMBER: F03/0124
TITLE: Definition is poorly defined
KEYWORDS: definition
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 1

QUESTION:

Consider the program:

       PROGRAM example1
         TYPE T1
           SEQUENCE
           INTEGER I, J
         END TYPE
         TYPE T2
           SEQUENCE
           INTEGER I, J
         END TYPE
         TYPE(T1) X
         TYPE(T2) Y
         EQUIVALENCE (X, Y)
         X%I = 1
         X%J = 2
         PRINT *, X, Y
       END

Q1. Is this program standard-conforming, and if so, what does it
    print?

According to items (1) and (12) of 16.6.5, the assignment to X%I
causes both X%I and Y%I to become defined.

Similarly, the assignment to X%J causes both X%J and Y%J to become
defined.

Then, according to item (15) of 16.6.5, both X and Y become defined.

However, according to 4.5.2.4, X and Y are types with different names,
and therefore are of different type, thus according to 16.6.6 item (1)
when X becomes defined Y becomes undefined, and vice versa.  This
appears to be a contradiction.

Furthermore, consider

  PROGRAM example2
    TYPE t
      INTEGER a,b
    END TYPE
    TYPE(t),TARGET :: x
    INTEGER,POINTER :: p
    x = t(1,2)
    p => x%a
    p = 33
    PRINT *,x
  END PROGRAM

According to the quoted text, the assignment to P is defining a
variable of type INTEGER, and one that is associated (partially, via
pointer association) with a variable of type T.  That would seem to
make X undefined according to item (1) of 16.6.6.

Q2. Is example2 intended to be standard-conforming?

Finally, consider

  MODULE ugly1
    TYPE t1
      INTEGER a,b
    END TYPE
    INTEGER w,z
    TYPE(t1) x
    COMMON/c/w,x,z
  END MODULE
  MODULE ugly2
    TYPE t2
      INTEGER c,d
    END TYPE
    TYPE(t2) y1,y2
    COMMON/c/y1,y2
  END MODULE
  BLOCK DATA
    COMON/c/i(4)
    DATA i/1,2,3,4/
  END BLOCK DATA
  PROGRAM example3
    USE ugly1
    USE ugly2
    ! At this point c is 1,2,3,4.
    y1 = t2(66,-6)
    PRINT *,w ! Is this ok?
    w = 0
    PRINT *,y1 ! And is this ok?
  END PROGRAM

This is similar to example1, except that we are defining a whole
variable of sequence type at once, not by partial definition.

Q3. Is example3 standard-conforming?


ANSWER:

A1. The program was intended to be standard-conforming.
    An edit is supplied to remove the apparent contradiction.

    The program should print something like " 1 2 1 2".

A2. Yes, example2 is intended to be standard-conforming.
    An edit is supplied to remove the problem.

A3. Yes, example3 is intended to be standard-conforming.
    An edit is supplied to remove the problem.

DISCUSSION:

The only interesting case of variable definition causing an associated
variable to become undefined is using the old FORTRAN 77 data types;
all the other intrinsic types are not permitted to be associated with
variables of different type.

We only need to get the scalar intrinsic case right, as the array and
derived type cases then follow automatically from the definitions in
16.6.1.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[455:4-10] Replace 16.6.6 item (1) entirely:
  "(1) When a scalar variable of intrinsic type becomes defined, all
       totally associated variables of different type become
       undefined.
       When a double precision scalar variable becomes defined, all
       partially associated scalar variables become undefined.
       When a scalar variable becomes defined, all partially
       associated double precision scalar variables become undefined."

KEYWORDS: NAMELIST
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: No edits in F2008 Corrigendum 1

QUESTION:

Was it intended to disallow vendors to provide namelist output that
includes a subobject designator followed by a value?

ANSWER:

Yes.  The processor is required to produce output in the form
specified by 10.11.4.3 "Namelist output records".

10.11.4.3 paragraph 2 states
  "The name of each namelist group object list item is placed in the
   output record followed by an equals and a list of values of the
   namelist group object list item."

This unambiguously states that each namelist group object list item
(these are the ones listed in NAMELIST statements) have their names
placed in the output record followed by an equals sign and the list
of their values.  Subobject designators do not appear in NAMELIST
statements.

TITLE: Functions returning procedure pointers
KEYWORDS: procedure pointer
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 3

QUESTION:

(1) Is a function permitted to return a procedure pointer?
    Much of the language talks about the function result variable,
    but a procedure pointer is not a variable.  For example, 2.2.3
    says [12:16]
       "The VARIABLE that returns the value of a function is called
        the RESULT VARIABLE."
    (emphasis mine); which indicates that the value of a function is
    returned in a variable.

(2) Where may a function reference that returns a procedure pointer
    appear?  In particular,
    (a) as a <selector> in a SELECT TYPE or an ASSOCIATE statement;
    (b) within parentheses as a primary;
    (c) as the argument to an intrinsic inquiry function such as
        KIND or LEN.

(3) [12:18-19] says
      "a subroutine may be used to change the program state by
       changing the values of any of the data objects accessible
       to the subroutine".
    A procedure pointer is not a data object, so is this meant to
    imply that a subroutine is not permitted to change the state of a
    procedure pointer?  Similar text for functions appears in the same
    paragraph.

ANSWER:

(1) Yes, a function is permitted to return a procedure pointer; the
     text calling this a variable is in error.  Edits are supplied to
     correct these mistakes.

(2) It was intended that a function reference that returns a
     procedure pointer only be permitted as an argument to the
     ASSOCIATED and NULL intrinsic functions and in places where an
     ordinary procedure name would be acceptable.  Parentheses around
     a pointer act to dereference the pointer and return a copy of the
     value: this action is inapplicable to procedures. Thus the
     answers to the specific sub-questions are No, No, and No again.
     Clarifying edits are provided.

(3) No, this implication is not intended.  A clarifying edit is
    provided.

QUESTION:

At [10-007r1:111:19-23 5.6p5] it says

        A namelist group object shall either be accessed by use or host
        association or shall have its type, type parameters, and shape
        specified by previous specification statements or the procedure
        heading in the same scoping unit or by the implicit typing

Because "type parameters, and shape" appears, is the following
conforming?

  real, allocatable :: A(:)
  real, pointer :: B(:)
  character(len=:), allocatable :: C
  namelist /N/ A, B, C

DISCUSSION:

The wording of 5.6p5 is a result of not completely finishing the

TITLE: Is a disassociated pointer allowed as an actual DIM argument?
KEYWORDS: DIM argument
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 1

QUESTION:

Several intrinsic functions, such as ANY, have a DIM argument, with
the rank of the result depending upon whether it is present.  There is
a prohibition against the actual argument being an optional dummy
argument, but not against it being a disassociated pointer or
deallocated allocatable.  Is the following program standard
conforming, and if so what does it print?

  program DIM_Arg
    integer, pointer :: Dim => NULL()
    logical :: Mask(2,2) = &
      & reshape( (/ .true., .false, .false, .true. /), (/ 2, 2 /) )
    print *, shape( any(mask,dim) )
  end program DIM_Arg

The description worked until we allowed a disassociated pointer or
unallocated allocatable variable that is associated with a nonpointer
nonallocatable optional argument to be interpreted not to be present.

ANSWER:

It was intended that this program not conform.

It was an oversight that disassociated pointer and unallocated
allocatable actual arguments were not prohibited to correspond to DIM
dummy arguments for these intrinsic functions.

Edits are provided to clarify this.  These functions were intended to
behave similarly to MAXLOC et al, where this issue does not arise.

TITLE: Is TARGET argument of ASSOCIATED a pointer or nonpointer dummy?
KEYWORDS: TARGET argument of ASSOCIATED
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 2

QUESTION:

Is the following conforming, and if so what does it print?

  program TARGET_Arg
    integer, pointer :: Pointer
    integer, pointer :: Target => NULL()
    integer, target :: AnotherTarget
    pointer => anotherTarget
    print *, Associated(pointer,target)
  end program TARGET_Arg

DISCUSSION:

Subclause 13.7 stipulates that descriptions of arguments of intrinsic
procedures apply to actual arguments.  This leaves open the question
whether the TARGET dummy argument of ASSOCIATED is a pointer or not.

If not a pointer, being optional, it is considered by subclause
12.5.2.12 to be absent if the corresponding actual argument is
disassociated.

Thereby, the result value of ASSOCIATED (by Case(i) of the result
value clause) is true.

If the TARGET dummy argument is a pointer, the result value of
ASSOCIATED (by Case (iv) of the result value clause) is false.

ANSWER:

The Result Value paragraph of 13.7.16 ASSOCIATED only makes sense if
the references to TARGET are talking about the actual argument.
Therefore the program is standard conforming and prints F.

An edit is supplied to remind the reader.

TITLE: optional arguments and ASSOCIATED
KEYWORDS: TARGET argument of ASSOCIATED
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Subsumed by F08/0004 in F2008 Corrigendum 1

QUESTION:

If the actual argument associated with the dummy argument TARGET
of the intrinsic function ASSOCIATED is a disassociated pointer,
is the dummy argument TARGET to be treated as an optional
argument that is not present or as an argument that is present?

ANSWER:

The dummy argument TARGET should be treated as an argument that
is present.

DISCUSSION:

This problem was created by the Fortran 2008 extension that
declares that a dummy argument is not present if it corresponds
to an actual argument that is a disassociated pointer
[12.5.2.12p1, 299:15-17].

Among the solutions that have been suggested are

     (1) removing the extension,

     (2) restricting the extension to apply only to user-defined
         functions,

     (3) adding an exception to the extension for the intrinsic
         function ASSOCIATED,

     (4) changing the specification of ASSOCIATED in
         [17.7.16, 330:7-42] to specify two signatures.

As attractive as the first two solutions are, I initially
favored solution (3) as it caused the least change to the
language as defined in recent drafts.  I proposed to add text
to Section 12.5.2.12 specifying the exception.  Over time, I
changed my mind; I now favor solution (4).

I initially favored solution (3) over solution (4) because
solution (4) does not treat the dummy argument TARGET as not
present when the corresponding actual argument is an optional
argument that is not present.  That functionality is in
Fortran 2003, and I did not think it should be removed.  The
more I thought about the issue, the more I was convinced that
that functionality is useless except for programs written for
test suites.  I am now convinced that removing that
functionality improves the language by making it possible for
a processor to treat use of that functionality as the error
it almost certainly is.

TITLE: Generic resolution, intrinsic procedures, and host association
KEYWORDS: intrinsic, generic, host association
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: No edits in F2008 Corrigendum 1

QUESTION:

The specifications of some intrinsic functions and subroutines
explicitly ban certain combinations of arguments, even though those
combinations are included in the title and the argument portion of the
specification of the function or subroutine.  Examples include CMPLX
and RANDOM_SEED.  Other requirements include being a valid KIND type
parameter value (e.g. INT) or having having character length 1
(e.g. ICHAR).

Consider the program fragment

  PROGRAM p
    INTERFACE cmplx
      LOGICAL FUNCTION mycmplx(a,b)
        COMPLEX a
        REAL b
      END
    END INTERFACE
    INTERFACE random_seed
      SUBROUTINE my_random_seed(get,put,size)
        INTEGER,OPTIONAL :: get(:),put(:),size
      END SUBROUTINE
    END INTERFACE
    INTERFACE int
      INTEGER FUNCTION myint(i,j)
      END
    END INTERFACE
    COMPLEX :: z = (1,2)
    REAL :: r = 3
    CALL check
  CONTAINS
    SUBROUTINE check
      INTRINSIC int,cmplx,random_seed
      PRINT *,cmplx(z,r)            ! Reference (1).
      CALL random_seed(GET=a,PUT=b) ! Reference (2).
      PRINT *,int(3,17)             ! Reference (3).
    END SUBROUTINE
  END PROGRAM

Are the procedure references (1), (2), and (3) invalid references to
the intrinsic procedures CMPLX, RANDOM_SEED, and INT, or are they
valid references to the user procedures mycmplx, my_random_seed, and
myint respectively?

ANSWER:

Reference (1) is a valid reference to the user procedure.

Both references (2) and (3) are invalid references to the intrinsic
procedures; however, no constraints are violated so a standard-
conforming processor may do anything, including treating them as
references to the user procedures.

DISCUSSION:

12.5.5.2 paragraph 4 explains that the reference is to the intrinsic
procedure if it is "consistent with the interface of that intrinsic
procedure".  The interface to an intrinsic procedure consists of its
name, characteristics, and dummy argument names.  The characteristics
of a procedure as defined by 12.4.1 do not include arbitrary
restrictions such as those for RANDOM_SEED which are on argument
presence (an execution time concept).  Nor are requirements such as an
actual argument being required to be a constant expression part of an
interface.

In the case of CMPLX however, there is no specific version whose
interface has an X argument of type COMPLEX and any Y argument.
13.7.36 describes this by "If X is of type complex, no actual argument
shall correspond to Y".  Therefore the reference to CMPLX with such
arguments is not consistent with the intrinsic.

TITLE: Can zero have more than one bit sequence representation?
KEYWORDS: zero, bits
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: No edits in F2008 Corrigendum 1

QUESTIONS:

Question (1):
Some processors provide two internal representations for the
integer value zero.  The ones' complement representation of signed
integers and the signed-magnitude representation of signed
integers both provide two representations for zero.  Must a
processor for such a machine use a bit sequence consisting of all
zero bits to represent zero, regardless of the internal
representation of zero?

Question (2):
The Fortran 2008 standard [13.3.1, 317:9] states

    The interpretation of a negative integer as a
    sequence of bits is processor dependent.

Could a standard-conforming processor interpret all negative
integers as a sequence of all zero bits?

ANSWERS:

Answer to question (1): Yes.  The standard does not allow for more
than one bit representation of zero.

Answer to question (2): No.  The standard specifies that the integer
value of a string of all zero bits is zero.  The standard does not
specify the integer values for bit strings when the leftmost bit is
one.  A processor could interpret all negative integers as a sequence
of a one followed by all zero bits.  It would not be a useful bit
representation but it is not disallowed.

STATUS: No edits in F2008 Corrigendum 2

QUESTION:

Section 13.7.1, page 325, lines 10-12 states

    If an infinite result is returned, the flag IEEE_OVERFLOW
    or IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO shall signal; if a NaN result is
    returned, the flag IEEE_INVALID shall signal.

Question (1):
The Fortran 2008 standard does not require a standard-conforming
processor to support IEEE_INVALID [14.3p8, 404:15].  If a
processor does not support IEEE_INVALID, is it required to signal
IEEE_INVALID when a NaN result is returned?

Question (2):
IEC 60559 requires the result of SQRT(+inf) to be +inf without
overflow being signaled.  IEC 60559 requires SQRT(qNaN), where qNaN
is a quiet NaN, not to signal an invalid operand exception.  Does
Fortran 2008 require SQRT(QNaN) to signal IEEE_INVALID?

ANSWERS:

A1. No, if the processor does not support IEEE_INVALID, it cannot
    signal IEEE_INVALID.  An edit is provided to clarify this.

A2. No, the standard does not specify the behavior of SQRT on qNaN.

DISCUSSION:

Chapter 14 of F2008 does not define an IEEE_ABS intrinsic as a
separate IEEE version of ABS and the example given in Section
14.11.3p7 [409:26] requires that ABS comply with the function
abs specified in the optional portion of IEC 60559.  We infer
that the standard intended for the ABS intrinsic to be compliant

Yes, the Fortran standard requires the intrinsic function ABS

      End Subroutine

The topic is how many times each final procedure is called on return
from each subroutine?

For s10, clearly f10 is called once.

For s11(a), clearly f11 is called once, and f10 is not called.

For s11(b), the standard (4.5.6.3 para 5) seems to indicate that f10
  is called.  That would not make much sense - the value of the
  structure constructor is part of the value of the array constructor,
  so calling f10 would mean that that array element would be finalized
  twice (once by f11, once by f10, in no set order).

For s11(c), the standard standard appears to say that f11 is called
  three times, once for each (nested) array constructor.  Seeing as
  how nesting array constructors is a syntactic thing that makes zero
  difference to the value - the value of [[anything]] is identical in
  every respect to the value of [anything] - this does not seem to
  make sense.

For s20, clearly f20 is called once, and f10 is called afterwards to
  finalize the parent component.

For s21(d), clearly f21 is called once, followed by f11 to finalize the
  parent components.  f20 and f10 are not called.

For s21(e), f21 and f11 are called as in s21(d); the standard implies
  that f20 and then f10 are called, but that does not make sense, the
  same as case s11(b).

For s21(f), the situation seems to be the same as s21(e); the wanted
  f21 and f11, and (unordered) the unwanted f20 and f10.

For s21(g), f21 and f11 are called as in s21(d); the standard implies
  that f10 is called to finalize t1(3) and also that f20 and then f10
  are called to finalize t2(t1=t1(3),4).  This makes even less sense
  than before, since the t1 part of the array constructor element is
  going to be finalized 3 times just because of the syntax we used.

For s21(h), f21 and f11 are called as in s21(d) to finalize the whole
  array constructor value; the standard also implies that f20 and then
  f10 are called on all of the 5000000 even-numbered elements.
  Requiring the processor to keep track of all those elements to be
  finalized on return from s21 seems rather severe.

Furthermore, an object that has been finalized is not permitted to be
referenced or defined.  That makes the multiple finalization
interpretation even more hard to understand.

Philosophically, finalization should finalize objects exactly once.

There seem to be three possibilities here.
(1) The finalizers are called multiple times, but on the separate
    entities created by the constructors.  For example s21(g), that is
    t1(3) is created as object X, when t2(...) is evaluated a new
    separate object Y is created and that value is copied into it, and
    when [...] is evaluated a third object Z is created with the value
    of Y copied into it; afterwards, we effectively have
       call f10(X); call f20(Y); call f21(Z); call f11(Z%t1)
    For s21(h) that burden is going to be extreme because the standard
    says these are "finalized after execution of the innermost
    executable construct containing the reference" (and it is possible
    to detect this in a conforming program); changing that to
    "finalized after the value has been used" would be better if
    slightly vague.
(2) These entities are indeed finalized multiple times, just as the
    standard implies.
(3) Constructors that are merely providing part of the value of a
    bigger constructor are not finalized.
(4) Constructors should never be finalized in themselves, this was
    just a design error that inevitably leads to multiple or
    unwanted finalization.

Which is the correct approach?

ANSWER:
Approach 4.  Constructors don't do anything that needs finalization.

The topic is how many times each final procedure is called on return
from each subroutine?

Clearly, the final procedures are not called on return from the calls
not marked with an asterisk.

For the ones marked with an asterisk, the situation is less clear.
The standard says that a structure constructor or array constructor
is finalized
  "[if] an executable construct references [it]"
(4.5.6.3p5).
However, the term "reference" is not defined for these entities; the
closest would seem to be
  "appearance of a data object designator in a context requiring
   its value at that point during execution"
which would appear on the face of it to mean that these entities are
finalized since the constructor appears in a context requiring its
value.

Possible interpretations might be
(a) Yes, the entities are required to be finalized (so the relevant
    final procedure is executed).
(b) The text in 4.5.6.3p5 was not intended to be applied to
    constants (the standard is defective).
(c) The processor can optionally evaluate an alternative expression
    with the same value, viz an named constant, so it is processor
    dependent whether the finalizer is called.

Option (a) seems inconsistent with named constants otherwise being
equivalent to their constant expression.

Option (c) argument could be equally applied to nonconstant
constructors, so this would make all finalization of constructed
values optional.  That would seem inconsistent with the purpose
of finalization.

QUESTION:

Consider the program:

          Final :: f11

The topic is how 4.5.6.3 paragraphs 1 and 9 interact.
The relevant texts are, respectively:
  "When an allocatable entity is deallocated, it is finalized."
  "When an intrinsic assignment statement is executed, the variable
   is finalized after evaluation of <expr> and before the definition
   of the variable."

In the assignment marked (*1), paragraph 9 says that the variable (X)
is finalized, i.e.
  CALL F11(X)
is executed.  However, this would be invalid, because an unallocated
allocatable would be associated with a nonallocatable nonoptional
dummy argument.

In the assignment marked (*2), paragraph 9 again says that the
variable is finalized - after evaluation of <expr> but before the
definition of the variable.  However, because the shapes of the
variable and the expression differ, definition of the variable
involves deallocating the variable (and allocating it with the correct
shape).  Paragraph 1 says that deallocating the variable finalizes it,
so that means that F11 should be called twice for the variable.  This
is problematic since a finalized entity is not permitted to be
referenced or defined by a final subroutine.

In the assignment marked (*3), the variable and expression have the
same shape so the variable will not be deallocated, so according to
paragraph 9 it should be finalized once.

Q1. Are all the assignment statements standard-conforming?

Q2. How many times is the variable finalized (i.e. how many times is
    the final subroutine called) in each standard-conforming case?

ANSWER:

A1. Yes, all the assignment statements are intended to be standard
    conforming.  Edits are supplied to correct the problem in (*1).

A2. The variable is finalized exactly once, except when it was
    unallocated (and then it is not finalized).  Edits are supplied to
    correct the problem in (*2).

Consider the program:

        x( [1,4,9] ) = t1(1.5)
        Print *,x
      End Program

According to 6.5.3.2.2 Vector subscript,
  "An array section with a vector subscript shall not be ...
   argument associated with a dummy array that is defined or
   redefined ..."

Therefore the program above is not standard-conforming; however it
seems that deleting the assignment statement marked (*) would make the
program standard-conforming.

This seems to make final subroutines not useful when vector subscripts
are involved; either the finalization doesn't do anything to the
object in which case the vector subscript is allowed, or it does do
something (like deallocation) in which case the vector subscript is
disallowed.

Also, since passing vector-subscripted objects as actual arguments is
almost certainly going to pass a copy (and what's more a copy that
won't be copied back), this results in something other than the actual
entity being finalized - and this is possibly visible if pointers and
targets are involved.

Finally, these apparent violations of the standard are probably not
going to be detected on many processors, resulting in silent wrong
answers.  At least if vector subscripted sections being finalized were
rejected at compile time the user would stand a chance of avoiding
these problems.

Q. Is this analysis correct, and is this situation deliberate?

ANSWER:

A. The analysis is correct.  This should have been alleviated by
   allowing elemental procedures to modify vector-subscripted
   arguments.  An edit is supplied.

QUESTION:

    "The mapping may be to a derived type that is inaccessible in the
     local scope if the derived type is accessible to the host scope."

But what if the derived type is not accessible to the host scope?

Consider the module:

  module m
    implicit type(t) (a-z)
    type t
      real x
    end type

    subroutine s(x)
      type t

    end subroutine
  end module

In inner, the mapping is not to a derived type that is accessible to
the host scope.

Is this module standard-conforming?

Yes.  The statement apparently giving permission is in error: no
permission needs to be given here, it simply follows from the other

QUESTION:

According to 6.5.3.3.2 [124] Vector subscript,
  "An array section with a vector subscript shall not be ...

How can we predict the future?

And even if we could, it implies that it would be ok for the dummy
array to be undefined (because it only forbids becoming defined).

As it happens, 12.5.2.4p18 [295:3-4] already says it is not
definable, so already covers being defined and redefined - and also
becoming undefined, and also prevents not just INTENT(OUT) or INOUT

Consider the following elemental subroutine

  ELEMENTAL SUBROUTINE test_add(a,b)
    REAL,INTENT(IN) :: a,b
    REAL c
    c = a+b
  END SUBROUTINE

and the following reference:

  REAL x(10),y
  LOGICAL toobig
  ...
  CALL IEEE_SET_FLAG(IEEE_OVERFLOW,.FALSE.)
  CALL test_add(x,y)
  CALL IEEE_GET_FLAG(IEEE_OVERFLOW,toobig)

The subroutine test_add does not do anything useful other than to
set the IEEE_OVERFLOW flag when x+y would overflow.

Is this program fragment standard-conforming?

12.8.3 says
  "In a reference to an elemental subroutine, either all actual
   arguments shall be scalar, or all actual arguments corresponding to
   INTENT (OUT) and INTENT (INOUT) dummy arguments shall be arrays of
   the same shape and the remaining actual arguments shall be
   conformable with them."

Obviously, it is not the case that all actual arguments are scalar.
However, there not being any actual arguments corresponding to
INTENT(OUT) or INTENT(INOUT) dummy arguments, it is not possible for
the remaining actual arguments (x and y) to be conformable with them.

Is this an oversight?  (If not, it seems a very clumsy way of
requiring elemental subroutines to have an INTENT(OUT) or
INTENT(INOUT) argument, and one that doesn't work if they are only
referenced with scalar arguments.)

ANSWER:

Yes, the program fragment is intended to be standard-conforming.

QUESTION:

Consider
  REAL :: array(1000),value
  COMPLEX :: carray(1000),cvalue
  LOGICAL :: ilarray(1000),ilvalue
  ...
  PRINT *,FINDLOC(array,value)
  PRINT *,FINDLOC(carray,cvalue)
  PRINT *,FINDLOC(ilarray,ilvalue)

Are any of the references to FINDLOC standard-conforming?

13.7.61 requires of the VALUE argument that it
   "shall be ... in type conformance with ARRAY, as specified in Table
   7.2 for relational intrinsic operations 7.1.5.5.2).".

Yes, there is an unpaired parenthesis.

More to the point:
 (a) Table 7.2 is in 7.1.5.1 not in 7.1.5.5.2;
 (b) there is no table about type conformance in 7.1.5.5.2,
 (c) for type logical, the comparison is allegedly done by .EQV.,
     but that is not a relational operator.

It could be argued that the reference to 7.1.5.5.2 is just misleading,
and reading the rest of the sentence we should indeed use Table 7.2,
with the conformance as specified for the relational operators.  That
would make the first reference to FINDLOC conforming.

The second reference to FINDLOC is more problematic, because some
relational operators permit complex arguments (e.g. .EQ.) and some do
not (.LE.).  This makes it ambiguous as to whether or not it is
conforming.

The third reference to FINDLOC is the most problematic, because no
relational operators permit logical arguments.  Later on, FINDLOC
says it uses .EQV. for logical comparison, but .EQV. is a logical
operator not a relational operator, so in any case VALUE cannot
satisfy the rules in Table 7.2.

ANSWER:

These were all intended to be standard-conforming.  Edits are supplied
to correct the requirement.

Note that p does not have any deferred type parameters, so is not
prohibited from being a disassociated pointer in a reference to

TITLE: DO CONCURRENT and file i/o

QUESTION:

The standard states [178:15-16] that
  "An input/output statement shall not write data to a file record or
   position in one iteration and read from the same record or position
   in a different iteration."

In the loop

  DO CONCURRENT (i=1:2)
    IF (i==1) READ(17,REC=100) x    ! (a)
    IF (i==2) WRITE(17,REC=100) y   ! (b)
  END DO

The input/output statement at (a) only reads data from the file, it
does not write it, and thus does not fall foul of this restriction.
Similar reasoning shows that the input/output statement at (b) also
obeys this restriction.

Is this fragment intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

No, the example is not intended to be standard-conforming.  An edit is
supplied to make the requirement less ambiguous.

TITLE: DO CONCURRENT and POINTER
KEYWORDS: DO CONCURRENT, POINTER
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 1

QUESTION:

Consider the following example:

  REAL,POINTER :: x(:)
  REAL y(4)
  DO CONCURRENT (i=1:4)
    IF (IAND(i,1)==1) THEN
      ALLOCATE(x(i))
      x = 3           ! Note: defines x, does not reference x.
    ELSE
      y(i) = SUM(x)   ! (*) Note: references x.
      DEALLOCATE(x)
    END IF
  END DO

This is clearly not conforming, as it violates the requirement in
[178:8-9 8.1.6.7p1 second bullet]:

  "A pointer that is referenced in an iteration either shall be
   previously pointer associated during that iteration, or shall not
   have its pointer association changed during any iteration."

However, consider example 2, identical except for replacing the (*)
statement with:

      y(i) = SIZE(x)   ! (*) Note: SIZE does not reference x.

That statement does not reference x (see definition of reference at
1.3.120) and so does not violate the requirement.

An even simpler example which does not violate the requirement but
which appears problematic is

  POINTER p
  NULLIFY(p)
  DO CONCURRENT(i=1:2)
    IF (i==1) ALLOCATE(p)
    IF (i==2) PRINT *,ASSOCIATED(p)
  END DO

A third example which does not violate the requirement but again
appears to be problematic is

  PROCEDURE(),POINTER :: p,q
  EXTERNAL a,b
  p => a
  DO CONCURRENT(i=1:2)
    IF (i==1) p => b
    IF (i==2) q => p    ! (*1)
  END DO
  CALL q                ! (*2)

Note that (*1) does not reference p, but (*2) does reference q.
The pointer q is only set by one iteration, so no problem there.

Were these examples intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

No, the examples were not intended to be standard-conforming.  An edit
is supplied to correct the requirement.

Comment: We don't need to require "pointer associated" for
         "reference", that is always required for references.
         What we need to require is for the pointer association
         status to be established.

QUESTION:

Consider
  IMPURE ELEMENTAL SUBROUTINE swap1(a,b)
    REAL,INTENT(INOUT) :: a,b
    c = a
    a = b
    b = c
  END SUBROUTINE
  IMPURE ELEMENTAL SUBROUTINE swap2(a,b)

  ...
  REAL x,y(10)

  CALL swap1(x,y)   ! (a)
  CALL swap2(x,y)   ! (b)

The rules for arguments of elemental subroutines means that CALL (a)
is not standard-conforming.  However, since there are no rules
requiring declaration of INTENT (that being for PURE only), CALL (b)
is apparently standard-conforming.

QUESTION:

Consider the following example:

  REAL,POINTER :: x(:)
  REAL y(4)
  ...
  DO CONCURRENT (i=1:4)
    IF (IAND(i,1)==1) ALLOCATE(x(i),STAT=j)
    ...
    y(i) = SUM(x)
    IF (IAND(i,1)==1) DEALLOCATE(x,STAT=j)
  END DO

This is clearly not conforming, as it violates the requirement in
[178:5-6 8.1.6.7p1 second bullet]:

  "A pointer that is referenced in an iteration either shall be
   previously pointer associated during that iteration, or shall not
   have its pointer association changed during any iteration."

However, consider example 2, identical except for replacing the first
statement with:

  REAL,ALLOCATABLE :: x(:)

This satisfies the first restriction for allocatables - if
allocated by more than one iteration, it shall be subsequently
deallocated by that iteration.  The second restriction for
allocatables - that it not be referenced by a different iteration -
only applies to allocatables allocated/deallocated by a single
iteration, not by multiple iterations.

Together with use of STAT= and a previously allocated array, this
allows cross-iteration dependencies.

Q1. Was this intended to be standard-conforming?

Consider example 3

  REAL,ALLOCATABLE :: x(:)
  ALLOCATE(x(10))
  DO CONCURRENT(i=1:2)
    IF (i==1) THEN
      DEALLOCATE(x)
    ELSE IF (ALLOCATED(x)) THEN
      PRINT *,'Iteration 2 happened first'
    ELSE
      PRINT *,'Iteration 1 happened first'
    END IF
  END DO

This does not fall foul of the restrictions because using ALLOCATED
does not "reference" x.

Q2. Was this intended to be standard-conforming?

Consider example 4

  REAL,ALLOCATABLE :: x(:)
  ...
  ALLOCATE(x(999))
  DO CONCURRENT (i=1:3)
    IF (i>1) ALLOCATE(x(i))
    X = 3
    DEALLOCATE(x)
  END DO

Again, the reference and DEALLOCATE in an iteration that does not
ALLOCATE it is permitted because it is ALLOCATEd in more than one
iteration.  This would not have been permitted if x had been a
pointer.

Q3. Was this intended to be standard-conforming?

The second allocatable restriction says [178:13-14]:

  "An allocatable object that is ... deallocated in only one iteration
   shall not be deallocated ... in a different iteration."

This does not achieve anything, since the "deallocated ... in a
different iteration" means that it is deallocated in more than one
iteration in the first place.

Q4. What is the meaning of this restriction?

ANSWER:

No, the examples were not intended to be standard-conforming.
The restriction is faulty; an edit is supplied to correct it.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[178:13-14] In 8.1.6.7p1, ante-penultimate bullet point,

A2. Yes, this should not have been a bullet point as it does not

  "If format control encounters the rightmost parenthesis of a

QUESTION:

Consider
  MODULE m
    TYPE t
      ...
    CONTAINS
      FINAL f
    END TYPE
    INTEGER :: fcount = 0
  CONTAINS
    SUBROUTINE f(x)
      TYPE(t),INTENT(INOUT) :: x
      ...
      fcount = fcount + 1
    END SUBROUTINE
    PURE SUBROUTINE zap(x)                ! (1)
      TYPE(t),INTENT(OUT) :: x
    END SUBROUTINE
    PURE SUBROUTINE bad(y)
      TYPE(t),INTENT(INOUT) :: y
      CALL zap(y)                         ! (2)
    END SUBROUTINE
  END MODULE

Clearly, even though subroutine zap is pure, invoking it causes impure
final subroutine f to be called and so therefore it cannot be invoked
in any context that requires it to be pure.

Thus the call marked (2) is invalid.

The question is whether the subroutine definition itself (marked (1))
is standard-conforming.  If finalization of INTENT(OUT) arguments is
considered to be done by the called procedure, then the subroutine
definition is not standard-conforming.  If finalization of INTENT(OUT)
arguments is done by the caller, the subroutine definition might be
standard-conforming.

It would certainly seem a bit strange to be able to define a PURE
procedure that cannot be invoked anywhere purity is required.

DISCUSSION:

Although the phrase "When a procedure is invoked" sounds like
finalization occurs in the caller of a procedure and not in the called
procedure, being PURE or having a finalizable INTENT(OUT) dummy
argument are not grounds for an explicit interface to be required.

This would appear to require, as a matter of practicality, that the
processor performs the finalization of the actual argument on entry to
the called procedure.  I.e., that the impure final subroutine will in
actuality be called from the pure procedure.

ANSWER:

Allowing a PURE procedure to cause invocation of impure final
procedures in this way was inadvertant.  An edit is supplied to
clarify that any INTENT(OUT) dummy arguments of a PURE procedure must
not have a relevant impure FINAL procedure.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

  "C1277a An INTENT(OUT) argument of a pure procedure shall not be
          such that finalization of the actual argument would
          reference an impure procedure."
{In some other constraints we use "procedure that is not pure", but
 "impure procedure" is a simpler way of saying the same thing.}

QUESTION:

Consider
  MODULE m
    TYPE t
      REAL c
    CONTAINS
      FINAL f
    END TYPE
    INTEGER :: fcount = 0
  CONTAINS
    SUBROUTINE f(x)
      TYPE(t),INTENT(INOUT) :: x
      x%c = 0

    END SUBROUTINE
    PURE TYPE(t) FUNCTION g(a)
      REAL,INTENT(IN) :: a
      g%c = a
    END FUNCTION
  END MODULE

Even though this function is PURE, invoking it will inevitably result
in the execution of the impure FINAL subroutine f.  Thus, it cannot be
used within another PURE procedure or from within a DO CONCURRENT
loop, though it can be used from within a FORALL (because the
finalizations only get done on termination of the outermost FORALL).

Some other cases of impure finalization are prohibited by C1284, but
not this because it does not occur "in" the procedure.

Should an impurely-finalizable function result be allowed for a pure
function?

ANSWER:

No, this should not be allowed.  An edit is supplied to correct this
oversight in the requirements for pure procedures.

QUESTION:

Consider
  MODULE m
    TYPE root

    CONTAINS
      FINAL pf
      PROCEDURE asgn
      GENERIC :: ASSIGNMENT(=) => asgn
    END TYPE
    TYPE,EXTENDS(root) :: t
    CONTAINS
      FINAL f
    END TYPE
    INTEGER :: fcount = 0
  CONTAINS
    PURE SUBROUTINE pf(x)
      TYPE(root),INTENT(INOUT) :: x
      x%c = 0
    END SUBROUTINE
    SUBROUTINE f(x)
      TYPE(t),INTENT(INOUT) :: x
      fcount = fcount + 1
    END SUBROUTINE
    PURE SUBROUTINE asgn(a,b)
      CLASS(root),INTENT(OUT) :: a
      CLASS(root),INTENT(IN) :: b
      a%c = b%c

    SUBROUTINE process(array,scalar)
      CLASS(root) array(:),scalar
      FORALL (i=1:SIZE(array)) array(i) = scalar
    END SUBROUTINE
  END MODULE

  TYPE(root) w,x(100)
  TYPE(t) y(100),z
  ...
  CALL process(x,w) ! (1)
  CALL process(y,z) ! (2)

The procedure reference at (1) will execute process with the dynamic
types of its dummy arguments being TYPE(root); the finalization of the
array elements caused by the defined assignment in the FORALL
statement will execute only the pure procedure pf, so all is well.

However, the procedure reference at (2) will execute process with the
dynamic types of its dummy arguments being TYPE(t); the finalization
of the array elements in this case will additionally call the impure
final procedure f, so all is not well.

However, this cannot be detected at compilation time.  But constraint
C1284 [313] requires diagnosis of this error.

Surely some mistake?  Either the constraint cannot be a constraint
(which would be bad, since a design goal of pure procedures is that
violation of purity can be detected at compile time), or polymorphic
arguments to pure procedures need to be restricted in some way.

Q1. Should polymorphic INTENT(OUT) arguments to pure procedures be
    allowed?

Note that finalization can also occur via DEALLOCATE of an ALLOCATABLE
or POINTER dummy argument that is not INTENT(IN).

Q2. Should ALLOCATABLE and POINTER dummy arguments of pure procedures
    be allowed to be polymorphic and not INTENT(IN)?  Or should
    deallocation of any polymorphic subobject of a dummy argument
    simply be disallowed?

Note that problematic (as in undecidable at compile time) finalization
can also occur via DEALLOCATE of a non-polymorphic component of a
non-INTENT(IN) argument if it has a subobject that is an ALLOCATABLE
polymorphic component.

Furthermore, such deallocation can occur via intrinsic assignment.

Q3. Should this be constrained in some way?

ANSWER:

A1. This interaction between polymorphism, finalization, and purity is
    inadvertent.  An INTENT(OUT) argument of a pure procedure should
    not be allowed to be polymorphic; an edit is supplied to correct
    this mistake.

A2. Yes, deallocation of any polymorphic entity should be forbidden in
    a pure procedure.  An edit is supplied to correct this.

A3. Any statement that might result in a deallocation that is
    forbidden should not be allowed in a pure procedure.  An edit is
    supplied, with a note.

  CALL zap2(b)    ! (3)
  CALL zap2(bb)   ! (4)

The question is which CALL statements result in finalization and thus
deallocation of the various vec components.

If the finalization of an INTENT(OUT) argument is considered to happen
"on invocation" in the caller, then presumably the CALL statements
marked (1) and (4) will result in deallocation.

On the other hand, if the finalization of an INTENT(OUT) argument is
considered to be done in the called procedure, then arguably it is the
CALL statements marked (1) and (2) instead that will result in
deallocation.

In either case some clarification would seem to be useful.

Q. Which statements result in deallocation of the vec components?

ANSWER:

A. The finalization is considered to occur in the called procedure,
   so the statements marked (1) and (2) will result in deallocation of
   the vec components.

Note that this is consistent with the answer to interp F08/0031
(10-181r1).

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[76:24] At the end of 4.5.6.3 paragraph 8, append new sentence
  "The finalization caused by INTENT(OUT) is considered to occur
   within the invoked procedure; so for elemental procedures, an
   INTENT(OUT) argument will be finalized only if a scalar or
   elemental final subroutine is available, regardless of the rank
   of the actual argument."

TITLE: Maximum value for SHIFT argument to SHIFTL and SHIFTR
KEYWORDS: SHIFTL, SHIFTR, BIT_SIZE
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: No edits in F2008 Corrigendum 1

QUESTION:

A significant part of the justification for the addition of the
redundant SHIFTL and SHIFTR intrinsic functions was that in the case
of a nonconstant SHIFT argument, the generated code needed to test the
shift direction and that such tests were inefficient.

However, it is not uncommon for the actual hardware shift instructions
to only shift the argument modulo the bit size, for either 32-bit or
64-bit shifts, or both.  Since SHIFT is allowed to be equal to the bit
size, this means that tests still need to be done to check for this
case.

Since being able to generate the value zero by shifting an arbitrary
nonzero argument completely, applying the feature justification leads
one to surmise that perhaps SHIFT should have been limited to
BIT_SIZE-1 instead of BIT_SIZE.

Q. Should the maximum value of the SHIFT argument to the SHIFTL and
   SHIFTR intrinsics be BIT_SIZE or BIT_SIZE - 1?

Note: A similar argument does not apply quite so straightforwardly to
      SHIFTA, since it provides new functionality.

ANSWER:

A. Although allowing SHIFTL and SHIFTR by BIT_SIZE provides little
   useful functionality, this is allowed for consistency with ISHFT.

TITLE: Are pointless restrictions on DIM arguments intended?
KEYWORDS: DIM argument, optional, intrinsic reduction function
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: No edits in F2008 Corrigendum 2

DISCUSSION:

Some of the reduction functions have two forms, one with a DIM
argument and one without; the DIM argument is not optional.  IALL is
an example.  Other reduction functions have a DIM argument that is
optional.  COUNT is an example.  The actual argument corresponding to
the DIM actual argument is prohibited from being an optional dummy
argument in both cases.  The reason in the case of an optional DIM
argument is so that the processor can determine the rank of the
result.  In the case of those with two forms, there is no problem for
the processor to determine the rank, so the prohibition against the
corresponding actual argument being an optional dummy argument is
pointless.  There is already a prohibition against it being an absent
optional dummy argument in 12.5.2.12p3(4) [299].

Consider, for example

  subroutine S ( ARRAY, DIM )
    integer, intent(in) :: ARRAY(:,:)
    integer, intent(in), optional :: DIM
    if ( present(dim) ) then
      print *, iall(array,dim)
    else
      print *, iall(array)
    end if
  end subroutine S

This subroutine clearly does not conform, but a processor would have
no difficulty determining the rank of the result of IALL(ARRAY,DIM).

QUESTION:

(1) Was the pointless restriction intentional, or was it an oversight
that it did not get removed in the two-form case when MAXLOC etc. were
added?

(2) Is it necessary to continue the pointless restriction?

ANSWER:

(1) Yes, this was intentional.  These could have been removed in
    Fortran 95, Fortran 2003, or Fortran 2008, but there was no
    request for removal.

(2) No, but it is inappropriate to provide a new feature that would
    need many edits via the defect processing system.  If this feature
    is desired it can be added in a future revision of the language.

(The user-defined function no_duplicates returns .TRUE. if and only if
 its argument has no duplicate values.)

6.5.3.3.2 "Vector subscript" paragraph 3 [124] says:
  "If a vector subscript has two or more elements with the same value,
   an array section with that vector subscript shall not appear in a
   variable definition context (16.6.7)."

In the execution of zap from the CALL statement, the array section
z(i) has a vector subscript with two elements with the same value, and
appears in a variable definition context, in violation of the stated
requirement.

Q. Is this program fragment standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

Yes, this program is standard-conforming.  The quoted requirement is
poorly worded; an edit is supplied to correct it.

TITLE:  MOVE_ALLOC for coarrays
KEYWORDS: intrinsic, allocation
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 2

QUESTION:

Was it intended that MOVE_ALLOC be applicable to coarrays?

ANSWER:

Yes.  A call to MOVE_ALLOC on coarrays might involve the deallocation
of a coarray, therefore MOVE_ALLOC needs to be an image control
statement.

Also, the coranks of FROM and TO need to be the same.

Edits are supplied to correct this.

DISCUSSION:

It might appear that C541 which says
  "An entity with the INTENT(OUT) attribute shall not be an
   allocatable coarray ..."
might prohibit MOVE_ALLOC from operating on coarrays; however, this
constraint applies to user-defined procedure not to intrinsic
procedures.

An edit is supplied to clarify C541.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[97:13] In 5.3.10 INTENT attribute, C541,
  Change "An entity"
  to "A dummy argument of a nonintrinsic procedure".

[372:18] In 13.7.118p3 MOVE_ALLOC, FROM argument,
         "type and rank" -> "type, rank, and corank".
{Edit is not necessary, but makes it more readable.}

  Insert new paragraph immediately before "Example:"
    "When a reference to MOVE_ALLOC is executed for which the FROM
     argument is a coarray, there is an implicit synchronization of
     all images.  On each image, execution of the segment (8.5.2)
     following the CALL statement is delayed until all other images
     have executed the same statement the same number of times."

NUMBER: F08/0042
TITLE: SOURCE= questions
KEYWORDS: ALLOCATE, SOURCE=
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 2

QUESTION:

Consider the program
  PROGRAM example1
  REAL,ALLOCATABLE :: x(:),y(:)
  ALLOCATE(x(10),y(10),SOURCE=3.14159265)
  PRINT *,x,y
  END

This program does not conform to Fortran 2003 due to constraint C631
which stated
  "If SOURCE= appears, ... <allocation-list> shall contain only one
   <allocate-object> ...".

The corresponding constraint in Fortran 2008, C638 [127], is missing
this requirement, so apparently the program is now syntactically
correct.

However, the Introduction to the Fortran 2008 standard does not
mention this as a new feature.

Furthermore, 6.7.1.1 paragraph 4 [127] begins
  "If <allocate-object> is a coarray, <source-expr> shall not have a
   dynamic type of ..."
which implies that there is only one <allocate-object> for a
<source-expr> (at least when the <allocate-object> is a coarray).

Similarly, the wording of constraint C639 implies a one-to-one
correspondence between <allocate-object> and <source-expr>.

Q1. Is the omission of the single allocation requirement of Fortran
    2003 an oversight? (i.e. is example1 non-conforming?).

Also, consider the program
  PROGRAM example2
  REAL,ALLOCATABLE :: x[:]
  ALLOCATE(x[*])
  x = 3
  END

The ALLOCATE statement appears not to conform to Fortran 2008 because
of 6.7.1.1 paragraph 4; since <source-expr> does not appear, it cannot
satisfy any condition about its dynamic type.

Q2. Is an ALLOCATE statement for a coarray required to have SOURCE=?
    (i.e. is example2 non-conforming?).

Also, if multiple allocations with SOURCE= are permitted,
consider the program
  PROGRAM example3
    INTEGER,ALLOCATABLE :: x,y
    ALLOCATE(x,y,SOURCE=f())
    PRINT *,x,y
  CONTAINS
    INTEGER FUNCTION f()
      INTEGER,SAVE :: n = 1
      f = n
      n = n + 1
    END FUNCTION
  END PROGRAM

The execution semantics of SOURCE= in 6.7.1.2 paragraph 7 do not state
whether the <source-expr> is evaluated once per statement or once per
allocation.  If the processor evaluates per statement execution,
something like " 1 1" will be printed, but if it evaluates it per
allocation, something like " 1 2" could be printed.

Q3. How many times may <source-expr> be evaluated in an ALLOCATE
    statement with multiple allocations?

Also, consider the program
  PROGRAM example4
    REAL,ALLOCATABLE :: x(:)
    ALLOCATE(x,SOURCE=[0.5,1.5])
    PRINT *,x
  END PROGRAM

The Introduction implies that this program should be standard-
conforming, but it violates constraint C633, which begins
  "(R631) If <allocate-object> is an array either <allocate-shape-
   spec-list> shall appear or <source-expr> shall appear ..."
The requirements of C633 are not satisfied because R631 is
<allocation> and <source-expr> does not appear in R631.

Q4. Is example4 intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

The answer to question 1 is No.
This feature was deliberately added to the Fortran 2008 standard.
Edits are supplied to correct its exposition.

The answer to question 2 is No.
An edit is supplied to correct paragraph 4 of 6.7.1.1.

The answer to question 3 is once.
An edit is supplied to clarify paragraph 7 of 6.7.1.2.

The answer to question 4 is Yes.
An edit is supplied to correct constraint C633.

TITLE:  Executing a type-bound procedure on a coindexed object
KEYWORDS: coarrays, polymorphism
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: No edits in F2008 Corrigendum 2

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

  module m
    type :: foo
      integer :: i = 0
    contains
      procedure, pass :: op
    end type
  contains
    subroutine op(this, i)
      class(foo) :: this
      this%i = i
    end subroutine
  end module m
  program p
    use m
    class(foo), allocatable :: o_foo[:]
    integer :: me
    allocate(foo :: o_foo[*])

    me = this_image()
    if (me == 1) then
      call o_foo[2]%op(1)             ! Type-bound call.
    end if
    sync all
    if (me == 2) write(*,*) o_foo%i
  end program p

This program is not standard-conforming, as it violates one of the
requirements of 12.5.2.4p2 [293], viz
  "If the actual argument is a polymorphic coindexed object,
   the dummy argument shall not be polymorphic."

However, if the type-bound call were replaced by

  SELECT TYPE(o_foo)
  TYPE IS (foo)
    CALL o_foo[2]%op(1)
  END SELECT

appears to be standard-conforming.

The example program appears to be harmless, so the requirement appears
to be unnecessary.  It is conjectured that the requirement is
misworded and should instead be
  "If the actual argument is a polymorphic subobject of a coindexed
   object, the dummy argument shall not be polymorphic."?

Q1. Is this requirement intentional?

Furthermore, constraint C1229 says of a <data-ref> that is the object
for a type-bound procedure reference, that it
  "shall not be a polymorphic subobject of a coindexed object";
however, C617 already prohibits any <data-ref> from being a
polymorphic subobject of a coindexed object except as the subject of
a type parameter inquiry or as the actual argument in an intrinsic
inquiry function reference, so C1229 appears to be completely
redundant.

Q2. Is constraint C1229 redundant?

ANSWER:

A1. The requirement is intentional.

A2. Yes, constraint C1229 is redundant.
    It will be removed in a future revision.

TITLE: VALUE attribute restrictions
KEYWORDS: VALUE
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 1

QUESTION:

Consider the program unit

  SUBROUTINE s(x,y,n)
    REAL,VALUE :: x(:)
    CHARACTER(n),VALUE :: y
    DO i=2,SIZE(x)
      x(i) = x(i) + x(i-1)
    END DO
    PRINT *,y,x
  END SUBROUTINE

This is not valid in Fortran 2003 as it violates constraint C527
  "If the VALUE attribute is specified, the ... DIMENSION
   ... attribute shall not be specified."
and also violates constraint C528
  "If the VALUE attribute is specified, the length type parameter
   values shall be omitted or specified by initialization
   expressions."

The corresponding constraint to F2003/C527 for Fortran 2008, C558
[101], does not prohibit the DIMENSION attribute.  There does not
appear to be any constraint in F2008 corresponding to F2003/C528.
Therefore this program unit is apparently now syntactically correct.

However, the Introduction to the Fortran 2008 standard does not
mention these as new features.

Is the omission of these requirements an oversight?

No, these are deliberate additions to the language.  An edit is

DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 1

QUESTION:

Interpretation F03/0119, which became part of the Fortran 2008
standard, added as constraint the requirement of an elemental function
that its result variable
  "shall not have a type parameter that is defined by an expression
   that is not a constant expression".

This makes a number of valid Fortran 95 programs invalid, for no
apparent technical reason.  Moreover, no text was added to clause 1 to
indicate this incompatibility with Fortran 95.

Here are several examples of non-problematic Fortran 95 elemental
procedures that are apparently not valid Fortran 2008.

  MODULE ex1
    INTEGER :: mylen
  CONTAINS
    ELEMENTAL CHARACTER(mylen) FUNCTION f(a)
      INTEGER,INTENT(IN) :: a
      f = REPEAT(CHAR(a),mylen)

  END MODULE

  ELEMENTAL FUNCTION ex2(a,b)
    CHARACTER(*),INTENT(IN) :: a,b
    CHARACTER(LEN(a)+LEN(b)) :: ex2
    ex2 = a//b
  END FUNCTION

  MODULE ex3
    INTEGER,ALLOCATABLE :: x(:)

    PURE FUNCTION gcd(a)
      INTEGER :: gcd

      CHARACTER(gcd([x,LEN(y),LEN(z)])) :: f
      f = ...
    END FUNCTION
  END MODULE

Was this incompatibility with Fortran 95 an oversight?

Yes, this was an oversight; requiring the type parameter values to be
constant is unnecessarily onerous.  An edit is supplied to correct
this defect in the standard.

TITLE: Ordering requirements on definition of specification functions
KEYWORDS: Specification expressions, specification functions
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 1
REFERENCE: F95/0030

BACKGROUND (can be skipped without significant loss):

F95/0030 asked to consider the following program unit.

      MODULE MOD
        INTERFACE INT
          MODULE PROCEDURE F1, F2
        END INTERFACE
      CONTAINS
        INTEGER PURE FUNCTION F1(I)
          INTEGER :: A(INT(1_4)), B(INT(1_2))    ! A(1), B(19)
          INTEGER, PARAMETER :: KIND = SIZE(A)   ! KIND == 1
          INTEGER(KIND), INTENT(IN) :: I

          F1 = 17
        END FUNCTION F1

        INTEGER PURE FUNCTION F2(J)
          INTEGER :: C(INT(2_4))                 ! C(2)
          INTEGER, PARAMETER :: KIND = SIZE(C)   ! KIND == 2
          INTEGER(KIND), INTENT(IN) :: J

          F2 = 19
        END FUNCTION F2
      END MODULE MOD

In processing the references to "INT(1_4)" and "INT(1_2)" in F1, the
processor needs to determine whether the references are to the
intrinsic function, INT, or to one of the specific procedures, F1 or
F2.  Determining that requires the processor to have determined the
kind type parameter of the dummy argument J, of F2.  In turn, that
requires the processor to determine whether the reference to
"INT(2_4)" is a reference to the intrinsic function, INT, or to one
of the specific procedures, F1 or F2.  Determining that requires the
processor to determine the kind type parameter of the dummy argument
I, which requires it to determine that "INT(1_4)" in F1 was a
reference to the intrinsic function INT.

After all this is determined, the processor can determine that the
reference to "INT(1_2)" in the declaration of B in F1 is a reference
to the specification function F2.

According to F95/7.1.6.1 [97-007r2:94:38-41],

     "If an initialization expression includes a reference to an
      inquiry function for a type parameter or an array bound of an
      object specified in the same <specification-part>, the type
      parameter or array bound shall be specified in a prior
      specification of the <specification-part>.  The prior
      specification may be to the left of the inquiry function in the
      same statement."

or F03/7.1.7   [04-007:30-33]

     "If an initialization expression includes a specification inquiry
      that depends on a type parameter or an array bound of an entity

      or array bound shall be specified in a prior specification of
      the <specification-part>. The prior specification may be to the
      left of the specification inquiry in the same statement, but
      shall not be within the same <entity-decl>."

or F08/7.1.12p2 [10-007r1:152:22-25]

     "If a constant expression includes a specification inquiry that

      <specification-part>. The prior specification may be to the
      left of the specification inquiry in the same statement, but
      shall not be within the same <entity-decl>."

According to F95/7.1.6.2 [97-007r2:96:27-37],

     "A variable in a specification expression shall have its type and
      type parameters, if any, specified by a previous declaration in
      the same scoping unit, or by the implicit typing rules in effect
      for the scoping unit, or by host or use association.  If a
      variable in a specification expression is typed by the implicit
      typing rules, its appearance in any subsequent type declaration
      statement shall confirm the implied type and type parameters.

     "If a specification expression includes a reference to an inquiry
      function for a type parameter or an array bound of an entity

      the left of the inquiry function reference in the same
      statement.  If a specification expression includes a reference
      to the value of an element of an array specified in the same
      <specification-part>, the array shall be completely specified
      in prior declarations."

or F03/7.1.6 [126:9-14]

     "A variable in a specification expression shall have its type
      and type parameters, if any, specified by a previous
      declaration in the same scoping unit, by the implicit typing

or F08/7.1.11p8+9 [10-007r1:151:3-12]

     "A variable in a specification expression shall have its type

      expression includes a reference to the value of an element of
      an array specified in the same <specification-part>, the array
      shall be completely specified in prior declarations."

The rules regarding references to variables in specification
expressions and initialization expressions require a strict
left-to-right, top-to-bottom ordering between specification and
inquiry.  Specification functions appear to be unrestricted in this
respect.

Interp F95/0030 added the following new paragraph immediately
before F03/Note 7.11 [04-007:127:33+]

  If an initialization expression in a module includes a reference to
  a generic, that generic shall have no specific procedures defined
  in the module subsequent to the initialization expression.

And the following new paragraph immediately before F03/Note 7.10
[04-007:126:19+]:

  If a specification expression in a module includes a reference to
  a generic, that generic shall have no specific procedures defined
  in the module subsequent to the specification expression.

QUESTION:

The new paragraphs introduced into F03 by F95/0030, at
[04-007:127:33+] and [04-007:126:19+], were changed in F08.  The
additional caveat "or submodule" was harmlessly introduced in four
places by TR 19767.  Paper 07-190r3 introduced "the
<specification-part> of" in F08/7.1.12p3 [10-007r1:152:26-28]

  If a constant expression in the <specification-part> of a module
  or submodule includes a reference to a generic entity, that
  generic entity shall have no specific procedures defined in the
  module or submodule subsequent to the constant expression.

and F08/7.1.11p9 [10-007r1:151:13-15]

  If a specification expression in the <specification-part> of a
  module or submodule includes a reference to a generic entity,
  that generic entity shall have no specific procedures defined in
  the module or submodule subsequent to the specification
  expression.

Because of the changes introduced in F08 by 07-190r3, the
paragraphs no longer address the question of interpretation
request F95/0030, resulting in the example in the F95/0030 being
standard conforming, contrary to the ANSWER to F95/0030.

In light of F08 allowing generic interfaces to have specific
procedures that are internal procedures, the following example
illustrates a deeper problem than was illustrated in F95/0030:

      SUBROUTINE SUB
        INTERFACE INT
          PROCEDURE F1, F2
        END INTERFACE
      CONTAINS
        INTEGER PURE FUNCTION F1(I)
          INTEGER :: A(INT(1_4)), B(INT(1_2))    ! A(1), B(19)
          INTEGER, PARAMETER :: KIND = SIZE(A)   ! KIND == 1
          INTEGER(KIND), INTENT(IN) :: I

          F1 = 17
        END FUNCTION F1

        INTEGER PURE FUNCTION F2(J)
          INTEGER :: C(INT(2_4))                 ! C(2)
          INTEGER, PARAMETER :: KIND = SIZE(C)   ! KIND == 2
          INTEGER(KIND), INTENT(IN) :: J

          F2 = 19
        END FUNCTION F2
      END SUBROUTINE SUB

Assuming that the processor supports integers with kind type
parameters of 1, 2 and 4, was it the intent of the committee that this
program unit example should be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

No, it is clear from the answer to interpretation request F95/0030
that it is not the intent that the above program unit be standard
conforming.  The required complexity of implementation is not
justified.  The standard (as amended by corrigenda) briefly had
prohibitions against it, but they were inadvertently removed during
development of Fortran 2008.  The edits below correct this.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

Replace F08/7.1.11p9 [10-007r1:151:13-15] by

  "A generic entity referenced in a specification expression in the
   <specification-part> of a scoping unit shall have no specific
   procedures defined in that scoping unit, or its host scoping unit,
   subsequent to the specification expression."

Replace F08/7.1.12p3 [10-007r1:152:26-28] by

  "A generic entity referenced in a constant expression in the
   <specification-part> of a scoping unit shall have no specific
   procedures defined in that scoping unit, or its host scoping unit,
   subsequent to the constant expression."

QUESTION:

Consider

  PURE FUNCTION F(X)
    REAL,VALUE :: X
    F = X**2
  END FUNCTION

This subprogram does not conform to the Fortran 2003 standard, but
appears to conform to the Fortran 2008 standard, as constraints C1276
and C1277 (in Fortran 2008) have been modified to remove the previous
requirement for an INTENT specification in the case of arguments that
have the VALUE attribute.

However, this is not mentioned as a change in the Introduction.

Was this change inadvertent?

ANSWER:

No, this change was deliberate.  An edit is provided to clarify.

QUESTION:

Consider the program

  MODULE example1_m1
    TYPE t1
    CONTAINS
      PROCEDURE,PRIVATE,NOPASS :: p ! (1).
    END TYPE
  CONTAINS
    SUBROUTINE p
      PRINT *,'p'
    END SUBROUTINE
    SUBROUTINE do_p(x)
      CLASS(t1) x
      CALL x%p

  MODULE example1_m2

    CALL do_p(y) ! (4): I expect this to print 'p'.
    CALL x%p(13) ! (5): I expect this to print 'p2 13'.
  END PROGRAM

Question 1: does type-bound procedure overriding take account of
accessibility; that is, is the type-bound procedure statement at (2)
(a) a valid new type-bound procedure definition, or
(b) an invalid overriding of the definition at (1)?

Question 2: If the answer to question 1 was "yes" (a), and the example
is standard-conforming, are the expectations at (3), (4), and (5)
correct?

For the next question, consider the following program fragment:

  MODULE example2_m1
    TYPE,ABSTRACT :: t1
    CONTAINS
      PROCEDURE(p),PRIVATE,DEFERRED,NOPASS :: hidden ! (6).
    END TYPE
  CONTAINS
    SUBROUTINE p
      PRINT *,'p'
    END SUBROUTINE
  END MODULE
  MODULE example2_m2
    USE example2_m1
    TYPE,EXTENDS(t1) :: t2
    CONTAINS
      PROCEDURE,NOPASS :: hidden => exposed ! (7).
    END TYPE
  CONTAINS
    SUBROUTINE exposed
      PRINT *,'exposed'
    END SUBROUTINE
  END MODULE

Question 3: If the answer to question 1 was "yes" (a), then the
definition of type t2 would seem to be defective in that (7) must be
defining a new type-bound procedure, and not overriding the type-bound
procedure defined at (6), and that therefore t2 still has a deferred
type-bound procedure.  That would mean that an abstract type with a
private deferred type-bound procedure could not be extended outside of
the module in which it is defined: is that correct?

ANSWER:

Q1. Yes, type-bound procedure overriding does take account of
    accessibility.  This means that the type-bound procedure statement
    at (2) is (a) a valid new type-bound procedure definition.

    Subclause 4.5.7.3p1 says [78:4-6]
      "If a specific type-bound procedure specified in a type
       definition has the same binding name as a type-bound procedure
       from the parent type then [it] overrides the [inherited one]."
    If the inherited type-bound procedure is private, and the
    extending type definition is not in the same module, then the
    inherited type-bound procedure is not accessible by that name,
    so the condition "has the same binding name" cannot be satisfied.

    This wording is very confusing, so an edit is supplied to clarify
    the intent.

Q2. Yes, the comments at (3), (4), and (5) are accurate.

Q3. Yes, an abstract type with a private deferred type-bound procedure
    cannot be extended outside the defining module, because it is
    otherwise impossible to override the private type-bound procedure.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[78:4] In 4.5.7.3p1,
       change "as a type-bound"
       to "as an accessible type-bound".

BACKGROUND:

There is a specification in 12.4.3.4 [283] of the properties that
cause two dummy arguments to be distinguishable.

C1214 [286] specifies that two procedures within the scope of a
<defined-io-generic-spec> shall be distinguishable.

There is no specification of the properties that cause two procedures
to be distinguishable.

12.4.3.4.5p5 [286:38] specifies that a "generic invocation applies
to...."

QUESTIONS:

(1) Shouldn't the requirement in C1214 be that the \cf{dtv} arguments
are distinguishable?

(2) Shouldn't 12.4.3.4.5p5  specify that a "generic nvocation is
    consistent with...?"

(1) Yes.


(2) Yes.

QUESTION:

Consider the program

  SUBROUTINE Fred() BIND(C,NAME='Nurke')
    PRINT *,'ok'
  END SUBROUTINE
  SUBROUTINE S(dummy)
    INTERFACE
      SUBROUTINE dummy() BIND(C)
      END SUBROUTINE
    END INTERFACE
    CALL dummy
  END SUBROUTINE
  PROGRAM example1
    EXTERNAL Fred,S
    CALL S(Fred)
  END PROGRAM

According to 12.4.2.2, an explicit interface is only ever required in
a scope where a procedure is referenced.  The main program does not
reference Fred, so this appears to be conforming.  It appears that
no processors accept this example...

However, the very similar program minus the BIND(C) specifications

  SUBROUTINE Freddy(x)
    LOGICAL,OPTIONAL :: x
    IF (PRESENT(x)) PRINT *,'ok'
  END SUBROUTINE
  SUBROUTINE SUB(dummy)
    INTERFACE
      SUBROUTINE dummy(x)

      END SUBROUTINE
    END INTERFACE
    CALL dummy(.TRUE.)
  END SUBROUTINE
  PROGRAM example2
    EXTERNAL Freddy,SUB
    CALL SUB(Freddy)
  END PROGRAM

but with a different reason for requiring an explicit interface, is
also apparently valid in Fortran 2003/2008 but is not valid in
Fortran 90 or Fortran 95, because they require the explicit interface
without the condition of the procedure being referenced in that
scope.

This feature (viz only require the explicit interface where it is
referenced) was added by paper 02-144, which makes no mention of it
being a new feature.

Was this a deliberate new feature?

ANSWER:

No, this was a mistake in 02-144 and thus in Fortran 2003 and 2008.
An edit is provided to correct the mistake.

EDITS to 10-007r1 (after corrigendum 1):

[24:11+] 1.6.2 Compatibility, at the end, insert new paragraph

   "Fortran 2003 required an explicit interface only for a procedure

    actual argument.  This part of ISO/IEC 1539 requires an explicit
    interface for a procedure under the conditions listed in 12.4.2.2,
    regardless of whether the procedure is referenced in the scope."

[279:19] In 12.4.2.2p1, replace
   "A procedure ... and"
with
   "Within the scope of a procedure identifier, the procedure shall

STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 2

QUESTION:

Q1. Gw.d editing for a real value that is in the range (0.1,10**d) and
    is not near an integer power of 10 uses F editing to produce
    exactly a value with d significant digits.  For values in this
    range that are near an integer power of 10, is it intended that F
    editing be used to produce a value with d significant digits?

The rules in 10.7.5.2.2 usually have this effect, but the following
examples illustrate exceptions for rounding UP and to ZERO.
     print "(ru,g11.2)", -9.95
     print "(rz,g11.2)", -9.95
When rounded to two significant digits these are both equal to -9.9,
however following through the rules in the standard it says to use
F7.0 format which will give the result -9. (only one significant
digit).  For positive values, rounding DOWN and to ZERO
     print "(rd,g11.2)", 9.95
     print "(rz,g11.2)", 9.95
both give the result 9.9 according to the rules in the standard.

Q2. Is Gw.d editing intended to use F editing when that produces d
    significant digits?

It usually achieves this, but for
     print "(ru,0p,g11.2)", -99.5
the standard requires 0PE11.2 editing to be used, which gives
     -0.99E+02
even though F7.2 editing can represent it as -99.

Similarly for
     print "(ru,0p,g11.2)", 99.
the standard requires 0PE11.2 editing to be used, which gives
0.99E+02, even though it is representable in F7.2 format as 99.

Q3. COMPATIBLE and NEAREST modes of rounding differ only when the two
    nearest representable values are equidistant from the given
    value.  The similarity appears not to be represented in the second
    table.  What is meant by "if the higher value is even"?

If by "even" we mean the last digit is even, then since we are talking
about a mantissa which is close to 10, COMPATIBLE and NEAREST would
have the same effect.

Q4. The table has no entry for PROCESSOR_DEFINED rounding; since there
    is no value specified for r, it is impossible to interpret the
    table, which seems to indicate that it would not be standard
    conforming to use G editing with PROCESSOR_DEFINED.  How does the
    PROCESSOR_DEFINED I/O rounding mode affect G editing?

Q5. According to 10.7.2.3.7 paragraphs 3 and 4, the effect of NEAREST
    is processor dependent unless IEEE rounding on conversions is
    supported.  How does this affect G editing?

Q6. Consider
        PRINT '(5(1X,1PG9.0))', 0.0, 0.04, 0.06, 0.4, 0.6
    noting that these values are strictly monotonic increasing.
    The standard appears to say that the output should be
        0.E+00  4.E-02  0.      0.      6.E-01
    which is decidedly not monotonic increasing.
    Is this intentional?

ANSWER:

A1. Yes, it is intended to produce output with d significant digits.
    The algorithm for choosing the output form for some I/O rounding
    modes is defective.  An edit is provided to replace this

TITLE: Non-polymorphic ALLOCATE with polymorphic SOURCE=
KEYWORDS: ALLOCATE, polymorphic, SOURCE=.
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 2

QUESTION:

Consider
  Program m195_m1
    Type t
      Real c
    End Type
    Type,Extends(t) :: t2
      Real d
    End Type
    Class(t),Allocatable :: x
    Type(t),Allocatable :: y
    Allocate(x,Source=t2(1.5,-1.5))
    Allocate(y,Source=x)               ! (*)
    ...
  End Program

Is the second ALLOCATE statement (marked *) standard-conforming?

The only requirement is that Y be type-compatible with X; they both
have the same declared type so this is true.

However, the very similar
  Allocate(y,Source=t2(1.2,-1.5))
would not be conforming because Y is not type-compatible with the
structure constructor, and
  y = x
would also not be conforming (the dynamic types being different).

However, the standard says that
  "the value of [y] becomes that of [x]"
which is clearly impossible.

Since the standard fails to establish an interpretation one might
conclude that the example is not conforming.  However, the similar
situation with the dynamic types being the same but with non-deferred
length type parameters being different is explicitly stated to be
conforming (and to raise an error condition), perhaps this was also
intended to raise an error condition.

It is also possible that the intent was to use the value of the
declared type part in this case, as happens for pointer assignment.

What is the interpretation of this ALLOCATE statement?

ANSWER:

The statement was intended to be conforming and to use the declared
type part of the source-expr only.  An edit is supplied to clarify.

EDIT:

[128:24] In 6.7.1.2p7, before "On successful", insert
  "If an <allocate-object> is not polymorphic and the <source-expr> is
   polymorphic with a dynamic type that differs from its declared
   type, the value provided for that <allocate-object> is the ancestor
   component of the <source-expr> that has the type of the
   <allocate-object>; otherwise, the value provided is the value of
   the <source-expr>."
[128:25-26] Replace "that of <source-expr>" with "the value provided",
            twice.

Clearly everything except statement (2) is standard-conforming.

The statement marked (2) violates the requirement in 12.5.2.5
paragraph 2 for the actual argument to be polymorphic when the dummy
argument is a polymorphic pointer.  However, apart from that
requirement, statement (2) is functionally equivalent to the sequence
(0) then (1), so the "auto-targetting" feature does not need this
requirement.

Was this imposition of this requirement (which is needed when both the
actual and the dummy are pointers) an oversight in this case?

Note that similar considerations apply to
   CHARACTER(100),TARGET :: actual
   CHARACTER(:),POINTER,INTENT(IN) :: dummy
in that the pointer assignment would be valid, but the requirements
in 12.5.2.5 paragraph 5 are not met.

ANSWER:

Yes, the imposition of these requirements to the auto-targetting
feature was an oversight.  Edits are supplied to correct this.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[295:16-17] In 12.5.2.5, Replace paragraph  with
  "The requirements in this subclause apply to an actual argument

{Except for paragraph 4, all these requirements are unnecessary when
 auto-targetting is happening.  Note that 12.5.2.5p6 is moot because
 a coindexed object is not permitted in auto-targetting as it is not
 a valid target in a pointer assignment (C725).}

[296:4-5] Delete paragraph 12.5.2.5p4 and reinsert twice,
          once at [296:12+] as a new paragraph after 12.5.2.6p3, and

QUESTION:

Consider

  Program m5

    Call s
  Contains
    Subroutine s
      Procedure(Real),Pointer :: p
      Print *,g()
      p => f                           ! (1)

      Print *,p()
    End Subroutine
  End Program
  Function f()
    f = 1
  End Function
  Function g()
    g = 2
  End Function

is this program standard-conforming?

On the face of it, both (1) and (2) violate constraint C729, which
only allows an external procedure
  "that is accessed by use or host association and is referenced in
   the scoping unit as a procedure or that has the EXTERNAL
   attribute".
The function f is accessed by host association but is not referenced
in the scoping unit as a procedure, whereas the function g is
referenced in the scoping unit as a procedure but is not accessed by
use or host association.

Furthermore, consider

  Program m5a
    Real,External :: f,p
    Pointer p
    p => f                       ! (3)
    Print *,p()
  End Program
  ! function f as above.

Is this conforming?  The constraint has a single clause for external
procedures with no commas but with a disjunction and a conjunction,
therefore it is ambiguous whether it means
   "accessed by use or host association" AND
    ("is referenced in the scoping unit as a procedure" OR
     "has the external attribute")
or whether it means
   ("accessed by use or host association" AND
    "is referenced in the scoping unit as a procedure") OR
     "has the external attribute")

Since the standard does not unambiguously give an interpretation of
this program it seems that statement (3) is also not conforming.

Which of these three procedure pointer assignment statements were
intended to be conforming?

DISCUSSION:

The wording of this constraint was determined by Interp F03/0138,
which intended to change it to

  "C727 (R742) A <procedure-name> shall be the name of a module or
        dummy procedure, a specific intrinsic function listed in 13.6
        and not marked with a bullet ($\bullet$), a procedure pointer,
        or an external procedure that is accessed by use or host
        association, referenced in the scoping unit as a procedure, or
        that has the EXTERNAL attribute."

but a last-minute "editorial" change at the WG5 ballot stage made it

  "C727 (R742) A <procedure-name> shall be the name of a module or
        dummy procedure, a specific intrinsic function listed in 13.6
        and not marked with a bullet ($\bullet$), a procedure pointer,
        or an external procedure that is accessed by use or host
        association and is referenced in the scoping unit as a
        procedure, or that has the EXTERNAL attribute."

instead, and the comma got lost in between there and Fortran 2008.
Despite supposedly being an editorial change, the WG5 wording has
different technical results.

According to the original wording of the interp, all three examples
above were intended to be allowed.

ANSWER:

All three pointer assignment statements were intended to be valid.
An edit is supplied to correct the error in the standard.

[158:33-159:2] In 7.2.2.2, C729,

WG5/N1830 has [p104, 5.4.7, parag. 2]

  If a nonpointer object has default initialization, it shall not
  appear in a <data-stmt-object-list>.

and [p89, 5.2.3, parag. 1]

  Explicit initialization alternatively may be specified in a DATA
  statement unless the variable is of a derived type for which default
  initialization is specified. [...] A variable, or part of a
  variable, shall not be explicitly initialized more than once in a
  program.

and [p70, 4.5.4.6, parag. 6]

  Explicit initialization in a type declaration statement (5.2)
  overrides default initialization


ANSWER:

It was intended that the data statement not be conforming.

5.4.7p2 was carefully worded to use "shall not appear" rather than
"shall not be the <data-stmt-object>".

The intention was that an object be initialized entirely in a type
declaration statement, or that only those parts of it having default
initialization be initialized.  It was considered to be a burden on
processors to be required to initialize some parts of a structure
using default initialization, and other parts of it explicitly.

this will do F editing, and according to the table that means
  F2.4,4(' ')

ANSWER:

10.7.2.3.2 says
  "the field occupies w positions, the fractional part of which
   consists of d digits"
and this does not make sense if w<d.  Therefore, according to the
first sentence of 1.5 Conformance, the program is not standard
conforming.

There are therefore no requirements on the processor for this
program, and it may produce either output, or even a runtime error.

None.

QUESTION:

Assuming the processor supports environment variables, consider

  Program m197_m1
    Call Get_Environment_Variable(Name='HOME',Length=n,Status=istatus)
    Print *,istatus
    If (istatus==0) Print *,n
  End Program

If the environment variable HOME does not exist,
this program is obviously standard-conforming and prints the value 1
(STATUS paragraph of 13.7.67).

If the environment variable HOME does exist but has "no value",
this program is obviously standard-conforming and prints the value 0
(STATUS paragraph) and then prints the value 0 (LENGTH paragraph).

Aside: Indeed, if a VALUE argument is supplied, it seems that "no
       value" is the same as "zero-length value" in that no difference
       between them is discernable in a standard-conforming program.

"Inconvenience 1":
If the environment variable HOME does exist, and has a value whose
length is zero, the program appears to be not standard-conforming as
no interpretation is established: there is no specification of the
value to be assigned to the STATUS argument.  This relies on there
being a difference between "no value" and "zero-length value".

"Inconvenience 2":
If the environment variable HOME does exist, and has a value whose
length is not zero, the program is definitely not standard-conforming
as no interpretation is established w.r.t. the STATUS argument.

Thus, even though VALUE is optional, it would seem that it is not
permitted to omit it except when enquiring the existence of an
environment variable that does not exist.

Was it really intended to be impossible to enquire the existence and
length of the environment variable without attempting to fetch it?

ANSWER:

No, this was not intended.  An edit is supplied to correct this.

EDIT:

[351:18] After "either has no value" change "or" to a comma.
         After "assigned to VALUE,"
         insert "or the VALUE argument is not present,".

TITLE: Passing arrays of extended type objects
KEYWORDS: assumed-size arrays, extended type
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 2

QUESTION:

Can an assumed-size array of extended type be passed as an actual
argument to a nonpolymorphic dummy array whose type is the parent
type of the extended type?

Clause 6.5.2 "Whole arrays" [121:10-12] permits an assumed-size
array to appear as an actual argument in a procedure reference.
Consider the program

      MODULE TYPES
        TYPE REC
          INTEGER A
        END TYPE
        TYPE, EXTENDS(REC) :: REC2
          INTEGER B
        END TYPE
      END

      SUBROUTINE SUB1(A, N)
        USE TYPES
        CLASS(REC), INTENT(IN) :: A(*)
        CALL SUB2(A, N)
      END

      SUBROUTINE SUB2(A, N)
        USE TYPES
        TYPE(REC) A(*)
        PRINT *, A(:N)%A
      END

      PROGRAM MAIN
        USE TYPES
        CLASS(REC), ALLOCATABLE :: A(:)
        INTERFACE
          SUBROUTINE SUB1(A, N)
            USE TYPES
            CLASS(REC), INTENT(IN) :: A(*)
          END SUBROUTINE
        END INTERFACE

        ALLOCATE (A, SOURCE = (/(REC2(I, -I), I = 1, 10)/))
        CALL SUB1(A, 10)
      END

The subroutine reference in SUB1 that invokes SUB2 appears to be
standard conforming according to that clause.  Is that intended?

ANSWER:

Depending on the processor's calling conventions, the invocation of
SUB2 in SUB1 might require the shape, in which case it would not be
conforming on that processor.  It was not intended to be conforming
on any processor.

An edit is supplied to clarify this.

TITLE: Which part of an effective argument becomes undefined?
KEYWORDS: INTENT(OUT), extended type

STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 2

QUESTION:

The last sentence of paragraph 17 of Clause 12.5.2.4
[294:42-295:2] states

     If the dummy argument is not polymorphic and the type of
     the effective argument is an extension of the type of the
     dummy argument, only the part of the effective argument
     that is of the same type as the dummy argument becomes
     undefined.

The effective argument might have several parts that are of the
same type as the dummy argument.  Should the sentence say that
only the ancestor component of the effective argument that has
the same type as the dummy argument becomes undefined?

A possible edit is to replace the last sentence of paragraph 17
of Clause 12.5.2.4 with

     If the dummy argument is not polymorphic and the type of
     the dummy argument is the type of an ancestor
     component (4.5.7.2) of the effective argument, only that
     component of the effective argument becomes undefined.

ANSWER:

A nonpolymorphic dummy argument should not be able to be argument
associated with an effective argument that has a different dynamic
type.  That mistake was corrected by interpretation F08/0068.

The quoted text from the standard is therefore a mistake; an edit
is supplied to correct it.

TITLE: Finalization of INTENT(OUT) arguments
KEYWORDS: finalization INTENT(OUT)
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 2

QUESTION:

The following questions assume the new text for paragraph 8 of
Clause 4.5.6.3 provided in Corrigendum 1.  The new text states

     When a procedure is invoked, an object that becomes
     argument associated with a nonpointer, nonallocatable
     INTENT(OUT) dummy argument of that procedure is
     finalized.  The finalization caused by INTENT(OUT) is
     considered to occur within the invoked procedure; so
     for elemental procedures, an INTENT(OUT) argument will
     be finalized only if a scalar or elemental final
     subroutine is available, regardless of the rank of the
     actual argument.

Question 1:

Suppose an explicit-shape dummy array is argument associated with an
array that has more elements than the dummy array.  Are all of the
elements of the effective argument of the dummy array finalized or
are only those elements associated with elements of the dummy array
finalized?

Question 2:

The last sentence of paragraph 17 of Clause 12.5.2.4 states

     If the dummy argument is not polymorphic and the type of
     the effective argument is an extension of the type of the
     dummy argument, only the part of the effective argument
     that is of the same type as the dummy argument becomes
     undefined.

In such a case, is the entire effective argument finalized or is only
the part of the effective argument that becomes undefined finalized?

Question 3:

Is the argument finalized before it becomes undefined?

Question 4:

If so, can its value be used in a specification expression?

ANSWERS:

A1. Only the part properly associated with the dummy argument was
    intended to be finalized; an edit is supplied to clarify this.

A2. This is answered by interpretations F08/0068 and F08/0069;
    the quoted text has been deleted.

A3. Yes.  This is clarified by the same edit as for question 1.

A4. No, because it becomes undefined on procedure invocation.

EDITS:

Delete, in the quoted text for paragraph 8 of Clause 4.5.6.3 provided
in Corrigendum 1,
  "an object that becomes argument associated with"
and after "is finalized" insert
  "before it becomes undefined"
Making the whole paragraph read
    "When a procedure is invoked, a nonpointer, nonallocatable

  END PROGRAM

The pointer assignment statement at (1) associates P with X.
The intrinsic assignment statement at (2) includes the effect of
pointer assignment of X to Y%Q, but is not a pointer assignment
statement.

The pointer assignment statement at (3) is not standard-conforming
according to 6.5.3.3.2 paragraph 2:
  "An array section with a vector subscript shall not be
   ... the <data-target> in a pointer assignment statement"

However, the intrinsic assignment statement at (4) is not subject to
this requirement as it is not a pointer assignment statement.

Note that the quoted paragraph is entirely  duplicative, as in:
 - the first bullet item is covered by 12.5.2.4p18,
 - the second bullet item is covered by C724 in 7.2.2.2
   (but C724 does not cover this case either),
 - the third bullet item is covered by C901 in 9.5.1.
Editorial improvements have been made in corrigendum 1.  The entire
paragraph has been rewritten.

Q1. Was the statement marked (4) intended to be allowed?

Q2. If not, was it intended to be prohibited by a constraint like
    C724, or was it intended to be a simple requirement?
    (Editorial note: in any case surely the requirement should appear
    in the pointer assignment subclause.)

A1. No, this was not intended.  An edit is supplied to correct this.

A2. Constraint C724 was intended to cover this case.  An edit is

STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 2

QUESTION:

Consider

  Program m198_1
    Implicit Complex(a-z)
    Logical x
    x = .True.
    Block
      Dimension x(2)
      x = 3
      Print *,x
    End Block
  End Program

Is this standard-conforming, and if so, what is the type of the X
inside the BLOCK construct?

The Fortran 2008 standard specifies the implicit mapping in program
units, interface bodies, internal procedures, and module procedures,
at 5.5p3, but does not specify the implicit mapping in a BLOCK
construct.

ANSWER:

This was intended to be standard-conforming; the type of X is COMPLEX.
An edit is provided to remedy this omission.

EDIT:

[109:16] In 5.5p3, last sentence,
         After "and the default for"
         change "an internal or module procedure"
         to "a BLOCK construct, internal subprogram, or module
         subprogram".

This makes the whole sentence read
  "If a mapping is not specified for a letter, the default for a
   program unit or an interface body is default integer if the letter
   is I, J, ..., or N and default real otherwise, and the default for
   a BLOCK construct, internal subprogram, or module subprogram, is
   the mapping in the host scoping unit."

QUESTION:

(1) Consider the following

  module Funcs

    interface operator ( .op. )
      module procedure Unary, Binary
    end interface

  contains

    function Unary ( Arg )
      integer, intent(in) :: Arg
      integer, pointer :: Unary
    ...
    end function Unary

    function Binary ( Arg1, Arg2 )
      integer, intent(in) :: Arg1, Arg2
      integer, pointer :: Binary
    ...
    end function Binary

  end module Funcs

  program What

    use Funcs
    integer :: X, Y = 42

    10 .op. x = y

  end program What

Is the "10" in "10 .op. x = y" an operand, and therefore an argument of
a reference to Binary, or is .op. a reference to Unary and "10" a
statement label?

(2) Consider the following

  module Funcs

    interface operator ( .op. )
      module procedure Unary, Binary
    end interface

  contains

    function Unary ( Arg )
      integer, intent(in) :: Arg
      character(len=...), pointer :: Unary
    ...
    end function Unary

    function Binary ( Arg1, Arg2 )
      integer, intent(in) :: Arg1, Arg2
      character(len=...), pointer :: Binary
    ...
    end function Binary

  end module Funcs

  program What

    use Funcs
    integer :: X = 42, Y

    read (10) .op. x, y

  end program What

Is "10" an <io-control-spec-list>, or is "(10) .op. x" a <format>?

Note that this program is valid Fortran 90, and "(10) .op. x" is
a <format> according to the Fortran 90 standard.

ANSWER:

It was an oversight that the programs in (1) and (2) conform to the
syntax and constraints in two different ways.

The problem stems from the over-ambitious extension of allowing
pointer function references to denote variables; this was unambiguous
for <function-reference> syntax, but is not for operator syntax.
Also, operator syntax has other restrictions on it that are intended
to prevent modification of an operand, and these are subverted if the
result is treated as a variable.

Edits are supplied to remove the treatment of pointer-valued operators
as variables.

TITLE: Function references as variables in DATA statements

STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 2

QUESTION:

The Fortran 2008 standard extended the syntax of variables to
allow references to functions to be variables (6.2, 117:13,15).
Because of that extension, a function reference may appear as a
<data-stmt-object> (5.4.7, 104:15).  For example, the program

      PROGRAM DATA
        REAL, TARGET :: X
        DATA PF()/1.0/
      CONTAINS
        FUNCTION PF()
          REAL, POINTER :: PF
          PF => X
        END FUNCTION
      END

satisfies the syntax rules and constraints of Fortran 2008.
Was this intended?

ANSWER:

References to function were not intended to be allowed as
<data-stmt-object>s.  An edit is supplied to correct this
oversight.

EDIT:

[5.4.7, 104:26-27]

Replace
    "In a <variable> that is a <data-stmt-object>, each

TITLE: Are the IEEE values +0 and -0 distinguished
KEYWORDS: IEEE, zero, IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 2

QUESTION:

Suppose the value of IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE is true for arguments of
some kind type parameter values for a processor.  Is the processor
required to distinguish between the real values +0 and -0 if the kind
type parameter value of those zeros is among the kind type parameter
values for which IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE is true?

ANSWER:

No, the processor is not required to distinguish between positive and
negative zero.


DISCUSSION:

If IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE is true, IEEE_COPY_SIGN is required to behave
differently with positive and negative zero representations; however
this is because the IEEE_COPY_SIGN function copies the "sign bit" of
the underlying representation, and in this it is acting in the same
manner as the TRANSFER intrinsic.

This means that even on a processor that does not distinguish between
positive and negative zero in the places where the Fortran standard
has different behaviour depending on that distinction (viz I/O and
the SIGN intrinsic), the processor can still provide the IEEE features
and the user can still access the IEEE copysign functionality using
the IEEE_COPY_SIGN function.

EDITS:

  In Note 4.8 change "can distinguish" to "distinguishes".

The declared type of X is specified by the type declaration marked

The standard required, at 5.6p5,
  "A namelist group object ... shall have its ... type parameters
   ... specified by previous specification statements ...".
This was modified by Corrigendum 1 to read
  "A namelist group object ... shall have its ... kind type
   parameters ... specified by previous specification statements ...".

The declared type of X has the kind type parameter P, and this is duly
specified at the statement marked "! A", but the dynamic type of X
after either of the assignment statements marked "! C" or "! D" has an
additional kind type parameter K, and this specification does not
precede the NAMELIST statement.

Is this program intended to be standard-conforming?

Q3.  Consider the program consisting of the same module as in Q2, but
     with the revised main program:

  Program test
    Use m198_002b
    Implicit Type(t(6)) (a-z)
    Namelist/n/x
    Class(t(6)),Pointer :: x                  ! A
    Allocate(x,Source=t(6)(1.5))              ! B
    Write (*,n)
    Allocate(x,Source=t2(6,int32)(1.5,2**30)) ! C
    Write (*,n)
    Allocate(x,Source=t2(6,int64)(1.5,2**60)) ! D
    Write (*,n)
  End Program

The standard says at 5.6p5
  "If a namelist group object is typed by the implicit typing rules,
   its appearance in any subsequent type declaration statement shall
   confirm the implied type and type parameters."

The declared type of X, and its declared kind type parameters, are
specified at "! A", and these are indeed the same type and type
parameters that appear in the IMPLICIT statement, but X is CLASS(T(6))
not TYPE(T(6)).

Is this program intended to be standard-conforming?

Q4.  Consider

  Module m198_002d

    Write (*,n)
    Allocate(x,Source=t2(2,5)([15,30],[4,3,2,1,0])) ! D
    Write (*,n)
  End Program

The declared type of X, and its declared kind type parameters (of
which there are none), are specified at "! A", and these are indeed
the same type and kind type parameters that appear in the IMPLICIT
statement, but the length type parameters are not the same.  However,
after Corrigendum 1 there is no requirement for prior specification of
the length type parameters, so it is unclear whether the requirement
for confirmation is intended to apply to length type parameters as
well as kind type parameters.

Is this program intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

A1.  This program was intended to be conforming.  The requirement for
     prior specification of the type was intended to mean the declared
     type only.  An edit is supplied to clarify the intent.

A2.  This program was intended to be conforming.  The requirement for
     prior specification of the kind type parameters was intended to
     apply only to type parameters of the declared type.  An edit is
     supplied to clarify the intent.

A3.  This program is conforming.

A4.  This program is not conforming.  If the IMPLICIT statement were
       Implicit Type(t(:)) (a-z)
     it would be conforming.  No edit is necessary.

    Allocate(y,Source=t(3))
    Print *, [ t :: x, y ]
  End Program

Constraint C4105 of the standard, page 85, says
  "If <type-spec> specifies a derived type, all <ac-value> expressions
   in the array constructor shall be of that derived type ..."

However, although the declared type of X is type T, its dynamic type
is type T2.

Does this program conform to the standard?

Q2.  Consider

  Program m198_003b
    Type :: t
      Real a
    End Type
    Type,Extends(t) :: t2(n)
      Integer,Len :: n
      Real b(n)
    End Type
    Class(t),Allocatable :: x,y,z
    Allocate(x,Source=t2(3)(1,[2,3,4]))
    Allocate(y,Source=t(5))
    Allocate(z,Source=t2(4)(6,7))
    Print *, [ x, y, z ]
  End Program

4.8 paragraph 2 of the standard says
  "If <type-spec> is omitted, each <ac-value> expression shall have
   the same length type parameters; in this case, the declared type
   and type parameters of the array constructor are those of the
   <ac-value> expressions."

However, although the length type parameters of the declared types of
X, Y and Z are the same (all being the empty set), the length type
parameters of the dynamic types are not: Y has no dynamic length type
parameters, and the value of the dynamic length type parameter N of X
and Z are different.

Does this program conform to the standard?

Q3.  Consider

  Program m198_003c
    Type,Abstract :: t
      Real a
    End Type
    Type,Extends(t) :: t2
      Real b
    End Type
    Class(t),Allocatable :: x,y
    Allocate(x,Source=t2(1,2))
    Allocate(y,Source=t2(3,4))
    Print *, [ x, y ]
  End Program

This appears to conform to the standard, but the dynamic type of the
array constructor is the same as its declared type, and is therefore
abstract.  Is this intended to conform to the standard?

ANSWER:

A1. This program was intended to be conforming.
    An edit is supplied to clarify the standard.

A2. This program was intended to be conforming.
    An edit is supplied to clarify the standard.

A3. This program was not intended to be conforming.

TITLE: Deallocation error handling
KEYWORDS: FINAL, DEALLOCATE, ALLOCATABLE
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 2

QUESTION:

Q1. Consider
  Module m198_005a
    Implicit None
    Type t
      Character(80) :: name = 'Nameless'
    Contains
      Final :: tzap
    End Type
    Private tzap
  Contains
    Subroutine tzap(x)
      Type(t) x
      Print *,'Goodbye ',Trim(x%name)
    End Subroutine
    Subroutine test(p)
      Type(t),Pointer :: p
      Integer istat
      Deallocate(p,Stat=istat)
      If (istat/=0) Print *,'Deallocation error',istat
    End Subroutine
  End Module
  Program testprog
    Use m198_005a
    Type(t),Target :: x
    Type(t),Pointer :: y
    Allocate(y)
    x%name = 'target_x'
    y%name = 'allocated_y'
    Call test(y)
    y => x
    Call test(y)
  End Program

Is this program standard-conforming, and if so, does it print
 Goodbye target_x
?

Note that 4.5.6.3 says
  "When a pointer is deallocated its target is finalized."
This could be interpreted as meaning "successfully deallocated" in
which case the finalizer would not be invoked, or it could be
interpreted as including any unsuccessful deallocation attempt, in
which case the finalizer would be invoked.

Q2. Consider
  Program m198_005b
    Implicit None
    Type t
      Character(:),Allocatable :: name
    End Type
    Type(t),Target :: x
    Type(t),Pointer :: y
    Integer :: istat
    Allocate(y)
    x%name = 'target_x'
    y%name = 'allocated_y'
    Deallocate(y)
    y => x
    Deallocate(y,Stat=istat)
    If (.Not.Allocated(x%name)) Print *,'x is now nameless'
  End Program

6.7.3.2 says
  "When a variable of derived type is deallocated, any allocated
   allocatable subobject is deallocated."

Again, this does not specify whether this applies only to successful
deallocation.

Is this program standard-conforming, and does it print
 x is now nameless
?

ANSWER:

Whether the final subroutine is invoked, and whether any allocated
allocatable subobject is deallocated, is processor dependent.

EDITS:

After corrigendum 1, constraint C1214 reads

        arguments (9.6.4.8.3) shall be distinguishable.

The scope of the WRITE(FORMATTED) generic-spec is the entire module
M198_010, and within that module, the two procedures MP1 and MP2 have
the same identifier (G), but their DTV arguments are not
distinguishable.  This clearly violates the new C1214, but the module

TITLE: Pointer arguments to PURE functions
KEYWORDS: PURE function, POINTER, INTENT(IN)
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 3

QUESTION:

 Consider the following subprogram:

   Real Pure Function F( X )
     Real,Pointer :: X
     Real :: F
     f = 1.0
     x = 2.0    ! (A)
     Nullify(x) ! (B)
   End Function F

 This subprogram does not conform to Fortran 2003, because both
 statements (A) and (B) violate constraint C1272 which says
   "C1272 In a pure subprogram any designator with a base object that
          ... is a dummy argument of a pure function ... shall not be
          used ... [in] a variable definition context ...".

However, the corresponding constraint in Fortran 2008, C1283, is
missing the condition that applies the constraint to a dummy
argument of a pure function, except when it has INTENT(IN).  Thus
the statements marked (A) and (B) do not violate C1283, and
therefore this subprogram appears to conform to Fortran 2008.

Was this subprogram intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

No, this subprogram was not intended to be standard-conforming.
An edit is supplied to re-insert the omitted condition.

NUMBER: F08/0085
TITLE: Problems with PARAMETERs
KEYWORDS: PARAMETER
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 3

QUESTION:

(1) Consider the program fragment

    Subroutine s
      Parameter (n=1)
      Integer :: x,n       !(A)
      Parameter (x=3)

    The type declaration statement marked "!(A)", declares the
    entities X and N to be of type INTEGER.  Furthermore, as we see by
    the immediately preceding and following PARAMETER statements, both
    X and N are named constants.

    Unfortunately, a constraint says
      C507 (R503) "An <initialization> shall appear if the entity is a
                   named constant (5.3.13)."
    (BTW, R503 is <entity-decl>.)

    Therefore one concludes that the type declaration statement marked
    "!(A)" is not conforming as it violates C507 for both X and N.

    Is this statement intended to be conforming?

(2) Firstly, consider

    Subroutine s2(n)
      Integer,Parameter :: x(n:n+1) = [ 1,2 ]
      Character(n),Parameter :: y = 'abc'
      ...

    The type declaration statements are not conforming because
    according to 5.2.2p1, X and Y are automatic data objects, and C506
    says that <initialization> shall not appear in that case.

    Now consider

    Subroutine s2b(n)
      Implicit Character(n) (a-z)
      Parameter (y = 'abc')
      Integer :: x(n:n+1)
      Parameter(x=[1,2])

    This is not valid Fortran 2003, because 5.2 contains the
    requirement:
      "The combination of attributes that may be specified for a
       particular entity is subject to the same restrictions as for
       type declaration statements regardless of the method of
       specification.  This also applies to PROCEDURE, EXTERNAL, and
       INTRINSIC statements."

    This requirement does not appear in F2008.  However, there is no
    indication in the Introduction of this new feature.

    Is this extension to Fortran 2003 deliberate?

ANSWER:

(1) Yes, the type declaration statement was intended to be allowed.
    An edit is supplied to correct this mistake.

(2) No, the omission of this requirement was inadvertent.  An edit
    is supplied to correct this mistake.

EDITS:

[88:14] In 5.2.1, Replace constraint "C507 (503)" completely with
  "C507 (R501) If the PARAMETER keyword appears, <initialization>
        shall appear in each <entity-decl>."
{Fix Q1.}

[88:14+] In 5.2.1, immediately after constraint C507, insert new
         constraint:

TITLE:  Implied-shape and separate PARAMETER statement
KEYWORDS: Implied-shape, PARAMETER
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 3

QUESTION:

Q1.  Consider

  Program test1
    Character(*) a,b(*)
    Dimension c(*)
    Parameter (a='123', b=['1','2','3'])
    Character(*),Parameter :: c = [ '44','55','66' ]
    Print *,a,b,c
  End

The definition of the assumed-length character named constant A
conforms to Fortran 77 to Fortran 2008.  However, the definition of
the implied-shape named constant B appears not to conform to Fortran
2008, as the standard says in 5.4.11p2
  "A named array constant defined by a PARAMETER statement shall have
   its shape specified in a prior specification statement."
On the other hand, the named constant C does not have such a
requirement, so its definition would appear to be conforming.

This apparent requirement on the named constant B would thus appear to
be inconsistent with those on the named constant C, as well as
inconsistent with the way that assumed length works, and with the
general principle of allowing attributes to be specified either in a
single type declaration statement or with separate specification
statements.

Is the program intended to conform to the Fortran standard?

Q2. Consider

  Subroutine test2(a)
    Real,Dimension(*) :: a,c
    Parameter (c = [ 45.6 ])
    a(:size(c)) = c
  End Subroutine

The <array-spec> in the type declaration statement is ambiguous; if it
is an <implied-shape-spec> then the declaration of A as an
assumed-size array is erroneous, but if it is an <assumed-size-spec>
then the declaration of C as an implied-shape array is erroneous.

Is this program-unit intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

A1. Yes, the program was intended to conform to the Fortran standard.
    An edit is provided to modify the requirement for prior
    specification so as to allow this case.

A2. Yes, the program is intended to conform to the Fortran standard.
    An edit is provided to add syntax to permit this unambiguously.

  The current wording of C533 is slightly defective, as it does not

  how that does indeed declare "the array bounds of a dummy data

This program conforms to Fortran 95, which permitted user-defined
assignment between all characters with different kinds.

However, Fortran 2008 provides intrinsic assignment between
ISO 10646 characters and ASCII characters, so user-defined assignment
is not permitted (12.4.3.4.3 and Table 7.8).

Thus there seems to be a contradiction between the Fortran 95
compatibility description in 1.6.3 and 12.4.3.4.3.

Is the program intended to conform to Fortran 2008?
And if it does, does it print
 "Hello     "
(intrinsic assignment)
 "Ifmmp*****"
(user-defined assignment)?

ANSWER:

The program was not intended to conform to the standard.
An edit is provided to remove the contradiction.

TITLE: Can ALLOCATE with SOURCE= have side-effects in a PURE proc?
KEYWORDS: Allocate, SOURCE=, PURE, side-effects
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 3

QUESTION:

On comp.lang.fortran Ian Harvey brought up a pointer/PURE
question.

Given a type definition like

 type :: int_ptr
    integer, pointer :: i
 end type int_ptr

And a PURE function like

  PURE function FUN (arg)
    type(int_ptr), intent(in) :: arg
    type(int_ptr), allocatable :: tmp
    FUN = 1
    allocate (tmp, source=arg)
    tmp%i = 2
  end function fun

Is FUN standard conforming?

Doesn't the use of source=arg allow the function to modify a global
entity via the tmp%i = ...?  There don't seem to be any constraints on
what arg%i can point to, which means that the assignment to tmp%i can
have side effects.

Note that C1283(1) prevents usage like
    arg%i = 2

ANSWER:

This was not intended to be standard-conforming.
An edit is supplied to remedy this oversight.

TITLE:  What restrictions apply to initialization and PARAMETER?
KEYWORDS: PARAMETER, initialization, conformable, type conversion

QUESTION:

Consider the programs

  Program m200c3_1
    Integer :: a(10,10)
    Parameter (a = [ (i,i=1,100) ] )
    Print *,a
  End Program

  Program m200c3_2

  End Program

  Program m200c3_4
    Integer :: y = 'ok'

  End Program

The PARAMETER statement for the named constant A has an expression
whose shape does not conform with that of A.  The PARAMETER statement
for the named constant B has an expression whose type does not conform
to that of B.  The <initialization> for X is not conformable in shape.
The <initialization> for Y is not conformable in type.

There appears to be no requirement either for shape or type
conformance, in Fortran 2008 or in previous Fortran standards, except
for initializing data pointers.

Q1. Do any of these programs conform to Fortran 2008?

Q2. If there is meant to be a requirement for the shapes to conform or
    for the types to be convertible, should this not be a constraint?

ANSWER:

A1. No, these programs do not conform to Fortran 2008, as no
    interpretation is established for any of them.  Edits are
    provided to clarify this.

A2. This is not a constraint.  A future revision of Fortran might
    choose to mandate diagnosis of these errors.

QUESTION:

Q1. Consider

  Program m7_1
  Type empty
  End Type
  Type(empty),Target :: x
  Type(empty),Pointer :: y
  y => x
  Print *,Associated(y,x)
  End

Is this program standard-conforming, and does it print T or F?

According to 16.5.3.2p2,
  item 1  is default integer etc, N/A
  item 2 is double precision etc, N/A
  item 3 is default character, N/A
  item 4 is C character, N/A
  item 5 is SEQUENCE type, N/A

According to item (6),
  "a nonpointer scalar object of any type not specified in items
   (1)-(5) occupies a single unspecified storage unit that is
   different [from everything else]"

If that analysis is correct, X occupies a single unspecified storage
unit, not zero storage units, and therefore T should be printed.

Q2. Consider

  Program m7_2
  Type sempty
    Sequence
  End Type
  Type(sempty),Target :: x
  Type(sempty),Pointer :: y
  y => x
  Print *,Associated(y,x)
  End

Is this program standard-conforming, and does it print T or F?

Now X falls into item 5, which makes it a "sequence of storage
sequences corresponding to the sequence of its ultimate components";
there are no ultimate components, this makes it a zero-sized storage
sequence and therefore F should be printed.

This does not seem to be consistent with the apparent answer to Q1.

Q3. Consider

  Program m7_3
  Type numeric_empty
    Sequence
  End Type
  Type character_empty
    Sequence
  End Type
  Type(numeric_empty) a
  Integer b
  Character c
  Type(character_empty) d
  Equivalence(a,b)             ! E1.
  Equivalence(c,d)             ! E2.
  End

Is this program conforming?

According to the definitions in 4.5.2.3, NUMERIC_EMPTY is a numeric
sequence type and therefore one might expect to be able to EQUIVALENCE
it to an INTEGER.  Similarly, CHARACTER_EMPTY is a character sequence
type and therefore one might expect to be able to EQUIVALENCE it to a
CHARACTER.

However, NUMERIC_EMPTY is clearly also a character sequence type, and
therefore statement E1 violates C592 because B is not character or
character sequence.

Similarly, CHARACTER_EMPTY is clearly also a numeric sequence type,
and therefore statement E2 violates C591.

It seems very strange to have a type that is simultaneously numeric
and character sequence type.

Q4. Consider

  Program m7_4
  Type numeric_empty_2
    Sequence
    Real c(0)
  End Type
  Type character_empty_2
    Sequence
    Character(0) c
  End Type
  Type(numeric_empty_2) a
  Integer b
  Character c
  Type(character_empty_2) d
  Equivalence(a,b)             ! E3.
  Equivalence(c,d)             ! E4.
  End

Does this program conform?

According to the definitions in 4.5.2.3, NUMERIC_EMPTY_2 is a numeric
sequence type and not a character sequence type, and conversely
CHARACTER_EMPTY_2 is a character sequence type and not a numeric
sequence type, and therefore the constraints for the statements at E3
and E4 are not violated.

Thus this appears to be conforming, in contradiction to the example in
Q3, even though the storage sequence of NUMERIC_EMPTY,
NUMERIC_EMPTY_2, CHARACTER_EMPTY, and CHARACTER_EMPTY_2 are all the
same.

This does not look very consistent with the situation in Q3.

ANSWER:

A1.  The program is conforming and prints T.

A2.  The program was not intended to conform; SEQUENCE makes no sense
     when there are no components.  An edit is needed to correct this.

A3.  The program does not conform as a sequence type must have at
     least one component.

A4.  The program is conforming.  The apparent design inconsistency is
     not an error in the standard.

TITLE: Process exit status and error termination
KEYWORD: ERROR STOP
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 3

QUESTION:

Many operating systems today (e.g. Posix-related ones) use a process
exit status of zero to indicate successful execution, whereas nonzero
indicates an error.  (Occasionally nonzero values, e.g. 1, also
indicate success.)

Fortran STOP and ERROR STOP with an integer <stop-code> are
recommended to use the <stop-code> as the exit status.  The STOP
statement without an integer <stop-code> is recommended to have an
exit status of zero; this conforms to common practice since STOP
initiates normal termination.

The standard is silent on the effect of error termination, except in
the case of an ERROR STOP (sans integer <stop-code>) which is
unexpectedly recommended to also return an exit status of zero.

Q1. Is this intentional?  Should the exit code for ERROR STOP not have
    been recommended to be nonzero?

Q2. Should the recommendation for an ERROR STOP not also apply to
    error termination by other causes?

ANSWER:

A1. It was not intended to recommend returning "success" for error
    termination.  An edit is supplied to correct this.

A2. Yes, the recommendation for an ERROR STOP without an integer
    <stop-code> should also apply to other means of standard-defined
    error termination.  An edit is supplied to correct this omission.

Q1. Consider

  Subroutine s1(a)

Does this program unit conform to the standard?
7.1.12 item (4) permits
  "a specification inquiry where each designator or function argument
   is ...
     (b) a variable whose properties inquired about are not
        (i) assumed,
        (ii) deferred, or
        (iii) defined by an expression that is not a constant
              expression,"
PRESENT is a specification inquiry (because it is an intrinsic inquiry
function), and the standard does not say that the "presence" of an
optional dummy argument is an assumed or deferred attribute, and it
does not appear to be "defined by an expression" either.

On the other hand, the standard does not say anything about what kind
of property the presence is.

the rules for specification expression, similarly to how it satisfies
the rules for a constant expression, but then the standard is silent

<lock-stat-list> so that does not apply.  There is no constraint
anywhere about how many ACQUIRED_LOCK= specifiers may appear.

ANSWER:

No, this was not intended to be conforming.  No specifier was intended
to be allowed to appear more than once.

[194:2+] 8.5.6, after R864, insert new constraint

QUESTION:

Is the following subprogram required always to print "T T"?

  subroutine Wobbly ( N )
    integer, volatile :: N
    integer :: A ( n, n )
    integer :: B ( n * n )
    print *, size(a) == size(b), size(a,1) == size(a,2)
  end subroutine Wobbly

ANSWER:

No.

There are three specification expressions in the subroutine, and the
volatile variable N appears in each of them.  Since, being volatile,
the variable N might have a different value each time it is
referenced, these three specification expressions might receive
different values for their references to N.  If that happens, the
array sizes might well be different.

QUESTION:

Q1. Does the following program fragment conform to the 2008 standard?

  subroutine S ( P )
    interface
      subroutine Q ( X )
        real, intent(inout) :: X
      end subroutine Q
    end interface
    interface
      subroutine P ( A )
        import
        procedure (R) :: A
      end subroutine P
    end interface
    procedure (Q) :: R
  end subroutine S

12.4.3.3p2 says "If an entity that is made accessible by this means is
accessed by host association and is defined in the host scoping unit, it
shall be explicitly declared prior to the interface body."

However, although the procedure R is declared in the host scoping unit
it is not defined in the host scoping unit, so this is ineffective.

Q2. If the IMPORT statement were changed to "IMPORT R", would that be
    conforming?

12.4.3.3p1 says
  "An entity that is imported in this manner and is defined in the
   host scoping unit shall be explicitly declared prior to the
   interface body."

Again, procedure R is declared but not defined in the host scoping
unit, so this requirement is ineffective.

ANSWER:

These examples were not intended to conform to the Fortran standard.

QUESTION:

Consider

  Program p1
    Real :: x = 3, y = 4
    Namelist /n/ x, y
    Write (*,n)
  End Program

According to 5.6,
  "The order in which the variables are specified in the NAMELIST
   statement determines the order in which the values appear on
   output."

However, this stops short of saying that the order is the same, merely
that it determines it.  Perhaps it might be standard-conforming for a
processor to always produce the values in reverse order, for example.
10.11.4 does not seem to address the issue of what the order is.

Q1: Is the order meant to be the same?

Consider

  Program p2
    Real :: x = 3, y = 4
    Namelist /n/ x, y, x
    Write (*,n)
  End Program

This program did not conform to Fortran 90, but does conform to
Fortran 2003 and later.  The Fortran 2008 standard says (5.6p2):

  "The order in which the variables are specified in the NAMELIST
   statement determines the order in which the values appear on
   output."

However, there are only two variables in the NAMELIST statement, X
and Y.  Therefore it seems to be ambiguous whether the output should
be something like
  &N X=3 Y=4 /
or
  &N Y=4 X=3 /

Some compilers produce
  &N X=3 Y=4 X=3 /
but this is not an ordering of the variables X and Y.

Q2. Is this program intended to conform to the standard, and if so,
    what is the intended output?

ANSWER:

A1. Yes, the order is meant to be the same.  An edit is supplied to
    clarify this.

A2. The program was intended to conform to the standard, and the output
    was intended to be the third option.  An edit is supplied to
    correct the text in 5.6.

According to the standard, the type of the result of MERGE is the same
as the type of TSOURCE.  One might imagine that this means that the
result is polymorphic if and only if TSOURCE is polymorphic.  This
would be a slightly unusual and unexpected asymmetry.

Also, the types of FSOURCE and TSOURCE have to be the same.  If this
means both the declared and dynamic types, one might imagine that this
means that the result is polymorphic if and only if both FSOURCE and
TSOURCE are polymorphic, since otherwise the non-polymorphic argument
decides the type.

On the other hand, if the type requirements are talking about the
declared type only, one might imagine that the result is polymorphic
if either TSOURCE or FSOURCE is polymorphic.

However, in any case there would seem to be an error in the standard,
since the result is specified to be the same as TSOURCE, rather than
the same as whichever argument is chosen to be the result value; if
this refers to the dynamic type, it is contradictory when FSOURCE is
chosen as the result value.  And if it does not refer to the dynamic
type, there appears to be no statement which says what the dynamic
type of the result is.

Q1.  Is the apparent asymmetry between the treatment of TSOURCE and
     FSOURCE intended?

Q2.  Which of the MERGE invocations A-E are polymorphic?

Q3.  When the result of MERGE is polymorphic, are the dynamic types of
     TSOURCE and FSOURCE permitted to be different?  And if they are,
     is the dynamic type of the result the same as the chosen argument
     and not necessarily the same as TSOURCE?

ANSWER:

A1. There is no asymmetry between TSOURCE and FSOURCE, because they
    are required to have the same type and type parameters.  This
    means that both the declared and dynamic types and type parameters
    must be the same.

A2. Only MERGE invocation E is polymorphic.  An edit is provided to
    clarify this.

A3. No, the dynamic types and type parameters are required to be the
    same.

Note that because MERGE is elemental, it needs the type and type
parameters to be the same for both the declared and dynamic types,
otherwise the principle that all elements of an array have the same
(declared and dynamic) type and type parameters would be broken.

Does this program print all true values?

The procedure pointers are all associated with the internal procedure
INNER, which might lead one to believe that the answer is yes (that
is, they are all associated with the same target), but each procedure
pointer at each nesting level has a different host instance, which
might lead one to believe that the answer is no (and that therefore
only one of each of the 3-element sequences printed will be T).

ANSWER:

No, the program does not print all true values; two procedure pointers
to the "same" internal procedure are only associated if the host
instances are also the same.  An edit is supplied to the standard to
clarify this.

TITLE: IEEE Inquiry Functions
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 4

All references are to Fortran 2008 10-007r1.

On comp.lang.fortran Francis Coudert asked
 The Fortran 2008 standard defines an inquiry function
 as an "intrinsic function, or function in an intrinsic
 module, whose result depends on the properties of one
 or more of its arguments instead of their values".
 10-007r1 section 1.3.89 [11:27-30]

 I wonder: by that definition, how can the
 IEEE_SUPPORT_HALTING(FLAG) function from the
 IEEE_EXCEPTIONS intrinsic module be an inquiry function?
 Its result depends on the value of FLAG, not its
 properties.

QUESTIONS:

Question 1.

Are the functions

 IEEE_support_flag
 IEEE_support_halting
 IEEE_support_rounding
 c_associated
 c_funloc
 c_loc

intended to be inquiry functions?

Question 2.

Are they consistent with the definition of inquiry
functions?

Question 3.

Are they allowed in Specification expressions?

Question 4.

Are they allowed in Constant expressions?

ANSWERS:

Answer 1.

No.  These intrinsic module functions

 IEEE_support_flag
 IEEE_support_halting
 IEEE_support_rounding
 c_associated
 c_funloc
 c_loc

are not inquiry functions because their results depend on other than
the properties of their arguments.  Edits are provided to correctly
identify these functions as transformational:

[18:35-37] section 1.3.146
transformational function
intrinsic function, or function in an intrinsic module, that
is neither elemental nor an inquiry function

Answer 2.

No.  Their current classification is inconsistent with the definition
of inquiry functions.

Answer 3.

They should be allowed in specification expressions.  Edits are
provided to correct this.

Answer 4.

No. Only the 3 IEEE_* functions should be allowed in constant
expressions, not the 3 C_* functions.  Edits are provided to correct
this.

TITLE: Is the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute allowed with the VALUE attribute?
KEYWORDS: ASYNCHRONOUS, VALUE
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 4

QUESTION:

In the description of the VALUE attribute, [101:23-24] section
5.3.18p1, constraint C558 disallows the VOLATILE attribute with the
VALUE attribute:

  "C558 An entity with the VALUE attribute shall not have the
        ALLOCATABLE, INTENT (INOUT), INTENT (OUT), POINTER, or
        VOLATILE attributes."

But there is no prohibition of the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute with the
VALUE attribute.  Should this combination also be disallowed?

ANSWER:

No, the combination of VALUE and ASYNCHRONOUS attributes should not be
disallowed.  That is, the combination of VALUE and ASYNCHRONOUS
attributes should continue to be allowed.

A dummy argument with the VALUE attribute is not argument associated
with the corresponding actual argument.  Rather, it is associated with
an anonymous data object whose value is copied from the actual
argument before execution of the executable constructs of the
subprogram commences, and before expressions in the specification part
are evaluated.  Therefore, it can successfully take part in
asynchronous operations that both start and complete within that
procedure call, independently of whether the corresponding actual
argument has or has not the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute.

There is no problem if a dummy argument has the VALUE attribute and
the corresponding actual argument has the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute,
independently of whether the dummy argument has the ASYNCHRONOUS
attribute.  Subclause 9.6.4.1, paragraph 6 [220:13-15], prohibits an
actual argument that is part of a pending input storage sequence
affector from being associated with a dummy argument that has the
VALUE attribute.

    type(three), allocatable :: A[:]
  end type four

  type(four) :: X

ANSWERS:

1. Type two is not conforming, because the entity A has a coarray
   ultimate component and C525 requires such an entity to be a
   nonpointer nonallocatable scalar.  Therefore the declaration of V
   is not permitted.

2. X satisfies C525, so declaration of X is permitted.  X has an
   ultimate (allocatable) coarray component (A[:]), and therefore
   according to C526 must be a dummy argument or have the SAVE attribute.

KEYWORD: LOCK_TYPE, unlimited polymorphic
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 4

QUESTION:

Assume type LOCK_TYPE from the intrinsic module ISO_Fortran_Env is
available.

Q1. Is allocation of X%C permitted?

  TYPE t
    TYPE(LOCK_TYPE),ALLOCATABLE :: c
  END TYPE
  TYPE(t) :: x[*],y[*]
  ALLOCATE(y%c)
  ALLOCATE(x%c,SOURCE=y%c)

Q2. Is allocation of C permitted?

  class(*), pointer :: C
  type(lock_type), intent(in) :: L[*]

  allocate ( C, source=L )

Q3. Is allocation of C permitted?

  class(*), pointer :: C

  allocate ( LOCK_TYPE :: C )

Q4. Is pointer assignment to C permitted?

  class(*), pointer :: C
  type(lock_type), intent(in), target :: L[*]

  c => L

Q5. Is this ALLOCATE statement conforming?

  CLASS(*),ALLOCATABLE, SAVE :: C[:]
  TYPE(LOCK_TYPE),      SAVE :: X[*]
  ALLOCATE(C[*],MOLD=X)

ANSWER:

A1. Allocation of X%C is not intended to be allowed.  An edit is
    supplied to correct the requirements on allocation of LOCK_TYPE.

A2. Allocation of C is not intended to be allowed.  An edit is
    supplied to correct the requirements on allocation of LOCK_TYPE.

A3. This allocation of C is permitted.  It cannot violate C1302 because
    that is a syntax constraint.  Only things that are statically
    detectable static properties of the program source text can be
    syntax constraints.  That means that "type" in C1302 can only mean
    "declared type".

    C is CLASS(*) so has no declared type and therefore cannot
    violate C1302.

    Edits are given to fix C1302 to say "declared type" explicitly to
    avoid this confusion.

    Note that it is impossible to actually use the allocated target of
    C in any useful fashion; SELECT TYPE cannot access it because the
    associate-name would be a named lock variable, but it is not a
    coarray so that would not be allowed.

    So this is permitted, but useless, and because it is useless it is
    also harmless.  A future revision could disallow this without the
    concomitant incompatibility inconveniencing any programs.

A4. Pointer assignment to C is permitted.

    As in A3, this is useless but harmless.  A future revision could
    disallow this without the concomitant incompatibility
    inconveniencing any programs.

A5. This statement was intended to be permitted.  An edit is supplied
    to correct the requirements.

Note that the term "potential subobject component" is defined in interp
F08/0124 and will be in F2008 Corrigendum 4:

  [6:7+] After definition 1.3.33.2 parent component, insert new term
    "1.3.33.2a
     potential subobject component
     nonpointer component, or potential subobject component of a
     nonpointer component".

EDITS to 10-007r1:

          Change "C_PTR," to "C_PTR or"
          Delete ", LOCK_TYPE ... LOCK_TYPE".

[127:9+] Insert new constraint
  "C642a (R627) If SOURCE= appears, the declared type of <source-expr>
         shall not be LOCK_TYPE or have a potential subobject
         component of type LOCK_TYPE."

[127:18-19] 6.7.1.1, p4,
  Instead of the edit in Corr. 2, make this change to the 10-007r1 text:

    Change "If <allocate-object> is" -> "If an ALLOCATE statement
            has a SOURCE= specifier and an <allocate-object> that is".
    {There is no problem with MOLD=.  "subcomponent" works ok here
     because we have an object not a type.}

  so p4 reads:

    "If an ALLOCATE statement has a SOURCE= specifier and an
     <allocate-object> that is a coarray, <source-expr> shall not have a
     dynamic type of C_PTR, C_FUNPTR, or LOCK_TYPE, or have a
     subcomponent whose dynamic type is LOCK_TYPE."

In each of the statements labelled A-D, there is a dependency between
the STAT= specifier and the ERRMSG= specifier (from STAT= to ERRMSG=
in A and B, and from ERRMSG= to STAT in C and D).  There appears to be
no prohibition against this (though there are many prohibitions

In each of the statements labelled A-F, there is a dependency between
the STAT= specifier and the ERRMSG= specifier.  There appears to be no
prohibition against this.

Additionally, in the LOCK statement (D), there is a dependency between
the ACQUIRED_LOCK= specifier and the STAT= specifier (there is no
dependency between ACQUIRED_LOCK= and ERRMSG= because the former is
only set on successful execution and the latter is only set on an
error condition).  There appears to be no restrictions at all on any
dependencies from ACQUIRED_LOCK=.

In the LOCK statement (F), there is a dependency between the STAT=
specifier and the lock variable.  Similarly for the UNLOCK (G), there
is a dependency between the lock variable and the ERRMSG= specifier.

In the SYNC IMAGES statement (H), there is a dependency between the
STAT= variable and the image set.  In the SYNC IMAGES statement (I),
there is a dependency between the ERRMSG= variable and the image set.

Are all these examples conforming, and if so, is the dependent
variable referenced with the value of the other variable at the
beginning of execution of the statement or at the end of execution of
the statement?

No interpretation is established and therefore these are not

Is the call to "Fred" standard-conforming?

It is not excluded by 5.3.4p2, because 'array' is merely associated
with 'arg' in subroutine Fred, and not used in any executable
statement or specification expression there.  However, if copy-in/out
is used for argument passing and the actual i/o transfer occurs in
between the copy-in and copy-out, the wrong answers will be given.

This program was not intended to be conforming.  An edit is provided

QUESTION:

In all cases, Alf is a Fortran procedure like this:

    SUBROUTINE Alf (Arg) BIND(C,NAME='Alf')
        INTERFACE
            SUBROUTINE Arg () BIND(C)
            END SUBROUTINE Arg
        END INTERFACE
        CALL Arg
    END SUBROUTINE Alf

Q1. Consider

    extern void Bert (void) {
        ;
    }

    int main (void) {
        Alf(Bert);
    }

15.5.1p2 requires a procedure defined by means other than Fortran to
have the same binding label as the interface.  Function Bert() has a
binding label of 'Bert', but 15.5.2p2 states that the dummy argument
Arg has no binding label, therefore 15.5.1p2 is not satisfied.

Was this intended to be conforming?

Q2. Consider

    static void Fred (void) {
        ;
    }

    int main (void) {
        Alf(Fred);
    }

15.5.1p2 requires a procedure defined by means other than Fortran to
have a name that has external linkage as defined by 6.2.2 of ISO/IEC
9899:1999.  Function Fred() has no such name, as its definition has
internal linkage.  However, linkage in C affects only the visibility
of the external name, and has no application to either types or
values, whether in the form of function parameters or other pointers.

Was this intended to be conforming?

Q3. Consider

    extern inline void arg (void) {
        ;
    }

    int main (void) {
        Alf(Joe);
    }

C99 6.7.4 describes the inline specifier.  This does not prevent it
from having external linkage, but
  "An inline definition does not provide an external definition for
   the function"
i.e. despite having external linkage, there might be no external
definition that could be invoked from Fortran.

Was it not an oversight not to exclude inline in 15.5.1?

ANSWERS:

A1. Yes, this was intended to be conforming.  An edit is provided to
    correct this mistake.

A2. Yes, this was intended to be conforming.  An edit is provided to
    correct this mistake.

A3. A C function with no external definition is not "defined by
    means other than Fortran" so much as "not defined".  This was
    not intended to be conforming.  An edit is provided to clarify
    this situation.

DISCUSSION:

This program is modifying an actual argument while it is associated
with a dummy argument.  That is normally prohibited by the anti-aliasing
rules in 12.5.2.13, but these do not operate in the TARGET dummy
argument case.  However, coindexed actual arguments are accessing
remote memory, so in general will be passed by copy-in/out; in this
case permitting aliasing is not reasonable.

The program is not intended to be conforming.  Edits are provided to

QUESTIONS:

Q1.  Consider

   Module m
     Type t
       Real,Allocatable :: co[:]
     End Type
     Type(t) x
     Real,Allocatable :: xco[:]
   Contains
     Subroutine dubious
       Volatile x
       Volatile xco
       ...
     End Subroutine
   End Module
   Program bad
     Use m
     Volatile x
     Volatile xco
     ...
   End Program

5.3.19 C560 says "The VOLATILE attribute shall not be specified for a
coarray that is accessed by use (11.2.2) or host (16.5.1.4)
association."

That means that the two "VOLATILE XCO" statements are not conforming.
However, the "VOLATILE X" statements have essentially the same effect,
but are unaffected by the constraint, which seems inconsistent.

Was this constraint also intended to apply to objects with coarray
components?

Q2.  Consider

    Program blockvolatile
      Type t
        Real,Allocatable :: co[:]
      End Type
      Type(t) x
      Real,Allocatable :: xco[:]
      ...
      Block
        Volatile x
        Volatile xco
      End Block

5.3.19 C561 says "Within a BLOCK construct (8.1.4), the VOLATILE
attribute shall not be specified for a coarray that is not a construct
entity (16.4) of that construct."

That means that VOLATILE XCO is not standard-conforming.  However, the
constraint apparently does not apply to X, so VOLATILE X is standard-
conforming, even though it has essentially the same effect as the
forbidden case.

Was this constraint intended also to apply to objects with coarray
components?

Q3. 5.3.19p1 says "A noncoarray object that has the VOLATILE attribute
    may be associated with an object that does not have the VOLATILE
    attribute..."; does this apply to objects with a coarray component?

Q4. 12.4.2.2p1 says "A procedure other than a statement function shall
    have an explicit interface if it is referenced and ... (2) the
    procedure has a dummy argument that ... (c) is a coarray, ...."

    Is this intended also to apply to objects with coarray components?

Q5.  Consider:

    Program volatility
      Type t
        Real,Allocatable :: co[:]
      End Type
      Type(t) :: x
      Type(t),Volatile :: y
      ...
      Call s1(x)
      Call s2(x) ! Dummy is volatile, X is not.
      Call s1(y) ! Y is volatile, dummy is not.
      Call s2(y)
    Contains
      Subroutine s1(a)
        Type(t) :: a
        ...
      End Subroutine
      Subroutine s2(b)
        Type(t),Volatile :: b
        ...
      End Subroutine
    End Program

12.5.2.8p1 says "If the dummy argument is a coarray, the corresponding
actual argument shall be a coarray and shall have the VOLATILE
attribute if and only if the dummy argument has the VOLATILE
attribute."

That means that if the program were passing the component CO directly
(and the TYPE(T) declarations in S1 and S2 were changed to REAL), the
second and third calls would not be conforming because of the VOLATILE
mismatch.

It seems inconsistent that there is no requirement for VOLATILE to
match when there are coarray components, since it has the same effect
that X%CO is VOLATILE in S2 but not in the caller, and Y%CO is
VOLATILE in the caller but not in S1.

Was this requirement also intended to apply to objects with coarray
components?

Q6. 12.8.1 C1289 says "All dummy arguments of an elemental procedure
    shall be scalar noncoarray dummy data objects and shall not have
    the POINTER or ALLOCATABLE attribute."

    Is this intended also to apply to objects with coarray components?

ANSWER:

A1. Yes, this constraint was intended to apply to objects with coarray
    components.  An edit is supplied to correct this omission.

A2. Yes, this constraint was intended to apply to objects with coarray
    components.  An edit is supplied to correct this omission.

A3. No, this does not apply to objects with coarray components, as
    there is no way of giving the noncoarray parts of the object the
    VOLATILE attribute without giving the coarray part the VOLATILE
    attribute, which is forbidden.  That the quoted text gives
    permission for a noncoarray to have the VOLATILE attribute does
    not override any other requirements in the standard.

A4. No.  A dummy argument that has a coarray component is still just
    an ordinary dummy argument, so this text does not apply.

A5. Yes, this requirement was intended to apply to objects with
    coarray components.  An edit is supplied to correct this omission.

A6. No.  A dummy argument that has a coarray component is still just

NUMBER: F08/0123
TITLE: SPACING intrinsic
KEYWORDS: SPACING
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 4

QUESTION:

Consider the following program

  Program test_spacing
    Real :: x, y, tiny_spacing, z
    x = Tiny(x)
    y  = Nearest(x,1.0)
    tiny_spacing = y - x
    If (tiny_spacing>0) Then
      ! Probably IEEE arithmetic with subnormals:
      ! the spacing y - x is representable.
    Else
      ! Probably no subnormals, so y - z is not representable.
      tiny_spacing = Tiny(x)
    End If
    z = Spacing(x)
    If (z/=tiny_spacing) Then
      Print *,'FAIL'
    Else
      Print *,'ok'
    End If
  End Program

Furthermore let us assume that the processor supports IEEE arithmetic
with subnormals, and that default REAL is IEEE single precision.

According to Fortran 95, the result for SPACING is:
  "If X is not zero, the result has the value b**(e-p), where b, e,
   and p are as defined in 13.7.1 for the model representation of X,
   provided this result is within range."
therefore the program is expected to print the value "ok".

However, according to Fortran 2008, the result for SPACING is:
  "If X does not have the value zero ..., the result has the value
   b**max(e-p,emin-1), where ..."
Unsurprisingly, e-p is not equal to max(e-p,emin-1) for smallish
numbers, and therefore the program would be expected to print the
value "FAIL".  However, there is no such incompatibility with Fortran
90/95 listed in clause 1, therefore the standard contradicts itself.
(The value specified in Fortran 2008 also contradicts the Description
of the function which says "Spacing of model numbers (13.4)", since
it does not even attempt to return that value.)

Is the new specification a deliberate incompatibility or a mistake?

DISCUSSION:

The description of SPACING was changed in Fortran 2003 by paper
01-361r2 "Comments on Section 13", which contains no justification for
this technical change and indeed does not even mention it is a
technical change - there is just the bare edit (buried in a huge list
of bare edits) with no indication as to why.  This would seem to
indicate that the technical change is an inadvertent error (presumably
the paper simply forgot about subnormal numbers and assumed the new
formula gave the same result as the old one).

ANSWER:

The new wording of SPACING inadvertently changed the return values
when IEEE subnormal values were available.  An edit is provided to
correct this mistake.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[389:4-5] 13.7.157 SPACING (X), p5 Result Value,
          Change "max(e-p,emin-1)" to "e-p" where e and p are in italics.
          After "that of X" insert
            ", provided this result is representable; otherwise the
             result is the same as that of TINY (X).",
          Change "; if there are two such values" to
          "If there are two extended model values equally near to X,".

This makes the whole paragraph read:

 If X does not have the value zero and is not an IEEE infinity or NaN,
 the result has the value b**(e-p), where b, e, and p are as defined
 in 13.4 for the value nearest to X in the model for real values whose
 kind type parameter is that of X, provided this result is
 representable; otherwise the result is the same as that of TINY (X).
 If there are two extended model values equally near to X, the value
 of greater absolute value is taken.  If X has the value zero, the
 result is the same as that of TINY (X).  If X is an IEEE infinity,
 the result is an IEEE NaN.  If X is an IEEE NaN, the result is that
 NaN."

where "b**(e-p)" represents the typesetting of $b^{e-p}$ and throughout
the edits, "b", "e" and "p" are in italics.

QUESTION:

Consider the following type definitions and object declarations:

  Type t1
    Class(*),Allocatable :: bad
  End Type

  Type t2
    Type(t1),Allocatable :: oops
  End Type

  Type(t1) x[*]
  Type(t2) y[*]

Do the following subroutine calls conform to the Fortran 2008 standard?

  Call s1(x[2])
  Call s2(y[2])

DISCUSSION:

If Y[2]%OOPS and Y[2]%OOPS%BAD are both allocated they are subobjects,
but only OOPS is a subcomponent of Y[2].  Since OOPS is not
polymorphic and BAD is not a subcomponent, this clearly does not
violate C617.  That seems inconsistent since in both cases a copy of
the coindexed variable would necessarily copy the polymorphic BAD
component.

ANSWER:

The intent of C617 was to prevent copying a polymorphic subobject of
a coindexed object.  Since a subobject is not always a subcomponent,
an edit is provided to correct the mistake of using the term
"subcomponent" in C617.

No, the example is not a valid program as it does not satisfy the

semicolon may be used to terminate a statement.  That is not the
case in the example, since there is no statement before the semicolon.

QUESTION:

Does the CLASS(T) declaration of X in the following conform?

recursive subroutine S ( N, X )
  integer :: N
  class(t), optional :: X
  type :: T
    integer :: Q
  end type T
...

ANSWER:

Although subclause 4.3.1.3 does not require the <derived-type-spec> in a
CLASS specifier to refer to a previously-defined type, it was intended
that CLASS declarations with <derived-type-spec> be parallel to TYPE
declarations.  In a TYPE declaration (4.3.1.2), the specified derived
type is required to be previously defined, or accessed by use or host
association.  Therefore the example ought not to conform.  Edits are
provided to correct this oversight.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[52:6+] 4.3.1.3 CLASS, p1+, insert new paragraph:

"Where a data entity other than a component is declared explicitly using
the CLASS specifier to be of derived type, the specified derived type
shall have been defined previously.  If the data entity is a function
result, the derived type may be specified in the FUNCTION statement
provided the derived type is defined within the body of the function or
is accessible there by use or host association.  If the derived type is
specified in the FUNCTION statement and is defined within the body of
the function, it is as if the function result variable were declared
with that derived type immediately following its <derived-type-def>."

{This is essentially identical to 4.3.1.2p1, except for the replacement
of "TYPE" with "CLASS" and the addition of "other than a component"
(4.3.1.2p1 does not mention components, but it ought to because
otherwise it would contradict C440), but that's a different question.}

Q1. On images other than image 1, does execution ever reach the

    6.7.1.2 Execution of an ALLOCATE statement, p4 says
      "When an ALLOCATE statement is executed for which an
       allocate-object is a coarray, there is an implicit
       synchronization of all images.  On each image, execution of the
       segment (8.5.2) following the statement is delayed until all
       other images have executed the same statement the same number
       of times."

    The second sentence seems to say that execution on images>1 is
    delayed forever, since image 1 will never execute that ALLOCATE
    statement.

Example 2: Consider the program

  Program m206c7e2
    Use Iso_Fortran_Env
    Implicit None
    Real(real32), Allocatable :: x(:,:,:,:)[:],y(:,:,:,:)
    Integer :: me[*],i
    Integer stat
    me = This_Image()
    If (Num_Images()<3) Error Stop 'Need at least 3 images'
    If (me==1) Then
      Allocate(y(1000,1000,1000,1000))                !***C
    End If
    Allocate(x(1000,1000,1000,1000)[*],Stat=stat)     !***D
    !
    If (me==1 .And. stat==0) Error Stop 'Inconceivable!'
    !
    If (stat==0) Print *, 'ALLOCATE ok on image', me  !***E
    !
    Do i=1,Num_Images()
      If (me[i]/=i) Error Stop 'me not right?'        !***F
    End Do
  End Program

For purposes of discussion, let us assume that each image has 6
Terabytes of memory available to it for dynamic allocation.

The ALLOCATE statement commented "!***C" will allocate 4 terabytes of
memory on image 1.  Execution of the ALLOCATE statement commented
"!***D" will attempt to allocate 4 terabytes on each image; this will
fail on image 1 as there is insufficient memory available, but could
succeed on other images.

Q2. Is the success of an ALLOCATE statement the same on every image,
    or may it fail on some images and succeed on others?  That is,
    might the statement commented "!***E" execute the PRINT on some
    images (but not all).

Q2 continuation:
    If the answer is that the ALLOCATE must either succeed or fail on
    all images, can the STAT= value differ by image (for example,
    might a processor return a different STAT= code for "no memory on
    this image" and "no memory on some other image").

Example 3: Consider the program

  Program m206c7e3
    Use Iso_Fortran_Env
    Implicit None
    Real, Allocatable :: x(:)[:]
    Integer :: me[*],i
    Integer stat
    me = This_Image()
    If (Num_Images()<3) Error Stop 'Need at least 3 images'
    If (me==1) Then
      Call do_something_that_takes_a_very_long_time
    End If
    Allocate(x(100)[*],Stat=stat)               !***G
    !
    If (stat==0) Error Stop 'INCONCEIVABLE'
    !
    Do i=1,Num_Images()
      If (me[i]/=i) Error Stop 'me not right?'  !***H
    End Do
  End Program

Let us imagine that the processor operates some form of "timeout"
mechanism, for example, if an image fails to reach a synchronization
point within an hour of the first image reaching that statement, an
error is returned.  (If the slow image subsequently reaches that
statement, one might conjecture that it will also get an error, but
probably STAT_YOU_ARE_TOO_SLOW rather than STAT_TIMEOUT).

In the example above, let us assume that the ALLOCATE statement
commented "!***G" fails, e.g. with a timeout error as we imagined above.

Q3. After resolution of question 1, which images are synchronized
    after execution of an ALLOCATE statement that fails?  That is,
    is execution of the statements commented "!***B" (in Q1), "!***F"
    (in Q2) and "!***H" (above) permitted, or are they impermissible
    references to variables in unordered segments?

    In the case of "!***B", one might conjecture that all the
    non-stopped images are synchronized.

    In the case of "!***F" the text of the standard appears to require
    that image 1 has to wait for all the other images, but it might
    equally be conjectured that that is a mistake and that since it
    knows straightaway that it cannot satisfy the memory allocation it
    should be allowed to return straightaway without synchronizing,
    i.e. the "!***F" is not allowed.

    In the case of "!***H", image 1 has still not even reached the
    ALLOCATE statement (after an hour of the others waiting), so it
    would seem that it is impossible for it to have synchronized as
    required by the standard, and therefore that (for i==1 at least)
    the execution of "!***H" is not allowed.

Q4. When allocation of a coarray is involved, and an error occurs
    (e.g. as in the examples above, plus other cases), under what
    situations does the coarray in question become allocated?

    In particular, can a coarray be allocated on some images but not
    others?  If the answer is that the coarray never becomes
    allocated, that means that in the case of a stopped image, the
    remaining images cannot allocate any coarray.

Q5. Do the answers to Q1-Q4 also apply to DEALLOCATE statements?

ANSWER:

A1. In the case of stopped images, the requirement in 6.7.1.2 was only
    intended to apply to the non-stopped images.  An edit is provided
    to correct this mistake.

A2. Allocation of a coarray was intended only to succeed if it
    succeeds on all images.  An edit is provided to add this missing
    requirement.
(A2 continuation)
    There was not intended to be any requirement that a nonzero STAT=
    value be the same on each image.  No edit is provided to add such
    a requirement.

A3. After execution of an ALLOCATE statement that returns an error
    other than STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE, there was not intended to be any
    requirement for synchronization.  An edit is provided to correct
    this mistake.

A4. The coarray can become allocated on an image if and only if it can
    become allocated on all other images.  An edit is provided to add
    this requirement.  The consequence in the case of a stopped image
    is indeed that no image can subsequently change the allocation
    status of any coarray.

A5. Yes, the answers also apply to DEALLOCATE statements.

TITLE: Are the changes to C_LOC in the 2010 revision intentional?
KEYWORDS: C_LOC, interoperability
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 4

QUESTION:

The description of C_LOC in the intrinsic module ISO_C_BINDING permits
noninteroperable array arguments that are contiguous, provided the
type and kind are interoperable.  This was not permitted by the
previous revision of ISO/IEC 1539-1, which required all type
parameters to be interoperable (and only exempted allocatable arrays
from the "interoperable variable" requirement); however this is not
listed in the Introduction as a change.

For example, each of the following is apparently permitted as
arguments to C_LOC by the requirements in Fortran 2008 but not in
Fortran 2003:
  CHARACTER(13,C_char),TARGET :: x(100)
  CHARACTER(14,C_char),TARGET :: y
  REAL(C_float),CONTIGUOUS :: dummy1(:)
  INTEGER(C_int),CONTIGUOUS,POINTER :: z(:)
(the CONTIGUOUS attribute does not exist in Fortran 2003).
and also
  REAL(C_float) :: dummy2(:)
  INTEGER(C_int),POINTER :: z2(:)
when dummy1 is argument-associated with a contiguous array, and z2 is
pointer-associated with a contiguous array.

Was this change intended?

ANSWER:

Yes, this change was intentional.  An edit is provided to add this to
the Introduction.

     the argument of the function C_LOC in the intrinsic module

TITLE: Can a procedure pointer be declared with an interface block?
KEYWORDS: procedure pointer, interface block
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 4

QUESTION:

Consider the program

  PROGRAM c11
    INTERFACE
      REAL FUNCTION F()
      END FUNCTION
    END INTERFACE
    POINTER F
    EXTERNAL G
    F => G
    PRINT *,F()
  END PROGRAM
  REAL FUNCTION G()
    G = 206
  END FUNCTION

According to 12.4.3.2 paragraph 5, F is an external procedure (and
seems to be missing).  There is no mention of the possibility of a
procedure pointer in the subclause on interface blocks.

Is this intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

Yes, this is intended to be standard-conforming.
An edit is supplied to correct the mistake in 12.4.3.2.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[281:26] In 12.4.3.2 Interface block, paragraph 5,
  After "specific interface for an external procedure"
  change "or a dummy procedure"
  to     ", dummy procedure, or procedure pointer".
{Add procedure pointer for the list of things this can declare.}

[281:25-28] Same paragraph,
  After "interface body, the procedure is a dummy procedure"
  change "; otherwise"
  to ".  If the procedure has the POINTER attribute, it is a
      procedure pointer.  If it is not a dummy procedure or
      procedure pointer".
{Correct how we establish what it is.}

This makes that whole paragraph read:

  An interface body in a generic or specific interface block specifies
  the EXTERNAL attribute and an explicit specific interface for an
  external procedure, dummy procedure, or procedure pointer.  If the
  name of the declared procedure is that of a dummy argument in the
  subprogram containing the interface body, the procedure is a dummy
  procedure.  If the procedure has the POINTER attribute, it is a
  procedure pointer.  If it is not a dummy procedure or
  procedure pointer, it is an external procedure.

{Note careful wording to avoid saying that a dummy procedure is not a
 procedure pointer, since a dummy procedure pointer is indeed both a
 dummy procedure and a procedure pointer.}

QUESTION:

Does the following program conform to the 2008 standard?

program P
  integer, allocatable :: I(:)
  call s ( i )
contains
  subroutine S ( A )
    integer, intent(in), optional :: A(:)
    if ( present(a) ) then
      print *, 'A = ', a

    end if
  end subroutine S
end program P

Subclause 6.7.1.3 says, concerning an unallocated allocatable variable,
"It shall not be supplied as an actual argument corresponding to a
nonallocatable dummy argument, except to certain intrinsic inquiry
functions."

On the other hand, subclause 12.5.2.12 says a dummy argument "is not
present if the dummy argument ... does not have the ALLOCATABLE ...
attribute, and corresponds to an actual argument that ... has the
ALLOCATABLE attribute and is not allocated...."

ANSWER:

The intent was that the program conforms, and prints "A is not present",
as specified by subclause 12.5.2.12.  Edits are provided to correct this
mistake.

TITLE: Vector subscripted actual makes VALUE dummy undefinable?
KEYWORDS: VALUE, definable, vector subscript
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 4

QUESTION:

12.5.2.4p18 [295:3-4] says
  "If the actual argument is an array section having a vector
   subscript, the dummy argument is not definable and shall not have
   the ASYNCHRONOUS, INTENT (OUT), INTENT (INOUT), or VOLATILE
   attributes."

This would seem to be a strange requirement when the dummy argument
has the VALUE attribute (and so is not argument-associated with the
actual argument anyway).

Consider

  program P1
    real :: X(3)
    call S1 ( X ( [ 1, 3, 2 ] ) )
  contains
    subroutine S1 ( A )
      real, value :: A(:)
      A = 3
      print *, A
    end subroutine
  end program

and

  PROGRAM p2
    REAL :: x(3) = [ 10,20,30 ]
    OPEN(10,ASYNCHRONOUS='YES',FORM='UNFORMATTED')
    CALL s2( x( [ 1,2,2,1 ] ) )
  CONTAINS
    SUBROUTINE s2(a2)
      REAL,VALUE,ASYNCHRONOUS :: a2(:)
      READ(10,ASYNCHRONOUS='YES') a2
      PRINT *,'reading...'
      WAIT(10)
      PRINT *,a2
    END SUBROUTINE
  END PROGRAM

Are these two programs standard-conforming?  In particular, is the
assignment to A permitted in S1, and is the dummy argument a2
permitted to have the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute in s2.

ANSWER:

These two programs were intended to be standard-conforming.  Subclause
12.5.2.3 states that a VALUE dummy argument is associated with a
definable data object and not with the actual argument.  An edit is
supplied to correct this mistake.

TITLE: Argument correspondence with VALUE and ASYNCHRONOUS
KEYWORDS: VALUE, ASYNCHRONOUS, coindexed, contiguous
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 4

QUESTION:

Consider the following three programs and discussions:

program P1
  real, asynchronous :: X[*]
  call S1 ( X [ 1 ] )
contains
  subroutine S1 ( A )
    real, value, asynchronous :: A
    a = 3
  end subroutine S1
end program P1

Program P1 appears to violate C1238 which says
  "An actual argument that is a coindexed object with the ASYNCHRONOUS
   or VOLATILE attribute shall not correspond to a dummy argument that
   has either the ASYNCHRONOUS or VOLATILE attribute."
but the dummy argument is not associated with the actual argument so
it is unclear why that should be the case.

program P2
  real, asynchronous :: X(3)
  call S2A ( X )
contains
  subroutine S2A ( A )
    real, asynchronous :: A(:)
    call S2B ( A(1:3) )
  end subroutine S2A
  subroutine S2B ( A )
    real, value, asynchronous, contiguous :: A(:)
    a = 3
  end subroutine S2B
end program P2

This appears to violate C1239 which says
  "If an actual argument is a nonpointer array that has the
   ASYNCHRONOUS or VOLATILE attribute but is not simply contiguous
   (6.5.4), and the corresponding dummy argument has either the
   VOLATILE or ASYNCHRONOUS attribute, that dummy argument shall be an
   assumed-shape array that does not have the CONTIGUOUS attribute."
but again, it is unclear why that should matter for a VALUE dummy
argument.

program P3
  real, target :: X(3)
  real, pointer, asynchronous :: Y(:)
  y => x
  call S3 ( y )
contains
  subroutine S3 ( A )
    real, value, asynchronous, contiguous :: A(:)
    a = 3
  end subroutine S3
end program P3

This program appears to violate C1240 which says
  "If an actual argument is an array pointer that has the ASYNCHRONOUS
   or VOLATILE attribute but does not have the CONTIGUOUS attribute,
   and the corresponding dummy argument has either the VOLATILE or
   ASYNCHRONOUS attribute, that dummy argument shall be an array
   pointer or an assumed-shape array that does not have the CONTIGUOUS
   attribute."
but it is unclear why this should matter for a VALUE dummy argument.

Are those programs intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

Yes, all those programs were intended to be standard-conforming.
There is no need for those constraints to apply to dummy arguments
with the VALUE attribute, because a VALUE dummy argument is not
associated with the actual argument but with an anonymous definable
data object.

Edits are supplied to correct the mistakes in the constraints.

TITLE: Result of TRANSFER when MOLD is an array with element size zero
KEYWORDS: TRANSFER, zero-sized scalar
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 4

QUESTION:

Consider the following examples:

Example 1:
  CHARACTER(0),PARAMETER :: nothing1(100) = ''
  PRINT *,SIZE(TRANSFER(111014,nothing1))

Example 2:
   TYPE empty
   END TYPE
   ! When the physical representation of empty() has size zero;
   ! this is not required but does seem to be permitted.
   TYPE(empty),PARAMETER :: nothing2(1) = empty()
   PRINT *,SIZE(TRANSFER(111014,nothing2))

Example 3:
   TYPE nonempty
     REAL c(0)
   END TYPE
   TYPE(nonempty),PARAMETER :: nothing3(0) = nonempty(0.0)
   PRINT *,SIZE(TRANSFER(111014,nothing3))

According to Fortran 2008, 13.7.168, the result of TRANSFER in this
case is an array of rank one whose
  "size is as small as possible such that its physical representation
   is not shorter than that of SOURCE".
However, the size of a zero-length character is zero and the size of
the above derived types may be zero, no matter how many array elements
there are, so these examples do not seem to be well-defined.

Also consider the following examples, with nothing1 defined as in
example 1.

Example 4:
  CHARACTER(0) :: source1 = ''
  PRINT *,SIZE(TRANSFER(source1,nothing1))

Example 5:
  CHARACTER(999) :: source2(0) = REPEAT('!',999)
  PRINT *,SIZE(TRANSFER(source2,nothing1))

In these cases the physical representation of an element of MOLD has
size zero, but then so does the physical representation of the SOURCE
argument.  According to the quoted text, that would mean that TRANSFER
should return a zero-sized array, i.e. the examples will print zero.

Example 6:
  CHARACTER(*),INTENT(IN) :: maybe_nothing(:) ! A dummy argument.
  CHARACTER(999) :: source3(0) = REPEAT('!',999)
  PRINT *,SIZE(TRANSFER(source3,maybe_nothing))

Example 7:
  CHARACTER(*),INTENT(IN) :: maybe_nothing(:) ! A dummy argument.
  CHARACTER(999) :: source4(10) = REPEAT('!',999)
  PRINT *,SIZE(TRANSFER(source4,maybe_nothing))

In these examples, the physical representation of MOLD is not known at
compile time, but depends on the length of the dummy argument.  Using
the analysis above, example 6 would seem to be conforming (and print
zero), while example 7 would seem to be conforming if and only if the
length of maybe_nothing is nonzero at execution time.

Which of the examples are conforming?  If any of examples 1-3 are
conforming, what value is printed?

ANSWER:

Example 1 is not conforming, and if the derived types have size zero
in examples 2 and 3, those examples are also not conforming, as no
interpretation is established for them.  An edit is provided to
clarify that they are not valid.

Examples 4-6 are conforming, and the value zero is printed.

Example 7 is conforming if and only if the length of maybe_nothing is
not zero.  The same edit clarifies that the zero-length case is not
valid.

QUESTION:

Consider the following code:

    module mod_a
      implicit none
      type, abstract :: t_a
       contains
         procedure(p_a), deferred :: p
      end type t_a
      abstract interface
         subroutine p_a(this, q)
           import :: t_a
           class(t_a), intent(inout) :: this
           class(*), intent(in) :: q
         end subroutine
      end interface
    end module mod_a

    submodule(mod_a) imp_p_a
      type, extends(t_a) :: t_imp
         real :: b
      contains
         procedure :: p => psub ! (A)
      end type t_imp
    contains
      subroutine psub(this, q)
        class(t_imp), intent(inout) :: this
        class(*), intent(in) :: q
        ... ! don't care
      end subroutine psub
    end submodule imp_p_a

Constraint C465 in 10-007r1 reads

"C465 (R448) The procedure-name shall be the name of an accessible
      module procedure or an external procedure that has an explicit
      interface."

Therefore it would appear that statement (A) above is not standard
conforming since PSUB is not the name of a module procedure.

Q1. Is this correct?

If so, extension of a derived type with a deferred type-bound
procedure cannot be done within the specification part of a submodule.

Q2. Was this intended?

ANSWER:

A1. No, this is not correct.  A module procedure is a procedure that
    is defined by a module subprogram (1.3.112.4).  A submodule
    program unit contains a module-subprogram-part (R1116), and this
    contains a (possibly-empty) sequence of module-subprogram's
    (R1107).  Therefore, PSUB is defined by a module subprogram and
    is therefore a module procedure.  Therefore, the statement that
    is commented "(A)" is standard-conforming.

ANSWER:

A1. This is not permitted, as it violates the requirement in 7.2.1.2

    the variable (in an intrinsic assignment statement) is coindexed,
    its deferred length type parameters shall be the same as the

    There is a grammatical error in this requirement; an edit is
    supplied to correct the grammatical error.

A2. This was intended to be permitted, but was inadvertently caught in

QUESTION:

Consider

    MODULE m207c006
      TYPE string(n)
        INTEGER,LEN :: n
        CHARACTER(n) :: v
      END TYPE

        var(2) = string(n)('abcdefgh')
        PRINT *,sf(1),sf(2)
      END SUBROUTINE
    END PROGRAM

If this is conforming, it would appear that the output ought to be
  123abc
  1234567abcdefg

However, for the following reasons, perhaps this is not intended to be
conforming.

(1) A statement function of type character is required to have a
    constant length type parameter.  There is no such requirement on a
    statement function of parameterized derived type.  This seems
    inconsistent, since one can wrap a variable-length character
    in a parameterized derived type.

(2) A statement function is not permitted to invoke a nonintrinsic
    function that requires an explicit interface (and having a PDT
    result requires an explicit interface), nor is it permitted to
    contain a structure constructor.  This would seem to render such a
    statement function almost completely useless, since all it can do
    is to choose between PDT constants or variables, or use an
    intrinsic function such as TRANSFER to construct the result.

(3) Statement functions were declared to be obsolescent long before
    the addition of parameterized derived types to the standard.  It
    has been general policy not to "improve" obsolescent features.
    This would seem to indicate that statement functions were not
    intended to be capable of having parameterized derived type in the
    first place.

Q1. Are statement functions of parameterized derived type intended to
    be conforming?

Q2. If so, are statement functions of parameterized derived type with
    nonconstant length type parameters intended to be conforming?

Q3. If so, is the expected output from the example program above as
    described?

ANSWER:

A1. No, statement functions were not intended to be permitted to be of
    parameterized derived type.  The exception for statement functions
    from the explicit interface requirements was overlooked.  An edit
    is provided to prohibit these.

Yes.  Permitting such extension would require the implementation to

The type declaration statement with INTENT(OUT) causes the

allowed.

TITLE: Can initial-data-target be coindexed?
KEYWORDS: initialization, pointers, coarrays
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 4

QUESTION:

In pointer assignment, the standard is quite clear that data-target
cannot be coindexed:

C725 (R737) A data-target shall not be a coindexed object.

And there are a couple of notes related to this:

NOTE 7.45
A data pointer and its target are always on the same image. A coarray
may be of a derived type with pointer or allocatable subcomponents. For
example, if PTR is a pointer component, Z[P]%PTR is a reference to the
target of component PTR of Z on image P. This target is on image P and
its association with Z[P]%PTR must have been established by the
execution of an ALLOCATE statement or a pointer assignment on image P.

NOTE 7.46
A pointer assignment statement is not permitted to involve a coindexed
pointer or target, see C723 and C725. This prevents a pointer
assignment statement from associating a pointer with a target on
another image. If such an association would otherwise be implied, the
association status of the pointer becomes undefined. For example, a
derived-type intrinsic assignment where the variable and expr are on
different images and the variable has an ultimate pointer component.

Fortran 2008 added the ability to specify an initial-data-target in
pointer initialization:

R505 initialization is = constant-expr
                    or => null-init
                    or => initial-data-target
R506 null-init      is function-reference

C510 (R503) If => appears in initialization, the entity shall have the
POINTER attribute. If = appears in initialization, the entity shall not
have the POINTER attribute.

C511 (R503) If initial-data-target appears, object-name shall be
data-pointer-initialization compatible with it (4.5.4.6).

Initial-data-target is defined in 4.5.4.6 and the only relevant
constraint for it is:

C461 (R443) The designator shall designate a nonallocatable variable
that has the TARGET and SAVE attributes and does not have a vector
subscript. Every subscript, section subscript, substring starting
point, and substring ending point in designator shall be a constant
expression.

The definition of "data-pointer-initialization compatible" is:

"A pointer variable or component is data-pointer-initialization
compatible with a target if the pointer is type compatible with the
target, they have the same rank, all nondeferred type parameters of the
pointer have the same values as the corresponding type parameters of
the target, and the target is contiguous if the pointer has the
CONTIGUOUS attribute."

Given this, is initializing a pointer to a coindexed object permitted?

For example:

program test
integer, save, target :: C[*]
integer, pointer :: P => C[3] ! Permitted?
end

While ordinary pointer assignment to a coindexed object is prohibited
by C725, there is no corresponding constraint prohibiting such
association by way of data pointer initialization.

Note that 16.5.2.5p1(2) says that pointer-assigning to a target on a
different image causes the pointer to become undefined. Since the
initialization occurs on all images, and it's not possible to restrict
the target to only the same image, the effect would be to make a
program that does this nonconforming.

ANSWER:

No, this was not intended to be permitted. A clarifying edit is
provided.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[70:3] 4.5.4.6

In the first sentence of C461, insert ", noncoindexed" after
"nonallocatable" so that the sentence reads:

C461 (R443) The designator shall designate a nonallocatable,
noncoindexed variable that has the TARGET and SAVE attributes and
does not have a vector subscript.

According to 7.2.1.2 Intrinsic assignment statement, an assignment
statement is an intrinsic assignment statement if (and only if) it
is not a defined assignment statement.  According to 7.2.1.4 Defined
assignment statement, a defined assignment statement needs to have a
subroutine that defines the assignment "x1 = x2".  For elemental
subroutines (item (5)(b)), that is true only if
  "x1 and x2 are conformable"
which when x1 and x2 are both arrays, means "has the same shape".
For the example above, in the assignment marked (A), x and y will be
conformable (as both n and n2 are equal to 10), making that a defined
assignment, thus the PRINT statement after it would print
 -1.0 -2.0 -3.0 -4.0 -5.0 -6.0 -7.0 -8.0 -9.0 -10.0
while in the assignment statement marked (B), y and z will not be
conformable (n2 being 10 and m being 13), making it an intrinsic
assignment.  In this case, because Y is allocatable it will be
reallocated, and so the output from the second PRINT statement would
be
 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 7.0 8.0 9.0 10.0 11.0 12.0 13.0

However, this would seem to violate the fundamental principle that
generic references are resolvable at compile time.  It would also
seem to be nearly useless since if the variable is not allocatable
the shapes are required to conform anyway.

Is this feature intended to work like this?

ANSWER:

No, this was a mistake.  Edits are provided to remove the runtime
generic resolution.

After the edits:
  1) The assignment A is defined assignment and is conforming (from 
     first edit).

  2) The assignment B is defined assignment but is not standard conforming,
     since the shapes differ (from second edit).
 
  3) For a defined assignment statement, auto-reallocation of 
     allocatables does not occur, as that is only done by an intrinsic 
     assignment statement.

[24:11+] 1.6.2 Fortran 2003 compatibility, insert new incompatibility
  "Fortran 2003 interpreted assignment to an allocatable variable
   from a nonconformable array as intrinsic assignment, even when an
   elemental defined assignment was in scope; this part of ISO/IEC
   1539 does not permit assignment from a nonconformable array in
   this context.".
{The unintended extension is weird and violates our own principles,
 but is not in itself contradictory or ambiguous so this is an
 incompatibility.}

[157:14] 7.2.1.4 Defined assignment statement, p2, item (5)(b),
         Change "$x_1$ and $x_2$ are conformable"
         to "$x_2$ is scalar or has the same rank as $x_1$".
{$x_1$ is TeX for italics x subscript 1.}

[157:16] Same subclause, p3, append new sentence
  "If the subroutine is elemental, $x_2$ shall have the same shape as
   $x_1$."
{Retain conformability as a normal requirement instead of as a
 condition.}

NUMBER: F08/0148
TITLE: Pointer subobject in structure constructor in pure procedure
KEYWORDS: pointer subobject, structure constructor, pure procedure
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: In F2008 Corrigendum 4

QUESTION:

Consider the module

program P

  type :: T1
    integer, pointer :: P1
  end type T1

  type :: T2
    type(t1) :: P2
  end type T2

  type(t1), target :: V1

  allocate ( V1%p1, source = 42 )

contains

  pure subroutine S ( )
    type(t2) :: A
  1 a = t2(v1)
    a%p2%p1 = a%p2%p1 + 1
  end subroutine S

end program P

Item (3) in the list in constraint C1283 in subclause 12.7 prohibits
an object that is accessed by host or use association (and other
categories) to be the <expr> in a structure constructor that
corresponds to a component that has the POINTER attribute.  It is
silent concerning type constructors for types that have potential
subobject components with the POINTER attribute.

Is the statement labeled 1 permitted?  If so, was that intended?

ANSWER:

The statement labeled 1 was inadvertently allowed because V1
corresponds to a component of the structure constructor for type T2
that does not have the POINTER attribute.

An edit is provided to correct this mistake.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[312:35 12.7p2 C1283(3)] Replace this list item by
  "(3) as the <expr> corresponding to a component in a
       <structure-constructor> if the component has the POINTER
       attribute or has a pointer component at any level of
       component selection,"
