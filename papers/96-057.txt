Given the following declarations:

real, target  :: b(0:9)
real, pointer :: a(:), b_first(:), b_last(:)

The situation with Fortran 95 is:

     a => b                  ! bounds are (0:9)
     a => b(:)               ! bounds are (1:10)
     b_first => b(0:4)       ! bounds are (1:5)
     b_last => b(5:9)        ! bounds are (1:5)

There is no way for the user to alter this determination of bounds.

PROPOSAL A  One proposal would be to add an optional lower bound
specifier to the left side of the pointer assignment statement.
Then a user would be able to write:

     a(0:) => b              ! bounds are (0:9)
     a(0:) => b(:)           ! bounds are (0:9)
     b_first(0:) => b(0:4)   ! bounds are (0:4)
     b_last(5:) => b(5:9)    ! bounds are (5:9)
     b_last(0:) => b(5:9)    ! bounds are (0:4)


PROPOSAL B  An alternate proposal would, in addition, make a change to
Fortran 95 such that unless a lower bound is specified, it is 1.  This
is a simple rule to remember.  It would have the following effect:

     a => b                  ! bounds are (1:10)     CHANGE
     a => b(:)               ! bounds are (1:10)
     a(0:) => b              ! bounds are (0:9)
     a(0:) => b(:)           ! bounds are (0:9)
     ...

Changing the standard at this time is a drastic step (even though this
is a small change), and would require an explanation in section 1.5.
Why should it even be considered?  It is true the rule would be simpler,
but also the language would be more consistent.  Argument association
is comparable to pointer assignment:

     real b(0:9)
     call sub(b)
     ...
     subroutine sub(x)   ! This has the same effect as x => b(:)
        real x(:)        ! The bounds of x are 1:10
        ...
     end

The rule for argument association is that x has the bounds (1:extent)
unless a lower bound is specified in the declaration for x, for example

     real b(0:9)
     call sub(b)
     ...
     subroutine sub(x)    ! This has the same effect as x(0:) => b
        real x(0:)        ! The bounds of x are (0:9)
        ...
     end

If the language were changed, there would be only one rule for both
argument association and pointer assignment:  Rule: The bounds are
1:extent  unless a lower bound other than 1 is specified.  Is this a
good enough reason to change the standard?
