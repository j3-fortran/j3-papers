Aleks split the comments into several categories:
1) Simple editorial corrections
2) Requests to clarify or change wording
3) Things I am confused about (these may be technical issues)
These do not include issues concerning co-arrays and responses to
Internal Notes.

Subgroup A recommends all the edits below EXCEPT those marked REJECTED
above and below the numbered item.  Only read the 1st 18 items, subgroup
did not process the rest of the paper.
_________________________________
Editorial corrections
_________________________________

1.
[xv: Shouldn't the "G0" edit descriptor be added to the list of
new features?

2.
[11:52] Replace "anywhere that any" with "anywhere a"

3. REJECTED
[20:25] I believe "rectangular" only applies for two dimensional
patterns. See also [119:11].
   REJECTED

4.
[33:19] <macro-optional-decl-stmt> is not formatted properly

5.
[33:27] Replace "it shall be" with "<macro-expr> shall be"

6.
[35:28] The phrase "physically replaced" seems inappropriate. Simply
"replaced"?

7.
[39:] In Note 3.14, there is a MACRO missing from in front of the DO and
END DO statements.

8.
[65:2-3] After "disassociated", add "or associated with specific
targets"

9.
[65:27] Add "and" before "does not have"

10.
[88:17+] In Note 5.8, split the line before the second REAL

11. REJECTED
[90:14-15] Delete the sentence "The value of a lower...may be positive,
negative, or zero"---it seems tautological.
    REJECTED

12.
[90:21] Add "non-allocatable" before "nonpointer"

13.
[91:22] Add space in "ofa"

14.
[94:?] In Note 5.16, second line of second para, delete "there is
any possibility that".

15.
[117:14] Shouldn't C616 refer to R612, not R613?

Yes.  [117:14] Replace ‘R613’ by ‘R612’.

16.  REJECTED
[120:9] I believe the initial "Exactly one <part-ref> shall have
nonzero rank" is needless duplication of C617.
     REJECTED

17.
[124:25,30] Replace "SOURCE=" with “<source-expr>”. MOLD= is also a
perfectly acceptable way to specify the dynamic type.

Note to Editor: fixup SOURCE/MOLD in this section, if this edit isn’t sufficient.

18.
[158:30] Fix the formatting problem with <expr> (upside down !?)

END OF EDITS RECOMMENDED BY SUBGROUP A (we ran out of time).  No edits
beyond this point will be recommended by subgroup at meeting 177.

Changes of wording
_________________________________

1.
[22:4] The first sentence does not include the newly added ability
to perform pointer association via explicit initialization or default
initialization.

2.
[34:36-37] C313 needs to be rewritten so that it does not have three
negatives:
"If the first token is MACRO the second token shall be not be a
keyword or name."
Can the first <result-token> be DEFINE or EXPAND? If yes, then why are
these separate items in the BNF for R322? I would have thought that a
body statement cannot be any of the special macro statements, namely
anything starting with MACRO and also DEFINE MACRO and EXPAND. As a
specific example, can a macro define a macro with a variable number
of arguments, where the number of arguments is an argument of the
top-level macro?

3. There is a clear provision for macros defining macros. Here is
an attempt at an example of using such a macro---to be included in
a Note or Annex C:

---------
! Macro that defines a macro which assigns a value to an array element
DEFINE MACRO :: assign_shortcut(rank)
   DEFINE MACRO assign_%%rank(array,indices,value)
      MACRO INTEGER :: i
      array(indices(1)&&
      MACRO DO i=2,rank
           ,indices(i)&&
      MACRO END DO
            )=value
   END MACRO assign_%%rank
END MACRO assign_shortcut

! Create assignment macros for all ranks
MACRO DO i=1,15
   EXPAND assign_shortcut(i)
MACRO END DO

! Now use the rank-3 assignment macro:
REAL, ALLOCATABLE :: A(:,:,:)
INTEGER :: indices(3)=...
EXPAND assign_3(A,indices,5.0)
---------

4.
[37:1] I find "statement-dependent" in item (3) too vague---maybe say
"Macro statement processing". The expansion of macros is in a sense
iterative, expanding MACRO and EXPAND statements until there are
none left to expand. This was not really clear to me from reading
the description.

5.
[38:20] I believe that we should be specific that token replacement
and concatenation are the ONLY forms of expansion that occur.

6.
[86:12+] In Note 5.3, replace the end "in a module where it is PRIVATE"
with "that module".

7.
[79:11+] Near the end of Note 4.66, the phrase "interoperable
values" which I don't think is defined. Maybe "the types will be
interoperable"?

8.
[87:19] I find it very weird that the "not the real or imaginary
part..." is separated at the top, before the list. It should go under
arrays section.

9.
[89:5] I believe what this is trying to say is that "a co-array shall
not be a constant or a function result". This seems clearer and more
specific to me.

10.
[89:7+] In Note 5.10 delete "on an image" from "allocated on an image"

11.
[89:15+] In Note 5.11, we should add an example of an assumed-size
array and also clarify that the array pointer and allocatable examples
are deferred-shape arrays.

12.
[117:2] We should change the term "structure component" since it
can be read to mean "component of a structure" rather than being
a made-up term. A structure is scalar, but "structure component"
can be an array. I find this very weird and confusing.

13.
[117:11] We need an equivalent to C614 for the <image-selector>. At
present this seems to be a plain restriction (non constraint) at
[123:5].

14.
[126:15] Shouldn't we add "as if via intrinsic assignment" or something
alike to the end of the paragraph. The current phrasing "the value of
<allocate-object> becomes that of <source-expr>" does not seem to make
sense for the case when <source-expr> is scalar and <allocate-object>
an array.

15.
[145:13-21] Is very repetitive---it would be useful to rewrite it.

16.
[164:35] Here we say "LBOUND applied to the corresponding dimension of
data-target". For intrinsic assignment we say "corresponding element
of LBOUND(<bnf>)". We should be consistent. See also [181:23].

17.
[165:?] In Note 7.49, we should add an example of rank-remapping
using CONTIGUOUS. Something like:

REAL, CONTIGUOUS, POINTER :: A(:)
REAL, CONTIGUOUS, TARGET :: B(:,:) ! Dummy argument
A(1:SIZE(B))=>B ! Flatten a rank-2 array

_________________________________
Technical questions
_________________________________

1.
[56:8] Is "ultimate component of a type" well-defined? We have
subcomponents of an object, and ultimate components of an object. How
about of a type? This is important because we have used this phrase
heavily, especially for co-arrays.

2.
[84:23] Why not replace the BNF <function-reference> with NULL()
and get rid of C512?

3.
[87:5] Can one please give me an example of a procedure declaration
with the BIND(C) attribute? Also for 307:3. It seems to me that an
explicit interface is always required. Isn't that interface required
to specify BIND(C) already? Is it allowed to add a binding label
via a separate BIND statement? This seems to cause considerable
complications, for example, 307:28-29 and 307:39-43, without any
benefit?

4.
[88:17] Isn't non_contiguous_array%component always non-contiguous?

5.
[120:1] We had an e-mail discussion about the "does not require the
shape". A subroutine reference such as:
CALL Subroutine(assumed_size_dummy%component)
does not "require" the shape of assumed_size, yet we want to
prohibit it.

6.
[133:18] I believe we should add a constraint prohibiting an
expression primary that is a co-indexed object with pointer ultimate
components. Parenthesizing such an expression would require making a
local copy of the object, which is not allowed if there are pointer
components.
Answer: "<data-ref> covers this.
