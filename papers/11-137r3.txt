INTRODUCTION:

This paper collects (with one exception) the minor comments from
N1844 that are not already covered in other papers.
(The exception is a comment on section 5.2.7 para 1 which needs a
 separate paper since it may involve a technical change).

EDITS to N1838:

[5:11] Change "the bounds" to "the rank and bounds".

[5:21+]   Delete NOTE 3.1
          {Similar content is added in paper 11-142r1.}

[9:30]    Add period at line end.

[11:3] Replace "is equal to (CFI_index_t)-2" with "shall have the
value -2." {Note to Editor: Create a minus two with $-2$.}

[14:3-5]    Replace paragraph 1 of 5.2.6.1 Functions/General with

"The functions described in this subclause and the structure of the C
descriptor provide a C function with the capability to interoperate
with a Fortran procedure that has an allocatable, assumed character
length, assumed-rank, assumed-shape, or data pointer argument."

[14:7-8]  Replace "Pointer objects" by "A Fortran pointer".

[15:12] Delete comma after "void *" and the space after "CFI_cdesc_t *".

[15:39]   Add comma after "pointer".

[16:14] Change "while the members of the descriptor are capable of
being referenced" to "while the descriptor represents the object".

[17:17-19] Delete 5.3 [The contents of 5.2.6.7 and 5.2.7 make this
        redundant.]

[20:4] Change "the shape" to "the rank, shape,".
