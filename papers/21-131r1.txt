PL22.3 Programming Language Fortran Task Group

March 2, 2021

InterNational Committee for Information Technology Standards (INCITS)
Secretariat: Information Technology Industry Council (ITI)
1101 K Street NW, Suite 610, Washington, DC 20005

Dear INCITS Secretariat:

The PL22.3 Task Group would like to recommend Van Snyder for consideration
of Emeritus Member.

Van joined the Committee in February 1997 at a joint X3J3/WG5 meeting and
was a contributing member throughout his membership. Van represented the
NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory on PL22.3 and retired from there on October
2, 2020. His last PL22.3 meeting was February 2020.

Van has made significant contributions to advancements of the Fortran
language since he joined and has been involved in the evolution of Fortran
from FORTRAN 77 to today's current standard Fortran 2018. Van meticulously
read and re-read the drafts and standards time and time again, and found
countless flaws and editorial opportunities, which improved the quality and
consistency of the standard.

Please consider Van Snyder for Emeritus Member status in the PL22.3
Programming Language Fortran Task Group.

Sincerely,

Brian Friesen
Chair, PL22.3
