Subject: Edits for R.6a -- Inheritance

Edits refer to 98-007r1.  Remarks for the editor are in {}.
Some minor changes to the syntax in 97-196r2 are:
   (1) OBJECT -> CLASS
   (2) The run-time type of a disassociated polymorphic pointer is the same
       as its declared type (previously undefined).  This seems more useful,
       and it would have been difficult to describe a NULL() intrinsic
       returning a pointer with no type.
   (3) The intrinsic enquiry functions no longer require polymorphic actual
       arguments (they are not interesting if both arguments are not
       polymorphic, but it seems unnecessary to restrict them).  Because of
       this the argument keywords are also changed.

Replace [39:3-4] with
      [ <component-def-stmt> ... ]

Replace [39:6] with

"Constraint: A derived type shall not have both the EXTENSIBLE and EXTENDS

"4.5.3 Extensible types

A derived type that has the EXTENSIBLE or EXTENDS attributes is an
<<extensible type>>.

A type that has the EXTENSIBLE attribute is a <<base type>>.
A type that has the EXTENDS attribute is an <<extended type>>.
The <<parent type>> of an extended type is the type named in the EXTENDS
attribute specification.

{Insert note:}Note: A base type is not required to have any components, and
an extended type is not required to have more components than its parent type.

A base type is an <<extension type>> of itself only.  An extended type is an
extension type of itself, its parent type, and of all types for which its
parent is an extension.

An extended type includes all of the components of its parent type. The
components of the parent type are said to be <<inherited>> by the
extended type.  Additional components may be declared.  For purposes of
intrinsic input/output (9.4.2) and value construction ([existing section]
4.5.4), the order of the components of an extended type is the components
inherited from its parent type, followed by the components of the
extended type, in the order declared.

An extended type has a component name that is the same name and has the
same type as its parent type.  This is not an additional component; it
denotes a subobject that has the parent type, and that consists of all of
the components inherited from the parent type.

Note: The subobject denoted by the parent type name has the same
accessibility as the additional components of the extended type, even if
the components of the parent type are not accessible.

A component declared in an extended type shall have neither the same name
as any accessible component of its parent type nor the same name as the
parent type name.

{begin note}Note 4.5.3a
Examples:
  TYPE, EXTENSIBLE :: POINT            ! A base type
    REAL :: X, Y
  END TYPE POINT
  TYPE, EXTENDS(POINT) :: COLOR_POINT  ! An extension of TYPE(POINT)
    ! Components X and Y, and component name POINT, inherited from parent
    INTEGER :: COLOR
  END TYPE COLOR_POINT"

Add [47:42+]
"A <structure-constructor> for an extended type may use a nested form or a
list form.  In the <<nested form>> a single value is provided for the component
that has the same name as the parent type.

In the <<list form>> a separate value is provided for each component of
the parent type.  The list form shall not be used if any components of the
parent type are inaccessible in the scoping unit in which the
<structure-constructor> appears (4.5.1).

                                      ! are accessible here

Add new section [56:16+]
{Add to index and glossary: "declared type", "dynamic type", "polymorphic"}
"5.1.1.8 Polymorphic objects

The CLASS type specifier is used to declare <<polymorphic>> objects.  The type
in the CLASS type specifier is the <<declared type>> of the polymorphic object.

A polymorphic object can, during program execution, assume any derived type
that is in the class of types consisting of the declared type and all its
extension types.  The type assumed at any instant during program execution is
the <<dynamic type>> at that instant.  The dynamic type of a object that is not
polymorphic is the same as its declared type.

Note: Only components of the declared type of a polymorphic object may be
referenced by component selection (6.1.2).

Polymorphic objects assume their dynamic type via argument association
(12.4.1.2), pointer assignment (7.5.2), NULLIFY (6.3.2), or successful
execution  of an ALLOCATE (6.3.1) or DEALLOCATE (6.3.3) statement.

The type of a polymorphic pointer with a pointer association status of
disassociated is the declared type."

Replace at [82:42] "type" with "declared type".

Add [88:22+]
"Allocation of a polymorphic pointer allocates a target whose dynamic type is
the declared type of the pointer."

Add note [91:8+]
"Note: When a NULLIFY statement is applied to a polymorphic pointer ([new
section] 5.1.1.8) its dynamic type becomes the declared type."

Replace [118:32-33] with
   "(2) The dynamic types of <variable> and <expr> are the same derived type,
        <variable> is not polymorphic, and no defined assignment exists for
        objects of this type."

Replace [118:39] "<variable> and <expr> are of the same derived type" with
"<variable> is not polymorphic, the dynamic type of <expr> is the same as the
declared type of <variable>"

Replace [121:25] "types" with "declared types"
and "are the same as" with "are the same as or extension types of".

Replace [122:14-15]
"
Constraint: If <pointer-object> is a data object or a function procedure
            pointer, and neither <pointer-object> nor <target> are
            polymorphic, the <target> shall have the same type as the
            <pointer-object>.

Constraint: If <pointer-object> is polymorphic and <target> is not
            polymorphic, the type of <target> shall be an extension type ([new
            section] 4.5.3) of the declared type of <pointer-object>.

Constraint: If <pointer-object> is a data object or a function procedure
            pointer, the rank and kind type parameters of <target> shall be the
            same as the rank and corresponding kind type parameters of
            <pointer-object>."

Add [122:33+]
"If <pointer-object> is not polymorphic (5.1.1.8) <target> shall have the same
dynamic type as <pointer-object>.

If <pointer-object> or <target> is polymorphic, the dynamic type of <target>
shall be an extension type ([new section] 4.5.3) of the declared type of
<pointer-object>.

If the <pointer-object> is polymorphic, the <pointer-object> assumes the
dynamic type of the <target>."

Add [217:27+]
"(g) A dummy argument that is polymorphic, or"

Replace "If ... object" [225:41] with
"If a dummy argument is a dummy data object that is not polymorphic and the
associated actual argument is not polymorphic,"

Insert the following before ``The kind'' [225:42] and then start a new
paragraph with ``The kind.''

"If a dummy argument or its associated actual argument, or both, are
polymorphic, the dynamic type of the actual argument shall be an extension type
([new section] 4.5.3) of the declared type of the dummy argument.  If the dummy
argument is polymorphic it assumes the dynamic type of the corresponding actual
argument."

Add to the end of the paragraph at [226:10]
"If the dummy argument is a polymorphic pointer, the actual argument shall be
a polymorphic pointer."

Add [227:24+]
"Note: If the dummy argument is not polymorphic and the type of the actual
argument is a extension type of the dummy argument, only the part of the actual
argument that is of the same type as the dummy argument becomes undefined."

Add new section [248:15+]
"13.10 Type inquiry functions

The function SAME_TYPE_AS inquires whether two objects of extensible type ([new
section] 4.5.3) have the same dynamic type. The function EXTENDS_TYPE_OF
inquires whether the dynamic type of one object of extensible type is an
extension type ([new section] 4.5.3) of the dynamic type of another object of
extensible type."

both extensible types, have different base types."

"Components of an object of extensible type that are inherited from the parent
type may be accessed, as a whole, by using the component name that is the same
as the parent type name, or individually, either with or without qualifying
them by the component name that is the same as the parent type name.
For example:

  TYPE, EXTENSIBLE :: POINT            ! A base type
    REAL :: X, Y
  END TYPE POINT
  TYPE, EXTENDS(POINT) :: COLOR_POINT  ! An extension of TYPE(POINT)
