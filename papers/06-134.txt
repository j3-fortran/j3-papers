Subject:     Simplification of the co-array proposal
References:  Feature UK-001, J3/05-208, J3/05-272r2, J3/06-120 J3/06-121,
             J3/06-122, J3/06-129, J3/06-130, J3/06-132

The proposal for adding co-arrays to the language is becoming bloated.  Some
features seem like good ideas but are not essential to the model.  John Reid
and I proposed some of them in our 1998 report and the current proposal J3/06-122
contains several new features.  In addition, several other papers
(for example, J3/06-120, J3/06-121, J3/06-129, J3/06-130, J3/06-132) have suggested
further extensions.  Many of these ideas seriously compromise the
model's simplicity and may discourage vendors who want to implement it.

The underlying philosophy of the co-array programming model is that it is
simple to understand and simple to implement.  It deliberately makes the
programmer responsible for data distribution, data communication, memory
consistency, and explicit synchronization.  It is designed so that existing
compilers and run-time systems can implement it with only minimal new
technology.

The co-array model is not a data-parallel model.  Co-array indices in a
statement have nothing to do with which image executes the statement.

Six basic features define the essence of the model:
(1) a syntax for data distribution;  (2) a syntax for data communication;
(3) a full barrier; (4) a partial barrier between pairs of images; (5) allocatable
co-arrays; and (6) allocatable components of co-array derived types.  Although these
features may not address every problem encountered in parallel applications, they
cover a very large percentage of current practice.  We should be careful adding
complicated features before we have solid implementations of the simple features
and good evidence of what more is needed.

The co-array model is a local model.  It is deliberately designed so
that the compiler is not required to perform global optimization, is not
expected to perform global optimization, and is in fact prevented from
performing global optimization.  Adding anything to the model that requires
the compiler to analyze global information (J3/06-121) destroys the local model,
makes it difficult to implement, and deters the compiler from performing
its more important responsibility for local optimization.

Co-array syntax implies nothing about execution control.  It has been suggested,
that statements containing an explicit co-array reference should somehow be
"optimized" by the compiler (J3/06-130) so that some other image is responsible
 for executing the statement.  It has also been suggested that procedures be 
defined for creation and management of subsets of images (J3/06-121, J3/06-132) 
so that the compiler can optimize predefined communication patterns.  Both 
these ideas are antithetical to the co-array model.  They put too high a burden 
on compiler technology that will defeat adoption of the model. 

As it is, some of the simple features themselves may be difficult for vendors to
implement.  Most systems have no fast barrier mechanism and none
have a fast subset barrier mechanism.  Allocating co-arrays is a hard
problem for many systems.  Allocating components of co-array derived types is
an even harder problem.  Vendors need to focus on these simple problems first
before they diffuse their efforts to even harder problems. 

Looking at the totality of the edits in J3/06-122 has led me to ask J3
(and WG5) to consider the following simplifications, which, by the way, produce a
document approximately half the size of J3/06-122.

1. Delete user-defined ordering constructs (8.5.5 in J3/06-122) and
the SYNC_MEMORY statement.

The SYNC_MEMORY function was part of the 1998 proposal
(Report RAL-TR-1998-060) and was useful then since it provided a basic
building block upon which other co-array features could be built. The
situation changed with the addition of NOTIFY/WAIT (NOTIFY/QUERY in
J3/06-122).

SYNC_MEMORY is difficult to explain and programmers are likely to make errors
using it.  The only examples for a user-defined order construct is a spin-loop,
which waits for a co-array variable to change.  Implementing such spin-loops
efficiently is likely to be a problem for many vendors.  Differences in
implementation from vendor to vender may result in ticking time bombs that go
off in unexpected ways.  It is difficult to understand or debug code using
spin-loops because there is no way of knowing which image is expected to
change the variable.

The QUERY statement effectively spins internally and must be implemented
correctly by each vendor.  The vendor only needs to concentrate on making
the QUERY statement efficient.  The programmer should use it to write portable
code.

I have yet to see an example with a spin-loop that cannot be rewritten with
greater clarity with NOTIFY/QUERY.  It is a strong claim to make that there is
anything that requires a spin-loop that cannot be implemented any other way.

Vendors may want to make spin-loops work as a nonstandard extension.  Let them 
do so. We can monitor the benefits for future consideration.

2. Delete the collective subroutines

The collectives were added hastily in Delft and have changed significantly
since then as the details have been worked out. This seems a good moment to
check that we really do need them.

The collectives in J3/06-122 are not as convenient to use as the
corresponding transformational intrinsics. A note has been added as
C.9a.2 to show how to sum all the elements of a co-array with a local
mask. It offers no masking over the images. To add this would require
the construction of an integer array containing the set of image indices,
perhaps by repeated calls of IMAGE_INDEX.

A further disadvantage is that the set of images that do the work has to
be the same as the set of images that hold the data. One of the design
objectives of co-array Fortran was to allow the separation of work from
data storage.  Why shouldn't all images be able to sum over the second 
co-dimension, for example?

The collectives have been changed to subroutines rather than functions because
there are side effects due to implicit synchronization in the procedures themselves.
These procedures are more naturally defined as functions, for example, s=coSum(a),
where the result can be used in expressions.  Furthermore, there is no reason to
restrict the argument to a co-array variable.  I have found it very annoying to have
to copy a non-co-array variable into a co-array variable before calling a reduction
function.  This copy, if necessary, can be done internally inside the function.
For example, look at the code samples in C.9a.2 of J3/06-122.
 
These procedures belong initially in a support library not included as
intrinsic procedures.  It puts too heavy a burden on the vendors.  It is
unclear what we want them to do.  It is very easy for a programmer to
write a procedure to perform a specific function for a specific type of
co-array.  It is extremely difficult to write procedures for all possible
types of co-arrays and all possible functions.  After we have had some experience
with defining and using the support library, we can reconsider whether these
procedures should be included as intrinsics.

3.  It is not clear to me what the VOLATILE attribute should mean for
co-array variables.  Do we want to say anything at all about the VOLATILE attribute
for co-array variables?  What would they be used for?  What problem would they
solve?  Does it require new compiler technology to implement?  Are they useful only
for spin-loops?  Can VOLATILE be defined in such a way that spin-loops
work without the need for sync_memory?  To me, a natural definition would be that
any reference to or definition of a VOLATILE co-array variable forces the processor
to flush memory, locally and remotely.  It essentially prevents compiler optimization
and it forces co-arrays to be visible to other images.  Such a definition, however,
is different from definitions in other languages that seem to care only
about the right side of assignment statements but not the left side.  For co-array
variable, both sides matter. 

4.  There should be one statement that implements a full barrier for all
images.  It should be called SYNC, or possibly BARRIER, with no arguments.
The optional STAT= and ERRMSG= arguments are not useful and should be
omitted.  The SYNC_IMAGES statement should be deleted.  It is redundant.
Synchronization for a subset of images can be done with NOTIFY/QUERY.
Synchronization using external synchronization procedures, such as
MPI_BARRIER for example, should be non-conforming.  Calls to these
external procedures should be replaced by the conforming SYNC statement.

5.  I raise a cautionary flag about NOTIFY/QUERY, although I don't
really know if there is a problem or not.  This feature was added in haste after
the original 1998 report.  Although paper J3/06-122 contains examples of ways to
use the NOTIFY/QUERY statements, I am uncertain that we have really defined them
correctly. For example, should a NOTIFY be required to match a corresponding QUERY?
Should there be a way to identify which NOTIFY is being matched by a given QUERY?
Are they actually intended to provide the functionality we used to call 
EVENTPOST/EVENTWAIT in other programming models?  Should there be something 
like an event tag attached to NOTIFY/QUERY pairs?  Or should NOTIFY/QUERY be 
attached to objects as in Java? I don't know the answers, but I am uneasy about 
the questions.

6.  We should be very careful about dictating the behavior of a
parallel I/O system.  Following the basic philosophy of the co-array model,
we should make the minimum changes required and no more.  The only problem
seems to be the restriction that a program is allowed to execute the OPEN statement
with the same unit number only once unless there is a intervening CLOSE statement.
I suggest that the minimum change we need to make is to relax this restriction for
direct access mode and use the the notation ACCESS=* to define a shared, direct
access file.  An open statement without ACCESS=* connects the file to the image
that invokes the statement and follows the normal rules.

The only way to get parallel I/O is through direct access mode.  There is nothing 
to be gained by allowing shared files with sequential access mode.  And there is 
much to lose because vendors must alter their implementations of backspace, 
rewind, endfile, and so forth, which do not apply to direct access files.

I propose that we allow shared files only in direct access mode.  We alter the
open statement so that the file descriptor is visible to all images in such a way
that the implementation can handle it locally without sharing global tables if it
wants to.  I suggest the syntax

open(unit=,file=,access=*,recl=,...)

All keywords must be identical on all images and there is an implicit synchronization
for the open statement.  There is also an implicit synchronization for the 
corresponding close statement.  It is not clear to me that there is any real 
advantage connecting a file to a subset of images.  If there is an advantage,
I suggest the syntax ACCESS=connectList(:) to specify the connected images.

Standard input and standard output are special cases.  They are always
connected to all images by default.  Only image one is allowed to read standard
input.  All images are allowed to write to standard output, and the system is
required to make sure the records from different images are not mixed together.

7.  Delete all of Section 8.5.2 from J3/06-122.  The TEAM idea has assumed a 
much larger importance than it deserves.  The programmer can easily form 
teams without making TEAM a formal part of the extension.
On the face of it, the TEAM idea seems to apply to the problem
of coupling together different applications such as ocean and atmosphere
models.  In practice, however, I have been unsuccessful in getting anyone
in the weather or climate modeling community to buy into the idea.
The co-array model was not intended to be a component architecture.  Trying
to make it into one will not work.  New procedures for TEAM creation and TEAM 
management have been suggested (J3/06-132).  Such suggestions do not fit the 
basic philosophy for the co-array model that only the minimum required be 
added to the language.  

8.  Alternative program execution model

The execution sequence on each image is as specified in 2.3.4.

A.  Execution Model

The following statements are called <<segment boundary statements>>.

1.  Program
2.  Sync
3.  Notify([list])
4.  Query([list] [,ready])
5.  Allocate(x[*])
6.  Deallocate(x)
7.  Critical
8.  End Critical
9.  Open(unit=u,access=*)
10. Close(u)
11. End (procedure)
12. Return (procedure)
13. Stop
14. End Program

A <<segment>> is the sequence of statements between two segment boundary statements.
The notation X:Y represents the segment between the two segment boundary
statements X and Y.  A segment may be empty, and it need not contain any executable
statements.
  
On each image, the processor executes the same program, which shall have the
same Program statement and the same End Program statement.
Each image executes independently of the others except possibly at certain
segment boundary statements.

The compiler may apply all normal optimization techniques within a segment.

The processor must complete all memory references to co-arrays that occur
in the sequence of statements that precede a segment boundary statement before
performing whatever action is specified for the segment boundary statement.

The actions performed by the processor at each segment boundary statement are
as follows:

1.  PROGRAM:  The processor immediately processes each statement following the
Program statement according to the normal rules of Fortran.  

2.  SYNC:  The processor suspends execution on each image until all
images have encountered a SYNC.

3.  NOTIFY[([list])]:  The processor notifies each image in the list that
the invoking image has encountered a notify statement.  If the list is not
present, the processor notifies all images.

4.  QUERY[([list][,ready])]:  If the second argument is not present, the
processor suspends execution until the invoking image has been notified by
each image in the list at least as many times as it has invoked the query
statement for that image.  The processor increases the count by one before  
resuming execution.

If the second argument is present, the processor determines whether the invoking
image has been notified by each image in the list at least as many times as it
has invoked the query statement for that image.  If that condition is satisfied,
the processor increases the count by one and sets ready = .true. before
resuming execution.  If that condition is not satisfied,
the processor does not increase the count and sets ready = .false. before
resuming execution.

If the first argument is not present, the processor queries all images.

The logical variable ready shall not be a co-array.

5.  ALLOCATE: The processor allocates memory and then suspends execution
on the invoking image until all images have encountered the same ALLOCATE
statement and have allocated memory.  Size, shape and order of co-arrays
involved in the allocate shall be the same on all images.

6.  DEALLOCATE: The processor suspends execution on the invoking image until all
images have encountered the same DEALLOCATE  statement and then deallocates
memory.

7.  CRITICAL:  The processor allows one and only one image at a time to pass
the critical statment.

8.  END CRITICAL:  The processor allows a new image to enter the critical
region.

9.  OPEN(unit=u,access=*):  The processor connects unit=u to all images in
DIRECT ACCESS mode and suspends execution on the invoking image until all
images have encountered the same OPEN statement.  All keywords shall be
the same on all images.

10.  CLOSE(u):    The processor suspends execution on the invoking image until
all images have encountered the same CLOSE statement and then
disconnects unit=u from all images.

11.  END (procedure):  Same behavior as DEALLOCATE when there is an implicit
deallocation of a co-array at the end of a procedure.

12. RETURN (procedure):  Same behavior as DEALLOCATE when there is an implicit
deallocation of a co-array at the end of a procedure.

13. STOP:  All images stop execution whenever one image executes a STOP
statement.

14. END PROGRAM:  The processor performs all the activities implied by the
normal rules for Fortran.

B.  Program state

As the program executes, each image is in one and only one segment at a time.
That segment is the current segment for each image.  The current
<<program state>> is the set of current segments on each image.  The current
program state persists until at least one image crosses to
a new segment.  The new program state becomes the current program state.

C.  Memory consistency

For any program state, if one image defines a co-array variable,
no other image shall reference or define the same co-array variable.

A segment W:X in Program State I and segment Y:Z in Program State J>=I are paired if
execution of statement X on Image P changes Program State from I to I+1
and allows execution of statement Z on Image Q to change Program State from J to J+1.
Image Q, in Program State J+1, may reference a co-array variable defined by Image P,
in Program State I<J+1, if and only if no image defines the variable for any possible
Program State K with I<=K<=J.

The programmer is responsible for avoiding memory race conditions for any possible
sequence of program states as the program executes.

D.  Example

Consider the following program:

Program NonConforming 
    real :: a[*]
    integer :: Iam
        :
     Iam = this_image
     a = 0
     sync
     if (Iam==1)then
         notify(2)  ! This statement should be after the next
         a = 1
     else if (Iam==2)then
         query(1)
         a[1] = a[1] + 1
     end if
     sync
     if (Iam==1) write(*,*) a
     sync
end Program NonConforming 

To see why this program is non-conforming, let

P = PROGRAM
S = SYNC
N = NOTIFY
Q = QUERY
E = END PROGRAM
     
and let X:Y mean the segment between segment boundary statements X and Y.
     
Then as the program executes we have
     
     Program State      |   Image 1  |  Image 2
----------------------- | ---------- | --------
          0             |    P:S a=0 |   P:S a=0
          1             |    S:N     |   S:Q
          2             |    N:S a=1 |   Q:S  a[1]=a[1]+1
          3             |S:S write a |   S:S
          4             |    S:E     |   S:E

The notation

          0             |    P:S a=0 |   P:S a=0

means that both Image 1 and Image 2 define the variable a=0 in program
state 0 while they are both in their own segment P:S.  The notation

          2             |    N:S a=1 |   Q:S  a[1]=a[1]+1

means that in program state 2, Image 1 defines a=1 while in its segment N:S
and Image 2 both references and defines a[1]=a[1]+1 while in its segment Q:S.
The program is non-conforming in Program State 2 because we cannot predict,
from run to run, what order the statements in that program state will execute
on each iamge.

On the other hand, the program conforms if we move the notify statement
one line down:

Program Conforming 
    real :: a[*]
    integer :: Iam
        :
     Iam = this_image
     a = 0
     sync
     if (Iam==1)then
         a = 1
         notify(2)  ! This statement is now in the right place
     else if (Iam==2)then
         query(1)
         a[1] = a[1] + 1
     end if
     sync
     if (Iam==1) write(*,*) a
     sync
end Program Conforming 

     Program State      |   Image 1  |  Image 2
----------------------- | ---------- | --------
          0             |    P:S a=0 |   P:S a=0
          1             |    S:N a=1 |   S:Q
          2             |    N:S     |   Q:S a[1]=a[1]+1
          3             |S:S write a |   S:S
          4             |    S:E     |   S:E

The notation

          1             |    S:N a=1 |   S:Q

means that Image 1 defines a=1 while the program is in program state 1
with Image 1 in its segment S:N and Image 2 in its segment S:Q.  When
Image 1 executes its NOTIFY, both images move to their next segment:  Image 1
goes to its segment N:S and Image 2 goes to its segment Q:S.  Now it is
safe for Image 2 to reference and define a[1].  The notation

          2             |    N:S     |   Q:S  a[1]=a[1]+1

means that Image 2 executes a[1]=a[1]+1 while the program is in
program state 2 and Image 2 is in its segment Q:S while Image 1 is in its
segment N:S.

Segment S:N for Image 1 in Program State 1 is paired with segment S:Q for Image 2
in the same Program State 1.  Image 1, and only Image 1, defines variable a=1 in State 1.
Execution of the NOTIFY statement by Image 1 at the end of its segment S:N allows
Image 2 to resume execution beyond the QUERY statement at the end of its paired segment S:Q.
The program state changes from State 1 to State 2.  Since no other image defines the
variable in either State 1 or State 2, Image 2 may reference the value defined by
Image 1 and may define a new value in the memory of Image 1.
  

If for some reason Image 2 does not immediately resume execution past its QUERY statement,
for example, it has been interrupted, Image 1 may carry on to other segments of its own
that change the program state.  For example, it may notify other images:
 
     Program State      |   Image 1  |  Image 2
----------------------- | ---------- | --------
          0             |    P:S a=0 |   P:S a=0
          1             |    S:N a=1 |   S:Q
          2             |    N:N     |   S:Q
          3             |    N:N     |   S:Q
          4             |    N:N     |   S:Q
          5             |    N:S     |   Q:S a[1]=a[1]+1
          6             |S:S write a |   S:S
          7             |    S:E     |   S:E

No image may define the co-array variable a[1] on Image 1 for any of the Prgoram
States 2,3, or 4.


9.  Remove constraint C541 (R510 and 510a) in J3/06-122: The sum of the rank 
and co-rank shall not exceed fifteen.

This constraint violates one of the basic principles of the co-array model:  
the rules for co-dimensions are the same rules as for normal dimensions unless 
there is a compelling reason to make them different.  For example, the rule 
that omitting the co-dimension defaults to the local variable is different 
from the rule that omitting a normal dimension defaults to the entire array.  
The compelling reason for this difference is that the overwhelming use of 
co-array variables in a program will be for local variables.  The programmer 
should not be forced to write a[this_image] for every local variable or, 
worse yet, to write a[me], which forces the compiler to perform analysis to
figure out if the reference is local or to give up performance by assuming 
that it might be remote. 

There is no compelling reason to restrict the number of co-dimensions to less 
than 15 just as the normal dimensions are not restricted to less than 15.  
It adds a new rule to the language with no benefit.
