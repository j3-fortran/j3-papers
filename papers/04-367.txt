NUMBER:
TITLE: Error in Example in Note 8.10
KEYWORDS: ASSOCIATE Construct
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Constraint C614 states, “There shall not be more than one part-ref
with nonzero rank” in a structure component.  A structure component
is a designator (R603),  which is a variable (R601).  The selector
in an ASSOCIATE construct is either a variable or an expression (R819).
The third example in Note 8.10 supposedly illustrates association
with an array section (one form of a variable).  However, the associate
name ARRAY is associated with a selector that has two parts of nonzero
rank.  Is this an error?

ANSWER:

Yes.

DISCUSSION:

It was not intended that an illegal form be allowed for a selector,
even if the illegality is seemingly removed when the associate name
appears in the block.  This would imply that the construct functioned
like a macro processor, which it does not.

EDITS:

Replace the block in the third example of Note 8.10 with:

                 ARRAY % EV = ARRAY % EV * 2.0
