Detailed Specification:

The C_SIZEOF function, defined in the ISO_C_BINDING intrinsic module,
will return the size of its argument, as defined by the C sizeof
operator.  If the argument is an array, the intent is that C_SIZEOF
should return the size of the array, not the size of an equivalent C
pointer.


Syntax:

No new syntax.


Edits:

[125:41+] Add list item "(4++) the intrinsic module function C_SIZEOF,"

[395:31+++] (after Note 15.6) Add section

15.1.2.6 C_SIZEOF (X)

  Description.   Returns the size of X in bytes, as defined by the C
                 sizeof operator (Section 6.5.3.4 of the C
                 International Standard).

  Class.         Inquiry function.

  Arguments.
     X           shall be an interoperable data entity that is not an
                 assumed-size array.

  Result Characteristics.
                 Scalar integer of kind C_SIZE_T (15.2.1).

  Result Value.  If X is scalar, the result value is the value that
                 the C processor returns as the result of applying the
                 sizeof operator (Section 6.5.3.4 of the C
                 International Standard) to an object of a type that
                 interoperates with the type of X.

                 If X is an array, the result value is the value that
                 the C processor returns as the result of applying the
                 sizeof operator to an object of a type that
                 interoperates with the type of X, multiplied by the
                 number of elements in X.
