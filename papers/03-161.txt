From: Kurt W. Hirchert                  (Meeting 164) 14 Mar 2003

Item TC11 from the UK ballot proposes to add the functionality to
reallocate allocatable objects.  As it happens, I have given
considerable thought to this particular subject.  For what it's
worth, here is a condensed presentation of that thought:

===========
The Problem
===========

The basic problem is to change the allocation of an allocatable
object while retaining some part of its existing value.

When we start considering the practicalities of doing this, we
can divide the possible reallocations into two classes which I
will label simple reallocations and general reallocations.

Simple reallocations are those where the retained values stay at
the same positions relative to each other and the beginning of the
object.  The classic example of this is also the single most common
kind of reallocation -- adding (or removing) elements at the end
of a one-dimensional array.  Other simple problems include
*  changing the upper bound of the outer dimension of a multi-
   dimensional array,
*  changing a type parameter of a scalar object that affects only
   the upper bound of that last component in the object, and
*  changing the type (but not the type parameters) of a scalar
   polymorphic object (thus adding or removing components at the
   end of the object),
but these problems occur much less frequently than the classic
problem.

General reallocations, then, are those where positions of the
retained values shift.  These include
*  adding (or removing) elements at beginning of an array,
*  adding (or removing) elements in the middle of an array (e.g.,
   to change the resolution of a solution grid),
*  altering a dimension of a multi-dimensional array other than
   the outer dimension, and
*  changing the type or type parameters of an array.
Although individually less common than the classic simple
reallocation, collectively these problems represent a significant
part of the problem space, especially if one moves away from "toy"
problems to "serious" ones.

Your experience may be different, but in my estimation, if you
provide a facility that only adequately addresses simple
reallocations, you have, at best, address only half the problem.

===============
Implementations
===============

o  Conventional reallocation of allocatable objects (two copy
   reallocation):
   1.  Allocate a temporary object large enough to hold the values
       to be retained.
   2.  Copy the values to be retained to the temporary object.
   3.  Deallocate the original object.
   4.  Allocate the original object in its new size.
   5.  Copy the retained values to their proper locations in the
       new allocation.
   6.  Deallocate the temporary.
   The significant costs of this method are the two copies of
   the retained values and the likely fragmentation of both the
   old allocation and the temporary allocation (2c+2f).

o  Conventional reallocation of objects located through pointers
   (one copy reallocation):
   1.  Allocate the new allocation through a temporary pointer.
   2.  Copy the values to be retained from the original object to
       the new allocation.
   3.  Deallocate the original object.
   4.  Transfer the allocation from the temporary pointer to the
       pointer being reallocated.
   The significant costs of this method are the single copy of
   the retained values and the likely fragmentation of the old
   allocation (1c+1f).  In other words, it costs about half the
   previous method.  The reason it cannot be applied to allocatable
   objects in Fortran 9x is that we have nothing analogous to
   pointer assignment for performing step (4).

o  In-place reallocation:
   1.  If the space needed for the new allocation can be satisfied
       by the existing allocation and available memory following
       it, just "append" the necessary memory to the existing
       allocation, rearrange the retained values if necessary,
       and return.
   For simple reallocations, this method costs 0c+0f and is
   sometimes seen as a kind of "holy grail" of reallocation.  For
   general reallocations, the cost is 1c+0f.  (Although writing
   code to rearrange the retained values in place is often a major
   pain, its CPU cost should be roughly equivalent to that of a
   copy.) In practice, however, this kind of reallocation is not
   always possible, so an actual implementation would have to try
   this and do something else (probably one copy reallocation) if
   this is not possible.  If the success rate of the in-place part
   is 10%, the effective cost for simple reallocations is .9c+.9f.
   If the success rate is only 1%, the effect cost for simple
   reallocations is .99c+.99f.

o  VM in-place reallocation:
   In comp.lang.fortran, James Giles has suggested a variation on
   on in-place reallocation:  Instead of using one copy
   reallocation as the backup for ordinary in-place reallocation,
   the backup is to change the virtual memory page map to put
   the object somewhere an in-place reallocation _is_ possible.
   Since this remapping fragments the address space like one copy
   but does not impose the copy cost, the effective cost of simple
   reallocation, given a 10% success rate on the initial attempt,
   would be 0c+.9f.  In practice, it is not cost effective to
   allocate everything in whole pages, so there are additional
   complications related to deciding which things to allocate in
   pages and which in smaller units, and there has to be a backup
   method for reallocating objects that were initially allocated
   in the smaller units, but such complications will tend to have
   only a small effect on the effective cost of reallocation
   because objects that are reallocated tend to be bigger and thus
   will tend to have been allocated in pages in the first place.

My thoughts about the implementations:
*  For general reallocations, the in-place methods are a pain to
   write (because of the difficulty of rearranging the retained
   values in place), offer _no_ reduction in copy costs, and offer
   only a small saving in fragmentation costs, so I would stick to
   one copy reallocation for general reallocations.
*  My estimation of the initial success rate for in-place
   reallocation is that it will be quite low, so even for simple
   reallocation, I do not see enough benefit from ordinary in-place
   reallocation to make it worth attempting.
*  The VM variant of in-place reallocation looks interesting for
   simple reallocations, provided one is prepared to deal with the
   complications it adds to the overall memory management system.

=================
Language Features
=================

Proposals for reallocation facilities often are "single-statement"
solutions; that is, they often provide for a complete reallocation
to be expressed as a single statement.  In the past, they have
typically been for a REALLOCATE statement or some kind of option
to reallocate using the ALLOCATE statement.  In the current UK
ballot, the proposal is for an intrinsic procedure to perform the
reallocation.  The contentious design issue in such proposals has
been the question of where the retained values end up.  One common
choice, reflected in the UK proposal, is for the values to remain
at the same relative positions.
*  By definition, such a facility does simple reallocations and
   gives the implementor the possibility of doing them using
   whatever method would be optimal in the environment.  Even if
   this method is no more efficient than what the user could write
   explicitly, its packaging as a single statement makes it
   attractive for simple reallocations.
*  On the other hand, one should not delude oneself into believing
   that this has _any_ value in address the problem of general
   reallocations:
   +  The necessity of the user doing additional value copying
      after the single-statement reallocation wipes out any
      efficiency advantage that might have resulted if, for
      example, the implementation were able to do an in-place
      reallocation, and the odds are that the cummulative cost
      will be higher.
   +  Moving values to where they belong is a nuisance for
      one-dimensional arrays.  For multi-dimensional arrays, it
      becomes a seriously difficult problem.  Compact, convenient
      notations, such as the suggestion in the UK ballot to use
      RESHAPE, are also likely to be even more inefficient
      because of the likelihood that the processor will
      evaluate the RHS to a temporary and then copy it back to the
      original array.
   +  The UK proposal does not address reallocation that changes
      type or type parameters, although I believe this is something
      people will want to do.  However, if one tries to extend this
      approach to such problems, moving the values to the right
      place becomes nearly impossible, because component values
      may be left is locations that are now interpreted to have
      a different type or attributes.  (This can cause other
      semantic problems, including interesting issues about
      finalization and default initialization in such
      reallocations.)

A second alternative is that values are retained in the position
that has the same subscript or substring values.
*  In theory, this means that there are simple reallocations that
   the facility no longer performs, but simple reallocations where
   it is desired that subscript or substring values change are
   rare.
*  This does allow the processor to do many general reallocations as
   part of the single statement.  It also avoids putting values in
   locations with the wrong component type when changing the type
   or type parameters of the object.  However, in those general
   reallocations where this is still the wrong place for the
   retained values, it is potentially even less efficient.

In theory, a third alternative would be to offer an option for the
single statement to specify explicitly where the retained values
are to end up.  There are various minor problems associated with
this approach, but the major problem thus far has been that no one
has yet proposed a satisfactory syntax for the specification.

An alternative to the single-statement approach is to provide tools
that allow the user to program reallocation methods explicitly.
Such solutions are likely to be more verbose, but they give the
user more control.

The obvious tool to provide is some kind of analog to pointer
assignment for allocatables, so the user can explicitly code a
one-copy reallocation.

Other tool possibilities are less obvious, but they include a
conditional in-place extension of an allocatable object, the
ability to associate more space with an allocatable object than
it immediately requires, and the ability to remap the space
belonging to an allocatable object.

===========
Conclusions
===========

The following are _my_ conclusions from the above analysis:

o  The single most valuable thing we could do is to provide the
   pointer assignment analog.  This improves the situation for
   all allocations by making possible one-copy reallocations
   in place of the two-copy allocations that must be performed
   now.
   *  This is "small" enough, technically and editorially to do
      in the time frame availabe.
   *  Because such a feature has many uses beyond reallocation,
      adopting it should be neither a political nor a technical
      impediment to adopting other reallocation features, now
      or in a future revision.
   For this reason, I am separately submitting a paper (J3/03-162)
   with edits to add a MOVE_ALLOC intrinsic subroutine and/or a
   SWAP_ALLOC intrinsic.  My personal preference would be for
   MOVE_ALLOC, but I have prepared both in case others think
   SWAP_ALLOC would be more useful.

o  Given that we have XXXX_ALLOC to cover general case, I might
   then consider a single-statement solution to provide more
   convenient packaging for as many cases as we can cover.
   *  My leaning would be towards adding a keyword to ALLOCATE
      rather than adding an intrinsic procedure, because it
      offers a more natural notation for expressing the
      attributes one might wish to change.
   *  I would lean towards the same subscripts solution rather
      than the same position solution, because I think it would
      make the single statement applicable a greater percentage
      of the time and because it seems to be better behaved
      semantically in the general cases.  (As a compromise, I
      could accept limiting the facility to those cases where
      the same subscript and same position models yield the
      same result.)
   *  I am nervous, however, about whether we do an adequate
      job on any form of the single-statement solution in one
      meeting.

o  Even if we do both of the above, it might be worth looking at
   providing additional tools in the next revision.
