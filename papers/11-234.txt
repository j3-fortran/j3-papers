Subject: UK Comments GB30-GB32 TS 29113
From: Bill Long
Date: 2011 October 03
References: WG5/N1869, WG5/N1880, WG5/N1881

Discussion:

The initial comments GB30, 31, and 32 in the UK Ballot were:

GB30: Replace "of the appropriate rank" by "with the same rank as
{source}". {"appropriate rank" is too vague. The rank must be that of
{source}.}

GB31: Before "If" add "The {type} member specifies the type of the
array section." {It would be much better to give the purpose of {type}
here rather than at the end of the paragraph after the elem_len
paragraph.}

GB32: Delete "The corresponding ... result.". {The proposed change for
"result" makes the sentence "The corresponding ... result."
redundant.}

Regarding GB30, the new edit might be read as implying that {source}
has a rank, but source is just a pointer to a C descriptor.  The
descriptor is what has the rank member.

Regarding GB31, the edit itself is fine. However, the last sentence of
the paragraph following the formal parameter descriptions, "In the C
descriptor pointed to by {result}, the {type} member shall be the
specifier for the type of the part.", is now redundant and should be
deleted.

GB32 is fine as is, and included here to keep these three together.


Edits to N1869:

5.3.5.8, in the description of the result parameter for

\cf{source}".  {GB30, modified edit.}

5.3.5.8, in the description of the result parameter for
CFI_select_part - before "If" insert "The \cf{type} member specifies
the type of the array section.". {GB31.}

5.3.5.8, in the description of the source parameter for
CFI_select_part, delete the last sentence "The corresponding values
... source and result.". {GB32.}

parameter for CFI_select_part - delete the last sentence "In the C
