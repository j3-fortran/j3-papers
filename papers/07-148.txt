Subject: UTIs 73 & 90: components of IMAGE_TEAM

Discussion

The editor would like us to say that IMAGE_TEAM has pointer
components, which will automatically restrict the way it can be
used. There is no obligation on the implemetation to do this since the
components are private so there is no way for a program to access
them.

Edits are provided to implement this.

Note that the edit at [120:4-5] partially addresses UTI 89. A separate
paper addresses the remainder of that UTI.

Edits to J3/07-007

[63:25-26]. In 4.5.4.1 Component definition statement, C446, change
"of type IMAGE_TEAM (13.8.2.7), C_PTR, or C_FUNPTR" to
"of type C_PTR or C_FUNPTR".

[91:6]. In 5.3.7.1 General, C526, change
"of type IMAGE_TEAM (13.8.2.7), C_PTR, or C_FUNPTR" to
"of type C_PTR or C_FUNPTR".

[119:9]. In 6.1.2 Structure components, C617, change
"of type IMAGE_TEAM (13.8.2.7), C_PTR, or C_FUNPTR" to
"of type C_PTR or C_FUNPTR".

[120:4-5]. In 6.1.2 Structure components, final paragraph, change
"of type IMAGE_TEAM (13.8.2.7), C_PTR, or C_FUNPTR" to
"of type C_PTR or C_FUNPTR".

[437:5] In 13.8.2.7 "IMAGE_TEAM", line 2, change "has no co-array
components" to "has pointer components but no allocatable components".

[437:6+] In 13.8.2.7 "IMAGE_TEAM", NOTE 13.26, replace the last
sentence with: "This information is likely to vary between
images. Because the standard treats the information as held in pointer
components, copying a value of this type to another image causes its
value on that image to become undefined."
