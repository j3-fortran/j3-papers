Introduction

At meeting 218, paper 19-160 was passed supporting specifications
of the Part 2 procedures in the main standard.  The edits in this paper
propose to add a new 16.10.3 following the 16.10.2 subclause describing
the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module.



Syntax

The results of straw votes taken at 218 regarding the names of the
module and its contained procedures are assumed; these may be changed
by new straw votes.  However, this paper does not propose
new straw votes.  The reasons given for these decisions are
existing usage, and clarity of the part 2 names.

This paper attempts to craft edits.

"
16.10.3 The ISO_FORTRAN_STRINGS intrinsic module

16.10.3.1 General
The intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_STRINGS provides public entities
for character manipulation.

The processor shall provide the named procedures described in 16.10.3.
In the detailed descriptions below, procedure names are generic
and not specific.  They may have character arguments
of any character kind supported by the processor.


16.10.3.2 EXTRACT ( STRING [, START, FINISH] )

<<Description.>> Extracts a substring.

<<Class.>> Elemental function.

<<Arguments.>>
STRING            shall be of type CHARACTER.  The corresponding
                  actual argument shall not be an unallocated
                  allocatable, an unassociated pointer,
                  or an optional dummy argument.
START (optional)  shall be of type INTEGER.
FINISH (optional) shall be of type INTEGER.

<<Result Characteristics.>> Of type CHARACTER and
of the same kind as STRING.

<<Result Value.>> The result value is a copy of the characters
of the argument STRING between positions START and FINISH, inclusive.
If START is absent or its value is less than one,
the result value is the same
as if it were present with the value one.
If FINISH is absent or its value is greater than LEN(STRING),
the result value
is the same as if it were present with the value LEN(STRING).
If FINISH is less than START, the result value is a zero-length string.



16.10.3.3 INSERT (STRING, START, SUBSTRING)

<<Description.>> Inserts a substring.

<<Class.>> Elemental function.

<<Arguments.>>
STRING    shall be type CHARACTER.  The corresponding
          actual argument shall not be an unallocated allocatable,
          an unassociated pointer, or an optional dummy argument.
START     shall be type INTEGER.  The corresponding
          actual argument shall not be an unallocated allocatable,
          an unassociated pointer, or an optional dummy argument.
SUBSTRING shall be type CHARACTER of the same kind as STRING.
          The corresponding
          actual argument shall not be an unallocated allocatable,
          an unassociated pointer, or an optional dummy argument.

<<Result Characteristics.>> Type CHARACTER.

<<Result Value.>> The result value is a copy of the characters
of the argument STRING with the characters of SUBSTRING inserted
into the copy of STRING before the character at the character position
START. If the value of START is greater than LEN(STRING),
the result value is
the same as if it were LEN(STRING)
and SUBSTRING is appended to the copy of STRING.
If the value of START is less than one, the result value is the same
as if it were the value one and SUBSTRING is inserted
before the first character of the copy of STRING.



16.10.3.4 REMOVE (STRING [, START, FINISH])

<<Description.>> Removes a specified substring.

<<Class.>> Elemental function.

<<Arguments.>>
STRING            shall be of type CHARACTER.  The corresponding
                  actual argument shall not be an unallocated
                  allocatable, an unassociated pointer, or an optional
                  dummy argument.
START (optional)  shall be of type INTEGER.
FINISH (optional) shall be of type INTEGER.

<<Result Characteristics.>> Of type CHARACTER of the same kind
                            as STRING.

<<Result Value.>> The result value is a copy of the characters
of STRING with the characters between positions START and FINISH,
inclusive, removed. If START is absent or less than one, the result
value is the same as if it were present with the value one.
If FINISH is absent or its value is greater than LEN(STRING),
the result value is the same
as if it were present with the value LEN(STRING).
If the value of FINISH is less than the value of START,
the result value is the characters
of STRING delivered unchanged as the result.



16.10.3.5 REPLACE (STRING, START, SUBSTRING) or
REPLACE (STRING, START, FINISH, SUBSTRING) or
REPLACE (STRING, TARGET, SUBSTRING [,EVERY, BACK])

<<Description.>> Replaces a subset of a string.

<<Class.>> Elemental function.

<<Arguments.>>
STRING        shall be of type CHARACTER.  The corresponding
              actual argument shall not be an unallocated allocatable,
              an unassociated pointer, nor an optional dummy argument.
START         shall be of type INTEGER.  The corresponding
              actual argument shall not be an unallocated allocatable,
              an unassociated pointer, nor an optional dummy argument.
FINISH        shall be of type INTEGER.  The corresponding
              actual argument shall not be an unallocated allocatable,
              an unassociated pointer, nor an optional dummy argument.
SUBSTRING     shall be of type CHARACTER of the same kind as STRING.
              The corresponding
              actual argument shall not be an unallocated allocatable,
              an unassociated pointer, nor an optional dummy argument.
TARGET        shall be of type CHARACTER of the same kind as STRING.
              It shall not be of zero length.  The corresponding
              actual argument shall not be an unallocated allocatable,
              an unassociated pointer, nor an optional dummy argument.
EVERY (optional) shall be of type LOGICAL.
BACK (optional) shall be of type LOGICAL.

<<Result Characteristics.>> Of type CHARACTER of the same kind as STRING.

<<Result Value.>> The result value is a copy of the characters
in STRING modified as per one of the cases below.

Case(i): For a reference of the form
    REPLACE(STRING, START, SUBSTRING)
the characters of the argument SUBSTRING are inserted into the copy
of STRING beginning with the character at the character position START.
The characters in positions from START
to MIN(STRING+LEN(SUBSTRING)-1,LEN(STRING)) are deleted. If the value
of START is greater than LEN(STRING), the result value is as if it
were the value LEN(STRING)+1 and SUBSTRING is appended to the copy
of STRING.  If the value of START is less than one,
the result value is as if it were the value one.

Case(ii): For a reference of the form
    REPLACE(STRING, START, FINISH, SUBSTRING)
the characters in the copy of STRING between positions START and FINISH,
including those at START and FINISH, are deleted and replaced
by the characters of SUBSTRING. If the value of START is less than one,
the result value is as if it were the value one.
If the value of FINISH is greater than LEN(STRING), the result value
is as if it were LEN(STRING). If FINISH is less than START,
the characters of SUBSTRING are inserted before the character at START
and no characters are deleted.

Case(iii): For a reference of the form
    REPLACE(STRING, TARGET, SUBSTRING, EVERY, BACK)
the copy of STRING is searched for occurrences of TARGET. The search
is done in the backward direction if the argument BACK is present
with the value true, and in the forward direction otherwise. If TARGET
is found, it is replaced by SUBSTRING. If EVERY is present
with the value true, the search and replace is continued
from the character following TARGET in the search direction specified
until all occurrences of TARGET in the copy STRING are replaced;
otherwise only the first occurrence of TARGET is replaced.



16.10.3.6 SPLIT (STRING, WORD, SET [, SEPARATOR, BACK])

<<Description.>> Splits a string into two substrings.

<<Class.>> Elemental subroutine.

<<Arguments.>>
STRING   shall be of type CHARACTER. It is an INTENT(INOUT) argument.
         The corresponding actual argument shall not be
         an unallocated allocatable, an unassociated pointer,
         or an optional dummy argument.
WORD     shall be of type CHARACTER of the same kind as STRING.
         It is an INTENT(OUT) argument.  The corresponding
         actual argument shall not be an unallocated allocatable,
         an unassociated pointer, nor an optional dummy argument.
SET      shall be of type CHARACTER of the same kind as STRING.
         It is an INTENT(IN) argument.
         The corresponding actual argument shall not be
         an unallocated allocatable, an unassociated pointer,
         or an optional dummy argument.
SEPARATOR (optional) shall be of type CHARACTER of the same kind
         as STRING. It is an INTENT(OUT) argument.
BACK (optional) shall be of type LOGICAL.
         It is an INTENT(IN) argument.

<<Action.>> The effect of the procedure is to divide STRING
at the first occurrence of a character that is in SET. The STRING is
searched in the forward direction unless BACK is present with the value
true, in which case the search is in the backward direction.
The characters passed over in the search are returned
in the argument WORD as if by intrinsic assignment
and the remainder of STRING, not including
the SEPARATOR character, is returned in the argument STRING
as if by intrinsic assignment. If
the argument SEPARATOR is present, the actual character found which
separates WORD from the remainder of STRING is returned
in SEPARATOR as if by intrinsic assignment.
If no character from SET is found or SET is of zero length,
the whole STRING is returned in WORD as if by intrinsic assignment,
STRING is returned as zero length,
and SEPARATOR (if present) is returned as zero length.

The effect of the procedure is such that, on return,
either WORD//SEPARATOR//STRING
is the same as the initial STRING for a forward search,
or STRING//SEPARATOR//WORD is the same as the initial STRING
for a backward search.
