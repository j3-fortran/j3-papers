NOTE 8.31 states
   Apart from the effects of volatile variables, the processor may
   optimize the execution of a segment as if it were the only image in
   execution.
Unfortunately, this is not quite correct. It must not perform an
optimization that might break the rule about definitions and references
in unordered segments. For example, consider the code
     integer (kind=short) x(8)[*]
        :
     !  Computation that references and alters x(1:7)
        :
The compiler must not effectively make this replacement
     integer (kind=short) x(8)[*], temp(8)
        :
     temp(1:8) = x(1:8) ! Faster than temp(1:7) = x(1:7)
     !  Computation that references and alters temp(1:7)
     x(1:8) = temp(1:8)
because another image might reference x(8) in a segment that is
unordered with respect to this one.

NOTE 8.32 needs to be revised to take account of executions of atomic 
subroutines.

Edits are provided to correct these notes.


Edits to 09-007r1

[190:23+] In 8.5.2, Segments, replace the body of NOTE 8.31 by

   Because of the restrictions on references and definitions in
   unordered segments, the processor may apply code motion optimizations
   within a segment as if it were the only image in execution,
   provided calls of atomic subroutines are not involved."
   
[190:23+] In 8.5.2, Segments, NOTE 8.32.
    Start a new para after the first sentence and change "In practice," to    
    "In practice, apart from executions of atomic subroutines,".
    In the final sentence, change "would" to "might".
    At the end of the note, add new para:
    "An execution of an atomic subroutine references the permanent
    memory location of its ATOM argument directly."
