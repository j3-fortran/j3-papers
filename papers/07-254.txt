Discussion

The editor points out that a correction is needed for the text in
C.11.2 that describes informally what collective subroutines do. Also,
we feel that the paragraph should be more informative.

Edit to 07-007r2:

[585:26-27] In C.11.2 Collective co-array subroutine variations,
replace the first paragraph by

    "For a scalar co-array, the intrinsic collective subroutines apply
     an operation to the values of all the corresponding co-arrays on
     a set of images and provide the result on all the images of the
     set in a scalar argument of intent(out). For an array co-array,
     the operation is applied to each set of corresponding elements
     and the result is provided on all the images in an array of the
     shape of the co-array."
