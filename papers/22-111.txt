Discussion
----------

I think I have found two glitches associated with boz constants. 

In 7.7 Binary, octal, and hexadecimal literal constants, C1539 states 
"C7119 (R772) A <boz-literal-constant> shall appear only as a 
<data-stmt-constant> in a DATA statement, as the <initialization> for a 
named constant or variable of type integer or real, as the <expr> in an 
intrinsic assignment whose <variable> is of type integer or real, as an 
<ac-value> in an array constructor with a <type-spec> that specifies type 
integer or real, as an output-item in an output statement, or where 
explicitly allowed in 16.9 as an actual argument of an intrinsic 
procedure."

A boz constant is not allowed as an output-item in an output statement,
see 12.6.3 Data transfer input/output list, para 11, which states
"An output list shall not contain an effective item that is a 
<boz-literal-constant>." This was added by 21-101r1. 

A boz constant is allowed as a <scalar-expr> in an enum constructor, see
C7113 in 7.6.1 Interoperable enumerations and enum types, which states
"The <scalar-expr> in an <enum-constructor> shall be of type integer or 
be a boz-literal-constant.

An edit to C7119 is suggested to cover these problems. 


Edit to 22-007
---------------

[93:35] In 7.7 Binary, octal, and hexadecimal literal constants, C7119,
replace 
"as an output-item in an output statement" by
"as <scalar-expr> in an enum constructor" so 
that the constraint reads

C7119 (R772) A <boz-literal-constant> shall appear only as a 
      <data-stmt-constant> in a DATA statement, as the <initialization> 
      for a named constant or variable of type integer or real, as the 
      <expr> in an intrinsic assignment whose variable is of type 
      integer or real, as an <ac-value> in an array constructor with a 
      <type-spec> that specifies type integer or real, as <scalar-expr> 
      in an enum constructor, or where explicitly allowed in 16.9 as an 
      actual argument of an intrinsic procedure."
