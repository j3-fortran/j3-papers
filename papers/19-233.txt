1. Introduction

This paper proposes fixes to two minor editorial glitches.
I think the first one is uncontroversial, but if there is not
universal agreement, it will need to be an interp.


2. The problems.

One. ATOMIC_CAS has different argument names in Table 16.1 than what it has
     in its description. I believe the description is correct.

Two. There is an extraneous closing parenthesis in a line of example code.


3. Edits to 18-007r1

[444:23] 17.11.7 IEEE_GET_MODES, p4 Example,
    Delete a closing parenthesis, leaving the line as:
        "CALL IEEE_SET_ROUNDING_MODE (IEEE_TO_ZERO)".

[333] Table 16.1, ATOMIC_CAS entry,
      Change "VALUE" to "NEW".
{The argument names in the description are:
    "ATOM, OLD, COMPARE, NEW, STAT".}
