Subject: Proposed ASSERT in Type Definitions


Placing assertions into programs serves at least three purposes:
First, they provide a simple means of debugging; Second, they
document the programmer's intentions; Third, they provide a means
to allow the compiler gain information which might require
entire application analysis, if it could be gleened at all.

If assertions are accepted, they should be allowed to appear
in derived type definitions, where they may specify a property
assumed to be held for objects of that type.

Title: ASSERT in Type Definitions

Submitted By: J3

Status: For Consideration

References: 

Basic Functionality: Make an extension of the executable ASSERT statement
                     to derived type definitions, where they can detect
                     inappropriate values.

Rationale:  Extending assertions to derived type definitions can be used
            to monitor values assigned to variables.  For example, a rank-2
            two by two array may represent a rotation in a plane.  Ensuring
            that the values stored in a variable are unitary assists
            the program developer.  In conjunction with parameterized derived
            types, assertions can be enabled or disabled on a variable
            by variable basis.

Estimated Impact: A new declaration must be supported in derived type
                  definitions.

Detailed Specification: The assertion will declare some property of instances
                        of a derived type, so call it INVARIANT.  An INVARIANT
                        might be implemented as a premise or property
                        of the assignment routine, or of default assignment.

                        INVARIANT( <assert-list> )

                        This declaration applies to objects of the type
                        when the assert level is set to do so.

                        An <assert-list-item> is as defined
                        for the ASSERT statement.

                        Example:

                        type :: rotation_t
                           real, dimension( 2, 2) :: element
                        contains
                           procedure, pass :: norm => norm_2by2
                           invariant( abs( rotation_t% norm() - 1.0) < tol, &
                                        level= assert_warn)
                        end type rotation_t

                        Here, the type name refers to an instance of the type.

                        Example using PDT:

                        type :: rotation_t( alevel)
                           integer, kind :: alevel
                           real, dimension( 2, 2) :: element
                        contains
                           invariant( abs( norm( rotation_t) - 1.0) < tol, &
                                        level= alevel)
                        end type rotation_t

                        type( rotation_t( assert_ignore)) :: party_member

                        type( rotation_t( assert_halt)) :: usual_suspect

                        Assignments to party_member are not checked,
                        assignments to usual_suspect are.

                        Again, the type name refers to an instance of the type,
                        in this case, it is the variable to which assignment
                        is being made.
