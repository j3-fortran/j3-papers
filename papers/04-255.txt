Title:                Piecewise Construction of Named Constant Arrays

Submitted By:    Craig Dedo

Status:            For Consideration

Basic Functionality:
    Fortran should allow a programmer to construct arrays which are 
named constants (i.e., have the PARAMETER attribute) in several statements.

Rationale:
    The Fortran 95 standard and Fortran 2003 FCD require that arrays 
which are named constants be completely constructed in the same 
statement in which they are declared.  This restriction places a 
stringent limit on the length of such an array.  It also increases 
program complexity and decreases program understandability since such 
declarations sometimes require lengthy declaration statements with many 
continuation lines.

    Large sized arrays of named constants are useful in certain fields 
of research and engineering.

Estimated Impact:
    There should be no interaction with other features.  It should not 
be difficult to implement this feature.

Detailed Specification:
    One possible method would be to remove the restriction that named 
constants need to be initialized in the same statement in which they are 
declared.  Then the application developer could use successive PARAMETER 
statements to initialize successive parts of the array.
