Title: The ADDRESS attribute

Submitted by: J3

Status: For Consideration

References: 

Basic Functionality: I propose that modifications be made to the Fortran standard to
allow passing buffers to C IO/communication routines without
explicitly using C_LOC. For this purpose, a new attribute, spelled
ADDRESS in this proposal, is provided. It would only be
compatible with a dummy argument of type TYPE(C_PTR). The C
address of the actual argument is passed by value by the caller.
The actual argument must be a valid argument for the C_LOC
intrinsic, in particular, have the TARGET attribute.
Here is an example:

INTERFACE
   SUBROUTINE MPI_Send(buffer, count), BIND(C,"MPI_Send")
      TYPE(C_PTR), ADDRESS :: buffer ! New attribute
      INTEGER(C_INT), VALUE :: count
   END SUBROUTINE
END INTERFACE

! Make this legal:
REAL(C_FLOAT), DIMENSION(...), TARGET :: buffer
CALL MPI_SEND(buffer,10) ! No need for C_LOC

The above problem is similar to the one with "pass-by-value".
Implementations used to deal with C interop with the %VAL
intrinsic, so that one had to wrap a %VAL around any argument in
a call that required pass-by-value. The present system in which
the VALUE attribute is present in the interface and there is no
difference at the call site is much better for the user and for code
clarity. I am essentially proposing that a similar solution be
implemented to the common problem of passing the address to an
IO-type routine.

Rationale: Many C libraries dealing with IO/communication, and in particular
MPI, have "typeless" dummy arguments (typically for buffers).
These are typically a void pointer in the C interface. Consider the
following (simplified) C prototype:

void MPI_Send(void * buffer, int count);

and its Fortran equivalent:

INTERFACE
   SUBROUTINE MPI_Send(buffer, count), BIND(C,"MPI_Send")
      TYPE(C_PTR), VALUE :: buffer
          INTEGER(C_INT), VALUE :: count
   END SUBROUTINE
END INTERFACE

The actual argument in C can be a pointer (C array) of any type,
and an implicit conversion into a void pointer happens:

float * buffer;
buffer=malloc(...);
MPI_Send(buffer,10); // Works in C

Fortran has a very different system in which the types of the
dummy and actual must match and no implicit conversion happens
at the call point. Therefore, one cannot call the MPI_Send
procedure with anything but a C pointer as an actual argument:

REAL(C_FLOAT), DIMENSION(:), TARGET :: buffer
CALL MPI_SEND(buffer,10) ! NOT OK in Fortran

but the following is OK:

CALL MPI_SEND(C_LOC(buffer),10)

The rationale for the proposed solution is two fold:
1) It allows for easier interfacing to numerous existing libraries,
including the existing Fortran interface to MPI (which is flawed as
described above), from the user perspective.
2) It will allow one to reuse current codes, which use vendor
extensions or simply non-conforming tricks to call MPI_SEND with
different types. This is friendly to existing practices.

Estimated Impact: This will have no cost for the implementations since many
implementations already have a switch that basically lets one
have type mismatches, and since the above change is really just a
syntactic wrapper for something everyone already knows how to
do: Just pass the memory address.

Incorporating this into the standard is not entirely trivial. The
proposed change will require that special provisions be made in
argument association in the case when the dummy is a C pointer
with the ADDRESS. Essentially what we would say is that it is as
if the user had put a C_LOC in the call:

! This:
CALL MPI_SEND(buffer,10)
! should be the same as:
CALL MPI_SEND(C_LOC(buffer),10)

Whether we relax the requirement that the actual be a TARGET
(since the actual of C_LOC needs to) is a different matter. I would
suggest that TARGET be required. If TARGET were optional,
there are issues to consider here such as contiguity requirements
and the provision for copy in/copy out (think Interp 125), as well as
the risk of allowing pointers to be taken by the C procedure and
abused, even in a legal program. I would like to say that, in some
cases, one wants to make sure no copy in/copy out happens (such
as asynchronous communication calls), and in Fortran using the
TARGET attribute is the *only* way to ensure this (Interp 125).


Detailed Specification: A dummy argument interoperable with a C pointer may have the
ADDRESS attribute. The VALUE attribute is implied by the
ADDRESS attribute, but may be duplicated.

If the dummy argument has the ADDRESS attribute, the actual
argument must be a valid actual argument for C_LOC. The value
of the result of C_LOC applied to the actual argument, i.e., the C
adress of the actual argument, is associated with the dummy.
