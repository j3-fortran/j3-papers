NUMBER: TBD
TITLE: Coarrays and pointer components
KEYWORD: Coarrays, pointers
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION 1:

Is the following program intended to be conforming?

PROGRAM Main
    TYPE :: Mytype
        INTEGER, POINTER :: ptr(:) => NULL()
    END TYPE Mytype
    TYPE(Mytype) :: coarray[*]
    IF (THIS_IMAGE() == 1) THEN
        coarray%ptr = coarray[2]%ptr    ! OK
        coarray = coarray[2]    ! Case 1
        coarray[3] = coarray    ! Case 2
    END IF
END PROGRAM Main


QUESTION 2:

Should a diagnostic be required for the following program?

PROGRAM Main
    TYPE :: Mytype
        INTEGER, POINTER :: ptr(:)
    END TYPE Mytype
    TYPE(Mytype) :: coarray[*]
    ALLOCATE(coarray%ptr(THIS_IMAGE()))
    coarray%ptr = 10*THIS_IMAGE()
    SYNC ALL
    IF (THIS_IMAGE() == 1) THEN
        coarray%ptr = coarray[2]%ptr    ! OK
        coarray = coarray[2]    ! Case 1
        coarray[3] = coarray    ! Case 2
    END IF
END PROGRAM Main


DISCUSSION:

Question 1:

13.7.125p1 says that NULL returns a disassociated pointer.  7.2.2.3p2
states that pointers may not become associated with targets on other
images, but that does not apply here because there is no such target.
It isn't obvious that this should be allowed, as there are reasonable
implementations where a disassociated pointer would be an image-specific
special value.  For example, to distinguish it from a missing optional
argument, or for debugging and validation purposes.

Question 2:

This is clearly not conforming by 7.2.2.3p2, but the question is whether
it was an oversight not to have a constraint that forbids all of the
above.

Coarrays cannot be pointers (C546).  Coindexed objects cannot be pointer
or target objects (C723 and C725), allocated or deallocated (C644),
associated using ASSOCIATE (C803), or an actual argument corresponding
to a dummy pointer (C1242).  Coindexed objects with pointer ultimate
components may not be an actual argument to a procedure (C1237).  All
of these are constraints, and thus require a diagnostic.

There is essentially only one way to use coarrays with pointer
components correctly across images, which is as in the statements marked
'OK'.  All of the most likely user errors are blocked by constraints,
except for direct assignment.

I can see no realistic purpose in allowing the first example and not the
last, and doing so seems tricky, so the simplest solution would be to
block this 'gotcha' entirely by adding a constraint.  It would also be
the best software engineering.  Edits are supplied to do this.


ANSWER:

Neither of the examples are intended to be conforming, and a diagnostic
should be required in all cases.  Edits are provided to correct the
oversight.


EDITS:

[153] At the end of 7.2.1.1 C713, add

    ", or a coindexed-named-object with a pointer ultimate component"

[153] After of 7.2.1.1 C713, add a new constraint

    "C7xx (R732) The expr shall not be a coindexed-named-object with a
     pointer ultimate component."
