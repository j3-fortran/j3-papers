>>  Subgroup recommended actions
1)  Page 107, Note 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3.  These don't add anything to the
text and should be deleted.
>>  Page 107, delete note 7.1, 7.2, and 7.3

2)  Page 113, 7.1.4.1.  First paragraph.  We should add type-param-inquiry 
and type-param-name to the list to be parallel with  R701.
>>  Page 113:9 After "function reference," add " type parameter inquiry, type parameter name,"
Page 113:17+  Insert "If it is a type parameter inquiry or type parameter name, it is a scalar integer with the kind of the type parameter."
 
3)  Page 113, 7.1.4.1, paragraph after bulleted list.  the last sentence
appears to rule out a disassociated pointer as the second argument to
ASSOCIATED, yet associated only requires not undefined.
>>  nothing needed

4)  Page 114, 7.1.6.  Why do we use the term "restricted expression"?
The only use of "restricted" that I found were in 7.1.6 and there we say
a specification expression must be a restricted expression.  Wouldn't
the section read better if we replaced all references to "restricted" by
"specification"?   See the initialization section following this one.
>>  nothing needed

5)  Page 114, 7.1.6, bullet (8)  Is "other standard intrinsic" the right
term.  The "other" is sort of dangling.  I think this is a holdover from
F95 where (7) had a list of inquiry functions.  I think "standard
intrinsic that is not used as a specification inquiry" might work
>>  nothing needed

6)  Page 114, 7.1.6.  (5) and (11) seem somewhat redundant
>>  nothing needed

7)  Page 115, note 7.12, last sentence.  I believe specification
functions can be recursive.  It's that they can't invoke the current
procedure.  Change "recursion" to "self recursion".
>>  nothing needed

8)  Page 115, 2 paragraphs after note 7.12.  Are these going to be changed 
due to an interp about what previous means?  If not, they are unclear.
>>  nothing needed

9)  Page 116, 7.1.7.  I'd copy the first sentence of 7.1.6 here (with
obvious changes) to describe what init-exprs are good for.
>> 117:1+  Insert  "An <<(bold)initialization expression>> is an expression with limitations that make it suitable for use as a kind type parameter, as an initializer, or in a parameter statement."
117:2  Change "An initialization expression" to "It"

10)  Page 116, 7.1.7  (2) and (10) seem somewhat redundant
>>  nothing needed

11)  Page 116, 7.1.7 (4).  I'd like to interchange the text of (4) with
that of Note 7.14.  It's a shorter list, it's more likely to be correct
as we add new intrinsics, and it's more obvious that what we disallowing
the hard math functions so users can remember the pattern, not the list.
>>  nothing needed

12)  Page 117, note 7.15.  ABS(9.0)  is now allowed.  
>>  117:23  change to "ABS (9.0)" to "ABS( (9.0, -9.0) )  !not an 
integer or real argument."

13)  Page 117,  7.1.8 last sentence of third paragraph.  Shouldn't  a
function in a FORALL mask expression also be allowed to have side
effects on the dependent statement?
>>  NO

14)  Page 118, first sentence after note 7.16.  Is this true for
polymorphic things?  Something like
   poly_1 .operator. poly_f(poly_2 .other_operator. poly_3)
>>  defer

15)  Doesn't the evaluation of the argument to poly_f in general
determine the type of poly_f and hence the type of the final expression?
>>  defer

16)  Page 121, 7.1.8.5, sentence after note 7.27.  Don't we need words
here like in 7.1.8.3 about mathematical and computational equivalence?
Something like:       X*Z .GT. X*Y
Becomes               X*Y - X*Z  .LT. 0
Becomes               X*(Y-Z)    .LT. 0
and this might have different round off characteristics
>>  Defer

17)  Page 129, Note 7.37 continued.  This isn't a continuation of the
previous part of the note.  It should be a separate note with an
introductory sentence about how defined operators have separate
precedences.  Also the words about .starstar. duplicating the ** seem
like the wrong words since it doesn't duplicate ** because it has a
different precedence.
>>  129:1 make into a new note, not a continuation. 
    129:2 delete "For example, " and capitalize

18)  Page 129, 7.5.1.2  (2)  If variable is not polymorphic can it have
a dynamic type?
>>  nothing needed

19)  Page 129, 7.5.1.2  (2)  Should the first line say dynamic and the
last declared?  Doesn't that mix things?
>>  defer

20)  Page 129, 7.1.5.2.  The last sentence defining derived type
intrinsic assignment appears to be restating (1) and (2) above, but the
words are somewhat different.  For example is "accessible defined
assignment" in (2) different from "no accessible generic interface ..."
For example, (2) in 7.3.2 goes into detail about where an interface may
come from and its typeboundness.  Should that apply here?  Or does "not
polymorphic" cover it?
>>  defer

21)  Page 130, 7.5.1.3.  Do we need to distinguish details about where
the interface is at ala (2) in 7.3.2?
>>  defer

22)  Page 131, paragraph after note 7.43, the middle clause about
nonpointer, nonallocatable.  Does this mean that derived type assignment
that is NOT type bound to the host type isn't used for the innards?
Suppose I have a type PERSON with a component of type KIDS and with a
subroutine that meets the requirements for KID_1 = KID_2.  If I do
PERSON_1 = PERSON_2
does the generic subroutine every get invoked?  Does it depend on
whether or not there is a type-bound assignment interface/routine in
PERSON?  Or in KIDS?  I'm asking about an old fashioned generic
assignment and how that fits in with the new type bound stuff.
Same comment for the last couple of lines in (2) on the next page.  It
reads to me that we require "type bound procedures" when I thought
generic assignment could work.
>>  defer

23)  Page 132, 7.5.1.6 (2)   Says there can be a type bound assignment
procedure in EITHER X1 or X2.  What happens if there is one in both and
they are different?
>>  defer

24)  Page 133, 7.5.2 R736  Does the second line allow something like
A%B%pointer => P or only one %?  Same question for R740
>>  defer

25)  Page 134, 7.5.2.1  Second paragraph.  Does this mean a non-polymorphic
pointer can point to a polymorphic object if the types are OK?  Or
should dynamic type be declared type.
>>  defer

26)  Page 134, 7.5.2.2, paragraph after unresolved issue.  In the last
two lines one of the proc-target terms should be proc-pointer-object.  I
think the second one.  Right now it says proc-target may be elemental
even if proc-target isn't.
>>  defer

27)  Page 136, C728.  I read this to say that an elsewhere in a named
WHERE does not have to be named, but if it is, the name must be the same
as the WHERE.  It seems odd to require the endwhere to be named if the
where is, but not the elsewhere.
>>  defer

28)  Page 137, 7.5.3.2 (2).  This means that the elsewhere mask
expression is FULLY evaluated without being masked out.  I think this is
surprising and probably not what we intended.  In something like
      WHERE (X  == 0 )
             ...
      ELSEWHERE ( 1/X > 10)      ! evaluated for all of X
                ...
      ENDWHERE
The same comment applies to a nested WHERE.  This came up on (I think)
the comp-f90 e-mail reflector and probably should be an F95 interpretation.
