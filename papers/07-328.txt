Subject:     Interpretation request for IEEE_IS_NAN
Date: 2007 November 07


NUMBER: F03/00xx
TITLE: Is IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN consistent with the other IEEE_SUPPORT
       functions
KEYWORDS: IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN, IEEE support functions
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress


QUESTION:
The restriction of IEEE_IS_NAN requires that IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN returns
the value true.  The restrictions for the similar functions
IEEE_IS_FINITE, NEGATIVE, NORMAK} all require that
IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE be true.  This is a much stronger restriction.

Should IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN also require that IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE
return true?
