Subject:   FAILED_IMAGES intrinsic in TS 18508
From:      Van Snyder & Lorri Menard & Daniel Chen
Date: 2014 June 24
Reference: 14-130

1. Introduction
===============

The FAILED_IMAGES intrinsic function in subclause 7.4.12 of TS 18508
reports an array of failed image indices.  If one wants to inquire
whether a particular image has failed, one would need to use

  if ( any ( the_interesting_image == failed_images() ) ) ....

It would be convenient if one could also test whether one particular
image (or set of images) had failed (or stopped).

2. Old Proposal
===========

An intrinsic function that reports the status of one image or several
images would be more useful.

Instead of FAILED_IMAGES, provide a function IMAGE_STATUS that returns
an array of STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE, some other
processor-dependent value, or zero, for a specified set of images, or
an array of positive stopped image numbers and negative failed image
numbers (almost like FAILED_IMAGES is presently specified to do) if no
image set is specified.

3. New proposal
=====================================
Although the original proposal indeed adds the needed functionality,
it is not desired for a function returning two totally different
results based on if a particular argument (IMAGES) is present or not.
This new proposal proposes
1. keep the form of IMAGE_STATUS that returns an array of
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE, some other processor-dependent
value, or zero, for a particular image or a specified set of images.
2. Keep the original FAILED_IMAGES intrinsic function in subclause
7.4.12 of TS 18508.
3. Add a new intrinsic function STOPPED_IMAGES that returns an
array of stopped image numbers.

3. Edits to 14-130
==================

[24:19+] Insert a subclause

7.4.13a STOPPED_IMAGES ( [TEAM, KIND] )

Description: Indices of stopped images.

Class: Transformational function.

Arguments.

TEAM (optional) shall be a scalar of the type TEAM TYPE defined in the
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module. Its value shall represent an
ancestor team.

KIND (optional) shall be a scalar integer constant expression. Its
value shall be the value of a kind type parameter for the type
INTEGER. The range for integers of this kind shall be at least as
large as for default integer.

Result Characteristics.  Integer.  If KIND is present, the kind type
parameter is that specified by the value of KIND; otherwise, the kind
type parameter is KIND(0).

Result Value. If TEAM is present, its value specifies the team;
otherwise, the team specified is the current team. The elements
of the result are the values of the image indices of the stopped
images in the specified team, in numerically increasing order.

Examples. If image 3 is the only stopped image in the current team,
STOPPED_IMAGES() has the value [3].If there are no stopped images
in the current team, STOPPED_IMAGES() is a zero-sized array.

[25:20+] Insert a subclause

7.4.13b IMAGE_STATUS ( IMAGE, [TEAM] )

Description: Status of images.

Class: Elemental function.

Arguments.

IMAGE  shall be of type integer.

TEAM (optional) shall be a scalar of the type TEAM TYPE defined
in the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module. Its value shall represent
an ancestor team.

Result Characteristics.  Default integer.

Result Value.  If TEAM is present, its value specifies the team;
otherwise, the team specified is the current team. The result value is
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE if the specified image has failed,
STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE if that image has stopped, a nonzero
processor-dependent value different from STAT_FAILED_IMAGE or
STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE if some other error has occurred for that image,
and zero otherwise.

Examples. If image 3 of the current team has failed, IMAGE_STATUS ( 3 )
has the value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE.

[43:40-46] Replace with

  status = image_status ( i )
  if ( status == STAT_FAILED_IMAGE ) then
    confirm%available(i) = .false.
    cycle image
  end if
  if ( status /= 0 ) error stop
  call event_query ( confirm%event(i), count )
