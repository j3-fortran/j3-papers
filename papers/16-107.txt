In the Forward, paragraph 6 does not mention Corrigendum 3, or the
coarray TS. These should be included. (And eventually, Corrigendum 4,
though that is not published yet.)

In the Introduction, paragraph 2, secod bullet, the hyperlink of
"obsolescent" is inconsistent. An edit is provided to hyperlink one
that was missed.
