1. Edits
========

[23:3 1.4.1p1 fourth bullet, 23:12 1.4.2p1] Hyphenation (or lack
thereof) is inconsistent.  [23:3] needs three digits.  Either replace
"two-digit" with "two- or three-digit" at [23:3] and replace "two or
three digit" with "two- or three-digit" at [23:12], or replace
"two-digit" with "two or three digit" at [23:3].

JOR suggests the use of hyphens => here are the edits:

    [23:11] "s is a one or two digit" -> "s is a one- or two-digit"
    [23:12] "nn is a two or three digit" -> "nn is a two- or three-digit"

[25:1-2 1.5p2(3)] Replace "an additional" with "a" because a processor
should be required to detect any form or relationship, not just an
additional one, whatever that means.

[26:7 1.6.3p1] Insert "extension" after "compatible".

[26:13 1.6.3p2] "must" shall be "shall".

16-192 wanted [27:16 1.6.5p3 third bullet]:
  Replace "negative zero imaginary part" with "AIMAG(X) is negative
  zero" to avoid mixed metaphors.

JOR prefers the use of "negative real zero" like in [27:15]. JOR suggests:

[27:16] "REAL(X) < 0 and negative zero imaginary part" ->
        "X%RE < 0 and X%IM is negative zero"

[28:17-18 1.6.7p1 fourth bullet]:
  Replace "Therefore, some ... Fortran 2003 processors ... edit
  descriptors" with "Therefore, the form produced for certain
  combinations of values and G edit descriptors might differ
  from that produced by some {\sc Fortran} 77
  processors".


2. Edits not to be made
=======================

[22:40 1.4.1p1 first bullet] Insert "and that are not italicized" after
"(3.1)".

JOR sees no misunderstanding.  [22:42] 2nd bullet starts the exceptions
referred to in [22-40] first bullet.

[24:17-18 1.4.4p2] Delete "Expression ... (R722)." because it appears
not to have anything to do with the subject of the subclause.

JOR wants to keep [24:17-18] because they describe the syntax terms
<program-unit> and <expr>.
