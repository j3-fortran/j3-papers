NUMBER: F18/008
TITLE: Contradictory assumed-rank requirements
KEYWORDS: Assumed rank
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Paragraph 1 of subclause 8.5.8.7 (Assumed-rank entity) states that an
assumed-rank entity is a dummy data object ... or the associate name
of a RANK DEFAULT block in a SELECT RANK construct.

C837 requires an assumed-rank entity to be a dummy data object.  It
does not permit an associate name of a RANK DEFAULT block in a SELECT
RANK construct to have assumed rank.

Is an associate name of a RANK DEFAULT block in a SELECT RANK
construct permitted to have assumed rank?

ANSWER:

Yes, the associate name of a RANK DEFAULT block may have assumed rank.

An edit is supplied to remove the contradiction.

EDIT to 18-007r1:

[101:13-14 C837 in 8.5.8.7 Assumed-rank entity]

At the end of C837, after "or VALUE attribute", insert
    ", or the associate name of a RANK DEFAULT block in a SELECT RANK
     construct whose selector has assumed rank",
making the whole constraint read:

C837 An assumed-rank entity shall be a dummy data object that does not
     have the CODIMENSION or VALUE attribute, or the associate name of
     a RANK DEFAULT block in a SELECT RANK construct whose selector
     has assumed rank.
