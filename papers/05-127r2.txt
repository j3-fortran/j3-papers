STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:
Is the following program legal?

_________________________
module test_mod

contains

subroutine reference(proc,choice)
    ! Proc has implicit interface
    external :: proc ! Or
        ! procedure(), pointer :: proc
    logical :: choice
    if(choice) then
       call proc(1.0) ! Call with real argument
    else
       call proc(1) ! Call with integer argument
    end if
end subroutine

subroutine proc_real(x)
   real :: x
end subroutine

subroutine proc_integer(i)  ! respelled from original submission
                            ! without loss of generality
   integer :: i
end subroutine

end module
 
program test
   use test_mod
   call reference(proc_real,.true.)
   call reference(proc_integer,.false.)
end program

12.3.2.5 says: "The type...of dummy arguments of a procedure referenced from a scoping unit 
where the interface of  the procedure is implicit shall be such that the actual arguments 
are consistent with the characteristics of the dummy arguments."
We define a procedure reference in 2.5.6 as the "appearance of  procedure designator,
... in a context requiring execution at that point."

Are both calls to proc above references, at compile time?
If both calls to proc are references than they both need to be consistent with the interface of the
actual argument associated with the dummy procedure. This is not possible and the program would be
illegal. However, if only the call executed counts as a reference, than the program is legal.

The same question applies to both dummy procedures and procedure pointers with implicit interfaces.

ANSWER:

Technically, the question is ill-formed in asking whether the calls are references "at compile time".  
The standard does not have a notion of compile-time.

The calls to proc are indeed references according to the
definition in 2.5.6.  This is a purely syntactic notion since a call-stmt is an example of
"a context requiring execution at that point" and proc is the procedure designator in
	call proc(1.0)  
and
	call proc(1)


12.3.2.5 specifies a requirement, violations of which are not required to be detected at compile-time
(12.3.2.5 is not a constraint).  Every line of the program when it is actually executed by a standard-conforming
processor uses only forms and relationships defined by the standard [2:9-10], and the
program has an interpretation according to the standard.   This program was intended to be
standard conforming.

However, the current language of 12.3.2.5 is confusing.
The requirement on the type of dummy arguments must be laid on the procedure actually invoked
and not on the procedure named in the procedure reference.  A procedure with only an implicit
interface has no nominal dummy arguments on which a requirement can be levied!  (Ask yourself:
what are the names of the dummy argument(s) of proc ?)  Put another way, in
	call proc(1.0)
proc is a "procedure reference" but proc_real is actually the procedure referenced.
An edit is supplied to make this clearer.

EDITS:

In [266:8-9] change "of a procedure referenced from a scoping unit where
the interface of the procedure is implicit"  

to
		"of a procedure invoked in a scoping unit
from a procedure reference with implicit interface"
