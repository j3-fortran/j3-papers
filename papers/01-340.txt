TITLE: End-of-record and PAD
KEYWORDS: End-of-record, PAD
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

Subclause 9.4.3 specifies:

  If an end-of-record condition occurs during execution of a nonadvancing
  input statement, the following occurs: if the PAD= specifier has the
  value YES, the record is padded with blanks (9.4.4.4.2) to satisfy the
  input list item and corresponding data edit descriptor that require
  more characters than the record contains;

There appears to be a problem if a list item does not correspond to
exactly one edit descriptor.

QUESTION:

If an End-of-record condition occurs during execution of a nonadvancing
input statement and the PAD= specifier has the value YES

  (1) do enough blanks get supplied for the next data edit descriptor
      and whatever part of the list item corresponds to that edit
      descriptor, or
  (2) do enough blanks get supplied for the remainder of the list item
      and as many edit descriptors as necessary, or
  (3) do enough blanks get supplied to process the rest of the input
      list?
