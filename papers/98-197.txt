          All references in the following are to 98-007r2.

          The rules of Fortran 95 allow a processor to infer that the
          variable A, in the following example, will not be modified
          by the reference to the subroutine SUB2.

                program p
                  integer :: a, b
                  call sub1(a)
                  a = 3
                  call sub2
                  b = a
                  print *, b
                end program p

          In other words, the above program could be treated as if it
          were the following program:

                program p
                  integer :: a
                  call sub1(a)
                  call sub2
                  print *, 3
                end program p

          In C, the following similar program cannot be

                main()
                {
                  int a, b;

                  sub1(&a);
                  a = 3;
                  sub2;
                  b = a;
                  printf("%d\n", b);
                }

          be treated as if it were the following program:

                main()
                {
                  int a;

                  sub1(&a);
                  sub2;
                  printf("%d\n", 3);
                }

          Subgroup does not believe C's liberal rules should be
          permitted to affect Fortran.  In order to prohibit this,
          only variables that have the TARGET attribute, that have the
          BIND(C) attribute or that appear as actual arguments in the
          reference will be permitted to become defined, undefined or
          redefined by a reference to a procedure that has the BIND(C)
          attribute.  This will prevent a C function from copying the
          address of a Fortran variable for later use, unless it has
          the TARGET attribute or is global.

          The problem is that these rules are awkward to specify
          within the existing framework.  Currently, the standard
          doesn't talk about how a procedure reference might cause
          variables to be affected.  Instead, it talks about how
          Fortran statements cause variables to become defined or
          undefined or to be referenced (14.7).  These rules have the
          effect that a processor can treat a Fortran subprogram that
          defines a procedure as if it caused arbitrary, valid Fortran
          statements to be executed, in order to determine which
          variables might become defined or undefined and which
          variables might be referenced.

          A reference to a C function does not cause any Fortran
          statements to be executed (unless the function in turn
          references a Fortran subprogram), but the definition status
          of variables may be affected by such a procedure reference.
          Strictly speaking, there is no way to deal with the issue
          without a joint C/Fortran standard.  Instead, we will simply
          expand section 12.5.3, "Definition of procedures by means
          other than Fortran", to specify which variables might have
.         their definition affected by a reference to such a procedure.


          C_LOC
          -----

          A function, C_LOC, shall be accessible from the ISO_C_TYPES
          module.  The function shall have one dummy argument.  The
          actual argument shall have the TARGET attribute.  The result
          shall be a scalar of type C_PTR.
