  <FORTREQ>
  <NUMBER> 115
  <TITLE> Mixed function/subroutine generics
  <KEYWORDS> GENERIC
  <STATUS> Registered
  <TARGET>
  <SUBGROUP> 
  <VERSION> 1

  <REQUIREMENT>
  Allow generic names (but not operators or assignment) to apply to functions
  and subroutines at the same time, with function vs. subroutine being an
  added way to distinguish two specific procecures.

  Review whether intrinsics such as MVBITS, PACK, and UNPACK should have both
  function and subroutine interfaces.

  <JUSTIFICATION>
  Subroutine interfaces can be more efficient if only part of what could be
  modified will actually be modified in a given call.  Functions are more
  suited for allowing operations to be composed.  Allowing both interfaces
  to be provided avoids the necessity of prejudging which issue is going to
  be most important in the programs of people using the interface.

  <ESTIMATED IMPACT>
  Impact on both the document and existing processors should be localized.
  (Some existing processors already have generic intrinsics that mix
  functions and subroutines.)
