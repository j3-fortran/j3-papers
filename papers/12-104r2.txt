Subject: Interpretation concerning pure procedures in intrinsic modules
From: Van Snyder
Date: 2012 February 14

Several procedures in IEEE_Arithmetic are specified to be pure, but
the definition of purity in 12.7p1 does not admit the possibility
that procedures that are neither intrinsic nor defined by pure
subprograms can be pure.

Several procedures in ISO_Fortran_Env and ISO_C_Binding are not
specified to be pure, but there appears not to be any reason for them
to be impure.

NUMBER: F08/0065
TITLE: Should certain procedures in intrinsic modules be pure?
KEYWORDS: pure, intrinsic, intrinsic module
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Under J3 consideration

QUESTION:

1.  12.7 doesn't allow a procedure in an intrinsic module to be pure
    unless it's actually defined by a pure subprogram (as opposed to
    being provided by the processor).  Nonetheless, some of the
    procedures in IEEE_Arithmetic are specified to be pure.  How can
    they be pure?

2.  The COMPILER_OPTIONS and COMPILER_VERSION functions in the
    intrinsic module ISO_Fortran_env are not described as being pure,
    but there is no apparent reason for any of them to be impure.
    Were they intended to be pure?

3.  The procedures in ISO_C_Binding are not specified to be pure, but
    there is no apparent reason for any of them to be impure.  Were
    they intended to be pure?

ANSWER:

1.  The list in subclause 12.7, paragraph 1, is incomplete.  An edit
    is supplied to correct it.

2.  The procedures were intended to be pure.  An edit is supplied to
    correct this oversight.

3.  The procedures were intended to be pure.  An edit is supplied to
    correct this oversight.

EDITS:

1: [12.7p1 312:12+] Insert a list item
" o a module procedure in an intrinsic module, if it is specified to
    be pure,"

2: [13.8.2.1p2 397:7] Append a sentence to the paragraph:
"The module procedures described in 13.8.2 are pure."

3: [15.2.3.1p1 426:15] Append a sentence to the paragraph:
"The module procedures described in 15.2.3 are pure."
