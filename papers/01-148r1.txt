NUMBER: 000018
TITLE: ELEMENTAL procedures with no arguments
KEYWORDS: Elemental, procedure
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

Section 12.7.2 of IS 1539-1:1997 seems to assume there is at least one
argument to an elemental procedure.  The semantics of the following
examples do not seem to be clearly specified.

Example 1:
      ELEMENTAL INTEGER FUNCTION f()
        f = 0
      END

Example 2:
      ELEMENTAL INTEGER FUNCTION g(i,j)
        INTEGER,INTENT(IN) :: i,j
        g = i + j
      END

Example 3:
      ELEMENTAL INTEGER FUNCTION h(i)
        INTEGER,INTENT(IN),OPTIONAL :: i
        h = i
      END

Example 4:
      ELEMENTAL SUBROUTINE s()
        REAL x,y,z
        x = 0
        y = 0
        z = x/y
      END

QUESTION 1:
What is the shape of a reference to function F in example 1?  Is it scalar?

QUESTION 2:
If G() is referenced as G(iscalar,jarray(1:0)), the result is a zero-sized
array.  Is "iscalar" referenced (need it be defined)?
Is the body of G() executed?

QUESTION 3:
What is the shape of a reference to H() if the argument is textually
not present?

QUESTION 4:
When subroutine S is invoked, how many times is it executed?
Is this example standard-conforming, or may a processor raise a
divide-by-zero exception?

ANSWER:

(1) Yes, A reference to F() is intended to be scalar.
    A clarifying edit is supplied.

(2) It is not possible to tell, in Fortran 95, whether the body of G() is
    executed, so that part of the question has no answer.
    [no edit required]
    Yes, ISCALAR must be defined; this is the same situation as writing
      ISCALAR + JARRAY(1:0)
    directly, with no user-defined ELEMENTAL procedure being used.
    [no edit required]

(3) If the I argument to H is textually absent, a reference to H returns a
    scalar result (cf. answer to question 1).  Note that execution of this
    procedure is not standard-conforming if the optional argument is not
    present.  The "H = I" line should be replaced by
      IF (PRESENT(I)) THEN
        H = I
      ELSE
        H = 0 ! or some other desired scalar value
      END IF
    [no edit required]

(4) The intention was that the subroutine is executed once per invocation.
    This is not clear from the standard; an edit is supplied to correct this
    oversight.
    However, the example is not standard-conforming on a processor whose
    arithmetic does not allow division by zero.
    [no edit required]

EDITS:

[206:10+] Insert
          "A reference to an elemental subroutine is not an elemental reference
           if the subroutine has no arguments present."
{Specify zero-argument elemental subroutine reference.}

[214:28] After "If" insert "there are no actual arguments or".
{Clarify zero-argument elemental function reference.}
