Flang Open Source Fortran Report
================================

Flang is an open source compiler for Fortran.  It is an official
subproject of the LLVM Project (llvm.org).  NVIDIA's portion of the work
is partially sponsored by the US Department of Energy
Exascale Computing Project (particularly, LLNL, Sandia and LANL).

The current goals of the project are to
    - Create  an open source Fortran compiler with
      LLVM  licensing,
    - that can be used for language and parallelization
      experimentation,
    - that exists as a peer in the LLVM community of languages,
      like Clang,
    - that can rely on LLVM code generation and parallelism
      support for CPUs and GPUs.

There is a Slack workspace for Flang and a number of conference calls
related to Flang development.
    - Flang biweekly sync call ("umbrella call")
    - Flang biweekly technical call
    - "Classic Flang" biweekly call
    - OpenMP in Flang Technical Call

The New LLVM Flang Compiler
---------------------------

The new front-end is available at https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project
(the LLVM monorepo) in the flang/ directory. 

LLVM Flang is being developed under the LLVM license with LLVM
exceptions (the same as LLVM, Clang, OpenMP, etc.).

Recent efforts have concentrated on
* F2003 Polymorphic Entities. An implementation design document has been
  completed and implementation has begun.
* F2003 Parameterized Derived Types (PDTs). An implementation design
  document has been completed.
* Flang Parser/Semantic Analyzer (Front-End) development.
* Testing. NVIDIA runs approximately 15,500 tests on Flang nightly. More
  than 85% of the tests are from the Numerical Algorithms Group (NAG). 
   
Flang Front-End Work that has been completed in Q3 (i.e., between July
1, 2022 and September 30, 2022):

Development of Fortran semantic analysis continues. This quarter saw fewer
patches in semantic analysis compared to Q2 (31 patches compared to 83 in
Q2 which was the time period between April 1, 2022 and June 30, 2022). We
now have better regression testing that can be used to catch problems
before a patch is committed into the Github repository. This led to fewer
patches needed for Flang's parser/semantic analyzer development.

Flang Lowering work that has been completed in Q3 (i.e., between 
July 1, 2022 and September 30, 2022):

Note: Lowering is the translation of Fortran syntax into the 
semantic-based Fortran IR (FIR), which is a superset of LLVM's MLIR,
and then into LLVM IR.

Lowering features completed in Q3 include:
New work (42 patches):

* Work on design documents and documentation (6 patches):
  - Polymorphic entities
  - Adding guideline to write design docs
  - Design doc for parameterized derived types (PDTs)
  - Document the Intrinsic Types

    lowering

   aligning with the newer llvm base ) (11 patches)
  - Upstreaming the last bits
  - Adapting lowering to upstream changes regarding opaque pointers and 
    MLIR GEP
  - Updating build documentation

  - Support optional pointer TARGET argument in ASSOCIATED

  - Build fix

Runtime Changes in Q3 (i.e., between July 1, 2022 and 
September 30, 2022):
    
The Flang runtime support library became more stable this quarter. This
meant fewer patches (i.e., 11 runtime related patches in Q3 compared to
68 in Q2). 

The current state of the LLVM Flang compiler is
    - written in modern C++ following LLVM conventions
    - over 200,000 lines of code, tests and scripts
    - parses all of Fortran 2018 to abstract syntax trees (AST)
    - parses  OpenMP 4.5 and some OpenMP 5.0
    - parses OpenACC 3.0
    - defines a "Fortran Intermediate Representation" (FIR) based on
      LLVM's MLIR
    - can lower most OpenMP and OpenACC constructs
    - can compile and correctly run Fortran 77 programs (passes FCVS
      test suite) and nearly all Fortran 95 programs.
    - supports end-to-end compilation of all OpenMP 1.1 except for 
      reduction, privatization, and one atomic construct.
    - for later versions of OpenMP, Flang has support for simd, task, 
      taskgroup etc.  

Upcoming work:

* Develop an implementation design document for the F2008 Block construct. 
* Continue to address runtime errors that are not blocked by 
  not-yet-implemented messages and are not covered by the in-progress 
  design documents.
* Work on adding OpenMP target-related and loop transformation constructs
  is in progress.
    
Current ("Classic") Flang Compiler
----------------------------------

The previous version of Flang, now known as Classic Flang, is derived from
the PGI Fortran compiler, with some proprietary features removed (e.g.,
OpenACC support, inter-procedure analysis). It is the basis for commercial
Fortran compilers from Arm, AMD, and Huawei.

Classic Flang is available for Linux on x86-64, OpenPOWER, and Arm
processors. OpenPower support is not currently being maintained but it is
still available. 

The Classic Flang Community has made progress with bug fixes and new 
versions of LLVM. Classic Flang works with LLVM 14 and LLVM 15 support is
in progress. Support for Mac and Windows architectures, quad-precision, 
and improved debug support are also in progress.


The Classic Flang Community has also switched to a rotating mechanism for 
organizing its technical call between Arm, AMD and Huawei. Pawel 
Osmialowski, Shivarama Rao, and Bryan Chan respectively now run the 
technical calls.
