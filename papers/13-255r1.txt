Subject:   J3 Fortran interp letter ballot #28 - due 19-Apr-2013
Date: 12-Mar-2013

r1: remove F03/0053 from ballot - it has already passed J3 LB #27

Enclosed in the next letter ballot on Fortran interpretations.

The rules by which we operate say:

    o   J3 votes on the answer at a J3 meeting; a simple majority
        vote marks the answer as "passed by J3 meeting".

    o   Between J3 meetings the chair of /interp sends a J3 letter
        ballot to J3 to approve interp answers that have been "passed
        by J3 meeting".  The letter ballot runs for 30 days.  Not
        voting on three of four consecutive J3 letter ballots is
        grounds to terminate J3 membership.  An interp answer passes
        by a 2/3rds vote;  a no vote must be accompanied by an
        explanation of the changes necessary to change the member's
        vote to yes.

        J3/interp reserves the right to recall an interp answer for
        more study even if the answer passes.

12 Fortran interpretations are currently "Passed by J3 meeting" after
J3 meeting #200.  This is the letter ballot phase to go from "Passed
by J3 meeting" to "Passed by J3 letter ballot".

The following Fortran interpretations are being balloted:

NUMBER: F03/0030
TITLE:  IEEE divide by zero
KEYWORDS: IEEE-754, divide-by-zero
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Is infinity / 0.0 a divide by zero exception?
Is NaN / 0.0 a divide by zero exception?

Fortran 2003 defines (in 14.2) infinity / zero and NaN / zero
cases as IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO.  IEEE-754 defines (in 6.1 and 6.2)
those two as unexceptional.

ANSWER:

On an IEEE-conformant processor, these cases do not raise exceptions
(see clauses 6.1 and 6.2 of IEC 60559:1989).

The definitions in 14.2 were intended to describe IEC 60559:1989
exceptions with sufficient latitude to allow use on machines that do
not conform to IEC 60559:1989.  However, the definition of
IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO is not consistent with IEC 60559:1989.

Furthermore, the definition of the IEEE_OVERFLOW flag is also not
consistent with IEC 60559:1989, because this exception is not raised
for operations on infinite operands.

Additionally, if the data type is not an IEEE data type, but the
exception is supported, the circumstances under which the exception is
raised are processor dependent.

Edits are provided.

TITLE: Polymorphic arguments to intrinsic procedures
KEYWORDS: polymorphism, intrinsic procedures
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

The descriptions of the intrinsic procedures often use the term "type"
without qualification.  It is unclear whether they mean "declared
type" or "dynamic type".  If they mean "dynamic type", then this would
appear to allow unlimited polymorphic arguments to intrinsic
procedures like ABS and SIN.  Resolution of generic intrinsic
procedures in this case would create an undue (and likely unintended)
burden on the processor, and the declared type of the result of such a
function call would be unclear as well.

Question 1:
Are the arguments of the intrinsic functions ALLOCATED, ASSOCIATED,
LBOUND, SHAPE, SIZE, and UBOUND permitted to be polymorphic?

Question 2:
(a) Is the ARRAY argument of the intrinsic function CSHIFT permitted
    to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If the argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?  What
    are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 3:
(a) Are the ARRAY and BOUNDARY arguments of the intrinsic function
    EOSHIFT permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, then must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on their types refer to their declared types
    or dynamic types?
(d) If either argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic? What
    are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 4:
(a) Are the A and MOLD arguments of the intrinsic function
    EXTENDS_TYPE_OF permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on their types refer to their declared types
    or dynamic types?

Question 5:
(a) Are the TSOURCE and FSOURCE arguments of the intrinsic function
    MERGE permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on the types of the arguments refer to their
    declared types or dynamic types?
(d) If either argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 6:
Are the FROM and TO arguments of the intrinsic function MOVE_ALLOC
permitted to be polymorphic?

Question 7:
(a) Are the ARRAY and VECTOR arguments of the intrinsic function PACK
    permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on the types of the arguments refer to their
    declared types or dynamic types?
(d) If either argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 8:
(a) Are the SOURCE and PAD arguments of the intrinsic function RESHAPE
    permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on the types of the arguments refer to their
    declared types or dynamic types?
(d) If either argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 9:
(a) Are the A and B arguments of the intrinsic function SAME_TYPE_AS
    permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on their types refer to their declared types
    or dynamic types?

Question 10:
(a) Is the SOURCE argument of the intrinsic function SPREAD permitted
    to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If the argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?  What
    are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 11:
(a) Is the SOURCE argument of the intrinsic function TRANSFER
    permitted to be polymorphic?
(b) Is the MOLD argument of the intrinsic function TRANSFER permitted
    to be polymorphic?
If the answer to (b) is yes:
(c) If the MOLD argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 12:
(a) Is the MATRIX argument of the intrinsic function TRANSPOSE
    permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If the argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?  What
    are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 13:
(a) Are the VECTOR and FIELD arguments of the intrinsic function
    UNPACK permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on the types of the arguments refer to their
    declared types or dynamic types?
(d) If either argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 14:
Are any of the other arguments of any intrinsic procedure permitted to
be polymorphic?

ANSWER:

The assertion that it is unclear whether "type" means declared, dynamic, or
both, is misguided.  The general rule is that wherever it makes sense, it
means both.  Where only one meaning makes sense, it means that one.  Where
only one meaning is intended but it would otherwise not be clear from
context, it is qualified as "declared type" or "dynamic type".

Answer 1:
Yes.

Answer 2:
(a) Yes.
(b) Yes.  "The result is of the type ... of ARRAY".

Answer 3:
(a) Yes.
(b) No.
(c) The requirements apply to both the declared type and the dynamic
    type.
(d) "The type has ... the type ... of ARRAY".  Therefore it is polymorphic
    if ARRAY is polymorphic.

Answer 4:
(a) Yes.
(b) No.
(c) The requirements refer to the declared type; this is explicitly
    stated.

Answer 5:
(a) Yes.
(b) No.
(c) The requirements refer to both the declared type and the dynamic
    type.  Note that this means that if only one argument is polymorphic,
    it is required to have the same dynamic type as the declared type.
(d) The result characteristics are the "Same as TSOURCE", therefore it is
    polymorphic if TSOURCE is polymorphic.

Answer 6:
Yes.

Answer 7:
(a) Yes.
(b) No.
(c) The requirements refer to both the declared type and the dynamic
    type.  Note that this means that if either ARRAY or VECTOR is not
    polymorphic, the requirement for type matching means that the
    dynamic type of the polymorphic argument is known.
(d) The result "has the same type" as ARRAY, and therefore is polymorphic
    if ARRAY is polymorphic.

Answer 8:
(a) Yes.
(b) No.
(c) The requirements refer to both the declared type and the dynamic
    type.
(d) The result "has the same type" as SOURCE, and therefore is polymorphic
    if and only if SOURCE is polymorphic.

Answer 9:
(a) Yes.
(b) No.
(c) The requirements are explicitly stated to refer to the declared type.

Answer 10:
(a) Yes.
(b) Yes.  "The result is ... of the same type ... as ARRAY.".

Answer 11:
(a) Yes.
(b) Yes.
(c) "The result is of the same type ... as MOLD.".

Answer 12:
(a) Yes.
(b) Yes.

Answer 13:
(a) Yes.
(b) Yes.
(c) The requirements refer to both the declared type and the dynamic
    type.
(d) The result has the same type as VECTOR.

Answer 14:
Yes.  For example, IMAGE_INDEX, LCOBOUND, PRESENT, STORAGE_SIZE, and
UCOBOUND.

NUMBER: F03/0064
TITLE: Recursive declaration of procedure interfaces
KEYWORDS: procedure, interface
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Q1. Consider the following program:

      PROGRAM foo
        PROCEDURE(sub) :: p
        INTERFACE
          SUBROUTINE sub(p2)
            IMPORT p
            PROCEDURE(p) :: p2
          END SUBROUTINE
        END INTERFACE
      END PROGRAM

C1216 appears to prohibit the case of an interface name in a procedure
declaration statement being the name of something declared in a later
procedure declaration statement.  But it does not appear to prohibit
the case of an interface name being the name of something declared in
a later interface body.

In the above program, the characteristics of p rely on the
characteristics of sub.  The characteristics of sub, in turn, rely on
the characteristics of p.

Is this program standard-conforming?

Q2. Consider the module

    MODULE m1
    CONTAINS
      SUBROUTINE s(p)
        PROCEDURE(s) :: p
      END SUBROUTINE
    END MODULE

Constraint C1216 does not apply here since "s" is not declared by a
procedure declaration statement; unlike Q1, it is also not declared by
an interface body.  However, the characteristics of S have not been
determined before the procedure declaration statement has been
processed, and that cannot be processed until we know what the
interface of S is.

Is this program unit standard-conforming?

Q3. Consider the module

    MODULE m2
    CONTAINS
      SUBROUTINE s1(a)
        PROCEDURE(s2) :: a
      END SUBROUTINE
      SUBROUTINE s2(b)
        PROCEDURE(s1) :: b
      END SUBROUTINE
    END MODULE

The interface of A depends on the interface of S2, which depends on
the characteristics of B, which depends on the characteristics of S1,
which depends on the characteristics of A; a circular dependency.

Is this program unit standard-conforming?

Q4. Consider

      MODULE m3
        PROCEDURE(s),POINTER :: sptr
      CONTAINS
        SUBROUTINE s(p)
          PROCEDURE(sptr) :: p
        END SUBROUTINE
      END MODULE

In the normal course of events there is no problem declaring a
procedure pointer to have the interface of a module procedure that is
defined later, and this is desirable, but in this case there seems to
be a circular dependency between the characteristics of sptr, s, and
p.

Is this program unit standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

None of the examples are standard-conforming, as the standard does not
establish an interpretation for them.

An edit is provided to clarify this.

EDIT to 10-007r1:

[288:3] 12.4.3.6p2, append new sentence
  "The interface specified by <interface-name> shall not depend on any
   characteristic of a procedure identified by a
   <procedure-entity-name> in the <proc-decl-list> of the same
   procedure declaration statement."

TITLE: Error in field width for special cases of signed INFINITY
       output
KEYWORDS: formatted output, signed infinity
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Is there an error in the description for the output of a IEEE infinity
with a sign and a field width of 3 or 8?

Fortran 2008, 10.7.2.3.2 paragraph 7, [252:33-34], describes the
output of IEEE infinities; this specifies asterisks (field overflow) if
the field width is less than 3, and omission of "inity" if the field
width is less than 8.  However, this does not take into account the
fact that there might be a plus or minus sign in the field.

The current text also fails to take into account the case of <w> = 0,
for both Infinity and NaN values.

ANSWER:

Yes, there is an error in the special cases.  Edits are provided to
correctly describe the required field widths for signed infinities.
An edit is also provided to repair the description of the output of
NaN values.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[252:33-34] 10.7.2.3.2p7, Replace "If <w> is ... produced." with

  "The minimum field width required for output of the form 'Inf' is 3
   if no sign is produced, and 4 otherwise.  If <w> is greater than
   zero but less than the minimum required, the field is filled with
   asterisks.  The minimum field width for output of the form
   'Infinity' is 8 if no sign is produced and 9 otherwise.  If <w> is
   zero or <w> is less than the minimum required but large enough to
   produce the form 'Inf', the form 'Inf' is output."

[252:37] Same subclause, p8, Replace "If <w> ... askerisks." with

  "If <w> is greater than zero and less than 3, the field is filled
   with asterisks.  If <w> is zero, the output field is 'NaN'.".

NUMBER: F03/0139
TITLE: Functions returning procedure pointers
KEYWORDS: procedure pointer
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

(1) Is a function permitted to return a procedure pointer?
    Much of the language talks about the function result variable,
    but a procedure pointer is not a variable.  For example, 2.2.3
    says [12:16]
       "The VARIABLE that returns the value of a function is called
        the RESULT VARIABLE."
    (emphasis mine); which indicates that the value of a function is
    returned in a variable.

(2) Where may a function reference that returns a procedure pointer
    appear?  In particular,
    (a) as a <selector> in a SELECT TYPE or an ASSOCIATE statement;
    (b) within parentheses as a primary;
    (c) as the argument to an intrinsic inquiry function such as
        KIND or LEN.

(3) [12:18-19] says
      "a subroutine may be used to change the program state by
       changing the values of any of the data objects accessible
       to the subroutine".
    A procedure pointer is not a data object, so is this meant to
    imply that a subroutine is not permitted to change the state of a
    procedure pointer?  Similar text for functions appears in the same
    paragraph.

ANSWER:

(1b) Yes, a function is permitted to return a procedure pointer; the
     text calling this a variable is in error.  Edits are supplied to
     correct these mistakes.

(2b) It was intended that a function reference that returns a
     procedure pointer only be permitted as an argument to the
     ASSOCIATED and NULL intrinsic functions and in places where an
     ordinary procedure name would be acceptable.  Parentheses around
     a pointer act to dereference the pointer and return a copy of the
     value: this action is inapplicable to procedures. Thus the
     answers to the specific sub-questions are No, No, and No again.
     Clarifying edits are provided.

(3) No, this implication is not intended.  A clarifying edit is
    provided.

TITLE: Vector subscript target
KEYWORDS: Pointer assignment, Vector subscript
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Consider

  PROGRAM m197006
    REAL,TARGET :: x(100) = [ (i,i=1,100) ]
    REAL,POINTER :: p(:)
    TYPE t
      REAL,POINTER :: q(:)
    END TYPE
    TYPE(t) y
    p => x                     ! (1)
    y = t(x)                   ! (2)
    p => x( [ 1,4,9,25 ] )     ! (3)
    y = t(x( [ 1,4,9,25 ] ))   ! (4)
    PRINT *,y%q
  END PROGRAM

The pointer assignment statement at (1) associates P with X.
The intrinsic assignment statement at (2) includes the effect of
pointer assignment of X to Y%Q, but is not a pointer assignment
statement.

The pointer assignment statement at (3) is not standard-conforming
according to 6.5.3.3.2 paragraph 2:
  "An array section with a vector subscript shall not be
   ... the <data-target> in a pointer assignment statement"

However, the intrinsic assignment statement at (4) is not subject to
this requirement as it is not a pointer assignment statement.

Note that the quoted paragraph is entirely  duplicative, as in:
 - the first bullet item is covered by 12.5.2.4p18,
 - the second bullet item is covered by C724 in 7.2.2.2
   (but C724 does not cover this case either),
 - the third bullet item is covered by C901 in 9.5.1.
Editorial improvements have been made in corrigendum 1.  The entire
paragraph has been rewritten.

Q1. Was the statement marked (4) intended to be allowed?

Q2. If not, was it intended to be prohibited by a constraint like
    C724, or was it intended to be a simple requirement?
    (Editorial note: in any case surely the requirement should appear
    in the pointer assignment subclause.)

ANSWER:

A1. No, this was not intended.  An edit is supplied to correct this.

A2. Constraint C724 was intended to cover this case.  An edit is
    supplied to correct this.

EDIT:

[158:19-20] In 7.2.2.2 Syntax of the pointer assignment statement,
            C724, change ""(R737) A <variable>"
            to "A variable that is a pointer target",
            making the whole constraint read:
  "A variable that is a pointer target shall have either the TARGET
   or POINTER attribute, and shall not be an array section with a
   vector subscript."
{Make the constraint apply to all forms of pointer assignment.}

{Notice that this edit incorporates the list item concerning vector
subscripts from 6.5.3.3.2p2 status quo ante corrigendum 1.}

NUMBER: F08/0085
TITLE: Problems with PARAMETERs
KEYWORDS: PARAMETER
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

(1) Consider the program fragment

    Subroutine s
      Parameter (n=1)
      Integer :: x,n       !(A)
      Parameter (x=3)

    The type declaration statement marked "!(A)", declares the
    entities X and N to be of type INTEGER.  Furthermore, as we see by
    the immediately preceding and following PARAMETER statements, both
    X and N are named constants.

    Unfortunately, a constraint says
      C507 (R503) "An <initialization> shall appear if the entity is a
                   named constant (5.3.13)."
    (BTW, R503 is <entity-decl>.)

    Therefore one concludes that the type declaration statement marked
    "!(A)" is not conforming as it violates C507 for both X and N.

    Is this statement intended to be conforming?

(2) Firstly, consider

    Subroutine s2(n)
      Integer,Parameter :: x(n:n+1) = [ 1,2 ]
      Character(n),Parameter :: y = 'abc'
      ...

    The type declaration statements are not conforming because
    according to 5.2.2p1, X and Y are automatic data objects, and C506
    says that <initialization> shall not appear in that case.

    Now consider

    Subroutine s2b(n)
      Implicit Character(n) (a-z)
      Parameter (y = 'abc')
      Integer :: x(n:n+1)
      Parameter(x=[1,2])

    This is not valid Fortran 2003, because 5.2 contains the
    requirement:
      "The combination of attributes that may be specified for a
       particular entity is subject to the same restrictions as for
       type declaration statements regardless of the method of
       specification.  This also applies to PROCEDURE, EXTERNAL, and
       INTRINSIC statements."

    This requirement does not appear in F2008.  However, there is no
    indication in the Introduction of this new feature.

    Is this extension to Fortran 2003 deliberate?

ANSWER:

(1) Yes, the type declaration statement was intended to be allowed.
    An edit is supplied to correct this mistake.

(2) No, the omission of this requirement was inadvertent.  An edit
    is supplied to correct this mistake.

EDITS:

[88:14] In 5.2.1, Replace constraint "C507 (503)" completely with
  "C507 (R501) If the PARAMETER keyword appears, <initialization>
        shall appear in each <entity-decl>."
{Fix Q1.}

[88:14+] In 5.2.1, immediately after constraint C507, insert new
         constraint:

         expression."

NUMBER: F08/0086
TITLE: 	Implied-shape and separate PARAMETER statement
KEYWORDS: Implied-shape, PARAMETER
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification or Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Q1.  Consider

  Program test1
    Character(*) a,b(*)
    Dimension c(*)
    Parameter (a='123', b=['1','2','3'])
    Character(*),Parameter :: c = [ '44','55','66' ]
    Print *,a,b,c
  End

The definition of the assumed-length character named constant A
conforms to Fortran 77 to Fortran 2008.  However, the definition of
the implied-shape named constant B appears not to conform to Fortran
2008, as the standard says in 5.4.11p2
  "A named array constant defined by a PARAMETER statement shall have
   its shape specified in a prior specification statement."
On the other hand, the named constant C does not have such a
requirement, so its definition would appear to be conforming.

This apparent requirement on the named constant B would thus appear to
be inconsistent with those on the named constant C, as well as
inconsistent with the way that assumed length works, and with the
general principle of allowing attributes to be specified either in a
single type declaration statement or with separate specification
statements.

Is the program intended to conform to the Fortran standard?

Q2. Consider

  Subroutine test2(a)
    Real,Dimension(*) :: a,c
    Parameter (c = [ 45.6 ])
    a(b) = c
  End Subroutine

The <array-spec> in the type declaration statement is ambiguous; if it
is an <implied-shape-spec> then the declaration of A as an
assumed-size array is erroneous, but if it is an <assumed-size-spec>
then the declaration of B as an implied-shape array is erroneous.

Is this program-unit intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

A1. Yes, the program was intended to conform to the Fortran standard.
    An edit is provided to modify the requirement for prior
    specification so as to allow this case.

A2. Yes, the program is intended to conform to the Fortran standard.
    An edit is provided to add syntax to permit this unambiguously.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[94:10] 5.3.8.1, R515,
        Change "<implied-shape-spec-list>" to "<implied-shape-spec>".
{This will be the unambiguous implied-shape syntax.}

[95:33] After "<<is>>" insert "<explicit-shape-spec>,".

   C534a An object whose array bounds are specified by an
         <implied-shape-or-assumed-size-spec> shall be a dummy data
         object or a named constant."
{The otherwise-ambiguous case.  Note careful wording.}

[96:24-25] 5.3.8.6p1
  Replace sentence
    "An implied-shape array ... <implied-shape-spec-list>."
  with
    "A named constant is declared to be an implied-shape array by an
     <implied-shape-or-assumed-size-spec> or an <implied-shape-spec>."
{Now two ways of declaring implied shape.}

[96:26] R522, append ", [ [ <lower-bound> : ] * ]...".
{This is now the unambiguously implied-shape spec.}

[107:11] 5.4.11p1 "shape" -> "rank".
{In the PARAMETER statement, only require the rank to be specified in
 a prior specification statement.}

NOTES ON THE EDITS:

(1) Since "[ <lower-bound> : ] *" now appears 4 times, it might make
    sense to define a BNF term for it, e.g. <star-bounds>, and use
    that term in those places instead.

(2) The current wording of C533 is slightly defective, as it does not
    clearly prohibit "REAL,DIMENSION(*) :: dummy,nondummy", seeing as
    how that does indeed declare "the array bounds of a dummy data
    object".  C533 should probably be reworded similarly to C534a.

TITLE: Mixed-kind character assignment
KEYWORDS: Mixed kind, character assignment
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

For a processor that supports both ASCII and ISO 10646 UCS-4
character kinds, assuming without loss of generality that
Selected_Char_Kind('ASCII') is equal to 1 and that
Selected_Char_Kind('ISO_10646') is equal to 10646,
consider the following program:

  Module charkinds
    Integer,Parameter :: ascii = 1
    Integer,Parameter :: ucs4 = 10646
  End Module
  Module overload
    Use charkinds
    Interface Assignment(=)
      Module Procedure char_asg
    End Interface
  Contains
    Subroutine char_asg(a,b)
      Character(*,ascii),Intent(Out) :: a
      Character(*,ucs4),Intent(In) :: b
      Do i=1,Min(Len(a),Len(b))
        a(i:i) = Achar(Mod(Iachar(b(i:i))+1,127))
      End Do
      a(i:) = Repeat('*',Len(a)-Len(b))
    End Subroutine
  End Module
  Program test
    Use overload
    Character(10,ascii) x
    x = ucs4_'Hello'
    Print *,'"',x,'"'
  End Program

This program conforms to Fortran 95, which permitted user-defined
assignment between all characters with different kinds.

However, Fortran 2008 provides intrinsic assignment between
ISO 10646 characters and ASCII characters, so user-defined assignment
is not permitted (12.4.3.4.3 and Table 7.8).

Thus there seems to be a contradiction between the Fortran 95
compatibility description in 1.6.3 and 12.4.3.4.3.

Is the program intended to conform to Fortran 2008?
And if it does, does it print
 "Hello     "
(intrinsic assignment)
 "Ifmmp*****"
(user-defined assignment)?

ANSWER:

The program was not intended to conform to the standard.
An edit is provided to remove the contradiction.

{Describe the incompatibility.}

TITLE: Can ALLOCATE with SOURCE= have side-effects in a PURE proc?
KEYWORDS: Allocate, SOURCE=, PURE, side-effects
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

On comp.lang.fortran Ian Harvey brought up a pointer/PURE
question.

Given a type definition like

 type :: int_ptr
    integer, pointer :: i
 end type int_ptr

And a PURE function like

  PURE function FUN (arg)
    type(int_ptr), intent(in) :: arg
    type(int_ptr), allocatable :: tmp
    FUN = 1
    allocate (tmp, source=arg)
    tmp%i = 2
  end function fun

Is FUN standard conforming?

Doesn't the use of source=arg allow the function to modify a global
entity via the tmp%i = ...?  There don't seem to be any constraints on
what arg%i can point to, which means that the assignment to tmp%i can
have side effects.

Note that C1283(1) prevents usage like
    arg%i = 2

ANSWER:

This was not intended to be standard-conforming.
An edit is supplied to remedy this oversight.

QUESTION:

Questions 1-3 use this module:

  Module m200c2
    Integer,Target :: x = 42
  Contains
    Function fx()
      Integer,Pointer :: fx
      fx => x
    End Function
  End Module

Q1. Consider this main program

  Program q1
    Use m200c2
    Call test(x,fx())                  ! The call.
  Contains
    Subroutine test(a,b)
      Integer :: a,b
      a = a*10                         ! The assignment.
      Print *,a,b
    End Subroutine
  End Program

According to Fortran 2003, "fx()" in the CALL statement is an
expression and not a variable, and has the value 42.  It follows
that the assignment "a = a*10" is standard-conforming and does
not affect the value of B.  Therefore this program prints
 420 42

However, according to Fortran 2008, "fx()" in the CALL statement is a
variable, and therefore the assignment does not conform to the
standard because it affects the value of B and so violates 12.5.2.13
item (3) which requires all updates to B to go through the dummy
argument, and therefore the behaviour of the program is unspecified.

This conflicts with the statement in clause 1 that all Fortran 2003
programs remain conforming in Fortran 2008.

Is this program intended to remain standard-conforming?

Q2. Consider this main program

  Program q2
    Use m200c2
    Call test(x,fx())                  ! The call.
  Contains
    Subroutine test(a,b)
      Integer,Target :: a,b
      a = a*10                         ! The assignment.
      Print *,a,b
    End Subroutine
  End Program

According to Fortran 2003, "fx()" in the CALL statement is an
expression and not a variable, and has the value 42.  It follows
that the assignment "a = a*10" is standard-conforming and does
not affect the value of B.  Therefore this program prints
 420 42

However, according to Fortran 2008, "fx()" in the CALL statement is a
variable, and therefore the assignment to A affects the value of B, so
the program will print
 420 420

This apparently conflicts with the statement in clause 1 that Fortran
2008 is an upwards compatible extension to Fortran 2003.

Is this program intended to have altered semantics?

Q3. Consider this main program

  Program q3
    Use m200c2
    Associate(y=>fx())   ! The association.
      x = 0              ! The assignment.
      Print *,x,y
    End Associate
  End Program

This main program apparently conforms to both Fortran 2003 and Fortran
2008, but according to Fortran 2003 "fx()" in the association is an
expression, evaluated on entry to the construct, and therefore Y
becomes associated with the value 42, and therefore the program prints
the values (spacing may differ)

 0 42

whereas according to Fortran 2008 "fx()" in the association is a
variable, and every reference to Y is a reference to the associated
variable, so the assignment also changes the value of Y and therefore
the program prints the values

 0 0

This apparently conflicts with the statement in clause 1 that Fortran
2008 is an upwards compatible extension to Fortran 2003.

Is this program intended to have altered semantics?

Q4. Consider this program

  Module m200c2_q4
    Integer,Target :: x = 42
  Contains
    Function fx()
      Class(*),Pointer :: fx
      fx => x
    End Function
  End Module
  Program q4
    Use m200c2_q4
    Select Type (q=>fx())
    Type Is (Integer)
      x = 0
      Print *,x,q
    End Select
  End Program

Using the same logic as Q2, this should print the values
 0 42
in Fortran 2003, but the values
 0 0
in Fortran 2008.

Again, this is not upwards compatible with Fortran 2003.

Is this program intended to have altered semantics.

A1. This program is not intended to be conforming to Fortran 2008.

[24:17-27] Change all bullet points into separate paragraphs.
{These are no longer a list.}

[24:27+] Insert new paragraph at end of subclause
  "An actual argument that corresponds to a nonpointer dummy argument
   and which is a <function-reference> to a pointer function is
   regarded as a variable by this part of ISO/IEC 1539 but was
   regarded as an expression by Fortran 95; if the target of the
   pointer result is modified other than through that dummy argument
   during execution of the called procedure, the program does not
   conform to this part of ISO/IEC 1539."

[24:30] 1.6.4 "Fortran 90 compatibility", paragraph 1
  Change "Any" to "Except as identified in this subclause, any",

[25:6+] Insert new paragraph at end of subclause.

NUMBER: F08/0090
TITLE: 	What restrictions apply to initialization and PARAMETER?
KEYWORDS: PARAMETER, initialization, conformable, type conversion
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification or Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Consider the programs

  Program m200c3_1
    Integer :: a(10,10)
    Parameter (a = [ (i,i=1,100) ] )
    Print *,a
  End Program

  Program m200c3_2
    Parameter (b = 'ok')
    Print *,b
  End Program

  Program m200c3_3
    Integer :: x(23) = [ 1 ]
    Print *,x
  End Program

  Program m200c3_4
    Integer :: y = 'ok'
    Print *,y
  End Program

The PARAMETER statement for the named constant A has an expression
whose shape does not conform with that of A.  The PARAMETER statement
for the named constant B has an expression whose type does not conform
to that of B.  The <initialization> for X is not conformable in shape.
The <initialization> for Y is not conformable in type.

There appears to be no requirement either for shape or type
conformance, in Fortran 2008 or in previous Fortran standards, except
for initializing data pointers.

Q1. Do any of these programs conform to Fortran 2008?

Q2. If there is meant to be a requirement for the shapes to conform or
    for the types to be convertible, should this not be a constraint?

ANSWER:

A1. No, these programs do not conform to Fortran 2008, as no
    interpretation is established for any of them.  Edits are
    provided to clarify this.

A2. This is not a constraint.  A future revision of Fortran might
    choose to mandate diagnosis of these errors.

EDIT to 10-007r1:

[88:30+] 5.2.1 Syntax, Insert new paragraph at end of subclause
  "If <initialization> appears for a nonpointer entity,
   - its type and type parameters shall conform as specified for
     intrinsic assignment (7.2.1.2);
   - if the entity has implied shape, the rank of <initialization>
     shall be the same as the rank of the entity;
   - if the entity does not have implied shape, <initialization> shall
     either be scalar or have the same shape as the entity.".

[107:12+] 5.4.11 PARAMETER statement, after p2, Insert new paragraph
  "The constant expression that corresponds to a named constant shall
   have type and type parameters that conform with the named constant
   as specified for intrinsic assignment (7.2.1.2).  If the named
   constant has implied shape, the expression shall have the same rank
   as the named constant; otherwise, the expression shall either be
   scalar or have the same rank as the named constant.".
