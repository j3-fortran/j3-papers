INTRODUCTION

This paper is in response to 02-136.  Several things from 02-136
are incorporated; others are expanded on or done differently.
Paper 02-136 addressed unresolved issues 341, 342, 345, 346, and
347, so this paper does also.

The central thrust of this paper is to reorganize some material
relating to interoperability, gathering most of it into clause
15, with references as needed elsewhere.  Currently, the material
is scattered into several places in the document, notably clauses
5 and 12.  Paper 02-136 proposed some such gathering, but this
paper takes it farther.  Issues 341 and 342 are the central ones
here, the others being somewhat peripheral to the reorganization.

In one area, this paper makes the opposite suggestion from paper
02-136.  Although there are arguments for both sides, this paper
favors the term "BIND attribute" instead of "BIND(C) attribute".
Either form has the potential for requiring changes if an
additional language binding is introduced.  Both forms appear in
the existing text; the intention here is to change the "BIND(C)"
forms where used in the context of the name of an attribute.  The
syntax still includes the "(C)".  This is consistent with the
intent expressed in recent J3 meetings.  (The author of this
paper actually prefers the global substitution of LANG instead of
BIND, but leaves that as an independent question not addressed
here.)

EDITS

In c04, Fix BIND(C) types.  John's fix doesn't work because we
aren't talking about data entities here - just type definitions.
But we don't really need to say that anyway because procedure
components are always pointers and so are already covered.  We do
need to rule out intrinsic types that aren't interoperable; the
original words missed that.  Also, refer to "BIND attribute"
where we can.  Finally, I suggest moving the requirements
specific to the BIND attribute to c15, with a reference here.
(An alternative minimal fix is easy if that move is
rejected).

  [41:16] "definition of a derived type specifies BIND(C)" ->
  "derived type has the BIND attribute".

  [53:9-11] "BIND(C)" -> "BIND" twice.

  [42:7-12] Move these constraints to [376:1-] and reword as
  follows.

    "C15xx (R423) A derived type with the BIND attribute shall
     not be a sequence type.

     C15xx (R423) A derived type with the BIND attribute shall
     not have type parameters.

     C15xx (R423) A derived type with the BIND attribute shall
     not have the EXTENSIBLE or EXTENDS attribute.

     C15xx (R423) A <derived-type-def> with the BIND attribute
     shall not have a <type-bound-procedure-part>.

     C15xx (R423) Each component of a derived type with the BIND
     attribute shall be a nonpointer, nonallocatable data component
     with interoperable type and type parameters."

  [45:27+] Insert a new para before the note.
  "Derived types with the BIND attribute are subject to additional
   constraints as specified in 15.2.4."

In c05

  [67:30] "<language-binding-spec>" ->
  "<proc-language-binding-spec>" per 02-136.

  Following 02-136, but using our improved definitions.
  [67:33-34] "a variable" -> "an interoperable variable (15.2)"
  
  [67:32-33] delete "POINTER... The".  It is all covered by the
  preceding edit.

  [73:1-4] Replace heading and para with

    "5.1.2.4 BIND attribute for data entities"

     The BIND attribute for a variable or common block specifies
     that it is interoperable with a C variable with external
     linkage (15.2.7)."

  Delete issue 341 on pg 73. [see also edit for 270:6+]

  Note 5.10 - move note to [73:6+] after C547, which is basically
  what it refers to.

  [73:7-8] Delete sentence "The BIND...(15.2.7)".  It is now
  covered (and better so) by constraints.

  Following John's lead, but using improved definitions,
  [83:3+] Add
    "C558a (R526) If a <bind-entity> is a common block, each
     variable of the common block shall be interoperable (15.2)"

In c12

  Per John,
  250:9,22,25,26. Change <language-binding-spec> to
  <proc-language-binding-spec>.

  250:24. Delete ', <language-binding-spec>'.  (typo)

  [264:19-24] Replace the two constraints and para with
    "C1238 (R1225) A <proc-language-binding-spec> shall not
     be specified for a procedure whose interface is not
     interoperable (15.2.6)."
  (Yes, that covers all that was here, plus the things that
  were omitted from here.  Get it right in one place and then
  reference it instead of duplicating pieces of it incorrectly
  all over the place.)

  264: Delete Note 12.38.  This is a random incomplete
  repetition of the requirements.  Better to look at the
  real ones in 15.2.6.

  [267:1-3] Delete C1249.  The new C1238 covers this and much
  more.  We don't need to incorrectly duplicate it here.  The
  old versions both omitted different parts.

  [269:37-40] Delete the sentence beginning "If...letters".
  Per issue 345 and 02-136, most of this is not needed.

  I almost added a short para at [269:29+] to cover the material
  suggested by issue 345, but I realized that I'm not at all
  sure we really want that and if we did, we missed some cases.
  (Is there any reason to disallow mixture of BIND(C) and
  non-BIND(C) entries in the same subprogram?  Seems to me it
  is a potentially useful thing...assuming, of course, that one
  considers ENTRY useful in the first place.  If we were going
  to disallow it, we only did it in one direction, which seems
  odd.  Lets just force the BIND(C) on an ENTRY to be explicitly
  specified if that's what you want; it doesn't seem like a big
  deal - the potential confusions from making it implicit seem
  bigger.)

  270: Issue 345.  Delete the issue.

  (I'm not yet sure I'm happy with the wording of the following
  edit, but it follows both existing wording and that of 02-136.
  Might fix this better later, but at least need something here
  to substitute for deleting words like this from 5.1.2.4 in
  the process of fixing issue 341).

  [270:6+] Add para

    "The BIND attribute for a procedure specifies that it is
     interoperable with a C function with external linkage."

  [270:7-280:11]  Replace with
  "Interoperation with C functions is described in 15.4."
  (all this material is now in 15.4, with the wording changed,
  hopefully improved.)

Subclause 15.2.3 has little relation to defining interoperability,
which is the subject of 15.2.  It belongs better in 15.1, as it
describes procedures in the module.  We'd like it to be a subclause
under 15.1, so we move much of the existing 15.1 down a level
(there shouldn't be a 15.1.1 without also having a 15.1.2).

  371:19-  Insert section heading
    "15.1.1 Named constants and derived types in the module".

  [372:23] "shall be..use" -> "is".  Part of this was redundant
  and part was false (15.2.2 does not describe the use).

  372:24 Delete line.

  [374:4-]  Insert the following note at the end of 15.2.2.

    "The function C_LOC can be used to return an entity of type
    C_PTR with the C address of a procedure or allocated
    allocatable variable.  The entity of type C_PTR is
    interoperable and thus may be used in contexts where the
    procedure or allocatable variable is not directly allowed.
    For example, it could be passed as an actual argument to a
    C function.

    Similarly, type C_PTR can be used in a dummy argument or
    structure component and can have a value that is the C address
    of a procedure or allocatable variable, even in contexts where
    a procedure or allocatable variable is not directly allowed."

  The following two edits per John.

  374:5. Change first sentence to 'A C procedure argument is
  often defined in terms of a <<C address>>'. [We clearly need the
  term.]

  374:7,9. Change '"C address"' to 'C address'.

  372:26+ Move 15.2.3 (after above 2 edits) to here,
  changing heading to "15.1.2 Procedures in the module"

Simplify long lists of names along lines suggested in 02-136

  [371:13-17] Replace "C_INT...C_BOOL" with "named constants
  with the names listed in the second column of Table 15.1"

  [371:19-2] Replace "C_INT...C_CHAR" with
  "listed in the second column of table 15.1"

  Per John,
  372:2,4. Move 'C_SIGNED_CHAR' up to follow 'C_LONG_LONG'.
  372:16. Move line to follow NOTE 15.2.

Subclause 15.2 is where we define the term interoperability in
all its forms.  Material that does anything other than define
that term doesn't belong here (notably 15.2.3 and 15.2.7).
We also strengthen the organization by clearly separating the
treatment of types from the treatment of data entities.

  372:27 Change "Interoperation" to "Interoperability"

  Be more general here.

  [372:27+]  Insert

  \begin{jnote}
    Need to clarify what it means for something to be just plain
    interoperable (as opposed to interoberable with something in
    particular).
  \end{jnote}

  372:28 "a variable...procedure." -> "a Fortran entity"

  and less wordy

  372:29 "an entity in a C program" -> "a C entity"
  372:29 "entity in the Fortran program" -> "Fortran entity"

  373:1 Change heading to "Interoperability of intrinsic types"

  Move Note 15.4 to [377:2-] at the end of the subclause on
  arrays.  Also insert the xref "Note 15.18" at the beginning
  of the last line of Note 15.4.

  Remove discussion of entities of these types; this is just
  about the types (and type parameters) themselves.

  373:2-11 Replace this para with

    "Table 15.1 shows the interoperability between Fortran intrinsic
    types and C types.  A Fortran intrinsic type with particular
    type parameter values is interoperable with a C type if the
    type and kind type parameter value are listed in the table on
    the same row as that C type and the kind type parameter value
    is positive; if the type is character, interoperability also
    requires that the length type parameter be omitted or be
    specified by an initialization expression whose value is one.
    A combination of Fortran type and type parameters that is
    interoperable with a C type listed in the table is also
    interoperable with any unqualified C type that is compatible
    with the listed C type.

    The second column of the table refers to the named constants
    made accessible by the ISO_C_BINDING intrinsic module.  If
    the value of any of the kind type parameters in the table is
    negative, there is no combination of Fortran type and type parameters
    interoperable with the C type shown in that row."

  Table 15.1 - In title change "Correspondence" -> "Interoperability"

  In note 15.5, "a scalar object of type" -> "the type"
                "a scalar object of the C type" -> "the C type"
                "or of" -> "or"

  In note 15.6, delete "a scalar of"; "scalars of" -> "the".

  Per John
  374:NOTE 15.6, lines 4-5. Change 'C_UNSIGNED_INT,
  ... C_UNSIGNED_CHAR' to 'for their kind type parameter
  values'. [As far as I can see, these names are not defined.]

  [374:1] Change "Interoperation" -> "Interoperability"

  [374:2-3] Replace para with
    "C_PTR shall be a derived type with private components or
    shall be a type alias name.  It is interoperable with any C
    pointer type."

  Note 15.8.  Delete this note.  (It is no longer true).

  [375:18] Change "Interoperation" -> "Interoperability"

  [375:19-20] "A scalar Fortran...C entity of a" ->
  "A Fortran derived type is interoperable with a C"

  [375:22] "are interoperable with" ->
  "have types and type parameters that are interoperable with
   the types of"

  [376:1] "Fortran entity" -> "Fortran type"
          delete "entity of a".

  [376:2:3] "Fortran entity" -> "Fortran type"
          delete "entity of a".

  Note 15.11 First sentence
    "a scalar C object of type" -> "the C type"
    "a scalar Fortran object of type" -> "the Fortran type"

  Note 15.11 Last line
    "entities of a derived type are" -> "a Fortran derived type is"
    "entities of a C" -> "a C"

  Note 15.12 - Delete "entity of" twice.

  [376:4-] Insert new subclause

    "15.2.x Interoperability of scalars"

     A scalar Fortran data entity is interoperable with a scalar C
     entity if their types and type parameters are interoperable,
     the Fortran entity is not polymorphic, and the Fortran entity
     has neither the pointer nor the allocatable attribute.

  [376:4] Change heading to "Interoperability of arrays"

  [377] Add a new note after Note 15.13

     "A polymorphic, allocatable, or pointer array is never
      interoperable.  Such arrays are not explicit shape or
      assumed size."

  [377:2] Change heading to
  "Interoperability of procedure interfaces"

  377: Issue 342 - delete the issue.

  [377:8-9] "compatable with the C type" -> "of"
  (It is claimed that no type other than void meets the previous
  criterion anyway - I wouldn't know).

  We want interoperability of the entities, not just the types.
  This covers the type parameters and excludes polymorphics,
  pointers, and allocatables.  We did talk about entities for
  the VALUE case.
  [378:4] Delete "type of the"
  [378:5] insert "an entity of" after "with"

  Consolidate requirements specified in random other places
  to here.

  [377:6] insert "a scalar that is" before "interoperable".

  [377:12] insert "nonoptional" after "are".

Subclause 15.2.7 does not define interoperability and thus
doesn't belong under 15.2.  It defines linkage of global
variables.  Also, we've already defined what it means for a
variable to be interoperable.  This subclause is about
making things actually interoperate - not just be interoperable.

  [379:1] Raise heading a level to 15.3.

  [379:2-3] swap the last two "with" clauses in the first sentence
  of the subclause (to avoid the parsing ambiguity that clearly
  confused John).
  
  [379:3,9-10] "is interoperable" -> "interoperates" (twice)

  This subclause perhaps could use further work, but this will
  do for now.

  [380:1] Raise heading one level to 15.3.1
  (We shouldn't have a .1 without a .2 in any case, but I'll
  defer that.  Part of general deferred fixups here.)

  [380:11+] Add a new subclause as follows:

    "15.4 Interoperation with C functions

     A procedure with the BIND attribute shall have an interface
     that is interoperable.  The procedure may be defined either

       (1) by means other than Fortran or

       (2) by means of a Fortran subprogram that has a
       <proc-language-binding-spec> in its <function-stmt> or
       <subroutine-stmt>,

     \begin{jnote}
       Work on ENTRY statements is needed.  Do we allow mixing
       BIND(C) and non-BIND(C) procedures in the same subprogram?
       Old words made all entries implicitly BIND(C) if the
       subroutine/function statement was, but did nothing to
       prohibit BIND(C) entries after non-BIND(C) subroutine/function
       statements.  That seems odd.  Current words allow arbitrary
       mixing, which needs a few words added above, but is objected
       to by some.  Another proposal is to prohibit any form of
       mixing and require BIND(C) to be explicit, which would require
       a constraint in the entry statement, and which would probably
       mean the above words are ok.
     \end{jnote}

     but not both.

     If the procedure is defined by means other than Fortran,
     it shall

        (1) be describable by a C prototype that is interoperable
            with the interface,

        (2) have external linkage as defined by 6.2.2 of the C
            standard, and

        (3) have the same binding label as the interface.

    A reference to a procedure that has the BIND attribute and is
    defined by means other than Fortran causes the C function to be
    called as specified in the C standard.

    A reference in C to a procedure that has the BIND attribute,
    has the same binding label, and is defined by means of Fortran,
    causes the Fortran procedure to be invoked."

    Move the para from [271:8-11] to here, after deleting "then"
    from [271:9].

    Move 12.5.2.7 to here as 15.4.1.

Annex C typos

  [457:2,7,42] remove "}" at line end.

Issue 346 (all copied as is from 02-136)

  266:NOTE 12.41. Add to first use statement: ', ONLY: C_INT, C_FLOAT

  371: Delete issue 346

  375:NOTE 15.9. Change the first use statement:
      USE ISO_C_BINDING, ONLY: C_PTR, C_FLOAT, C_ASSOCIATED, C_LOC

  379:Note 15.18, first line.  Fix spelling of "interoperability."

  379:NOTE 15.18. Change the first use statement:
      USE ISO_C_BINDING, ONLY: C_CHAR, C_NULL_CHAR

  [457:34] Change to
    "USE ISO_C_BINDING, ONLY: C_INT, C_FLOAT, C_LOC"
