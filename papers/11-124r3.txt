1. Introduction

For BIND(C) procedures, an assumed-type array that is neither assumed-shape
nor assumed-rank must be passed as a simple void * pointer, i.e. the same
as TYPE(C_PTR).

This means that the array element size or indeed any other information
about its type will not be directly available.  Without this information an
assumed-shape dope vector, or array pointer dope vector, or C descriptor
cannot be constructed.

As a consequence, there would be no functional difference between TYPE(*)
explicit-shape and TYPE(*) assumed-size.  Therefore, to avoid user
confusion, TYPE(*) explicit-shape will not be permitted.

Also, the TR provides little guidance as to what the contents of the type
field of the C descriptor should contain in various cases.  Review of these
shows that there is little functionality in distinguishing between unknown
types that are interoperable, and types that are not interoperable: in both
cases, the type is unknown.  Therefore this will be simplified to have a
single value to indicate an unknown type.


2. Discussion

2.1p2 is problematic, since it implies that CLASS(*) is assumed-type.
It is also very strange to read that an assumed-type object "is" something
followed by a constraint that it "shall be" something.
An edit is provided.

Review of 2.1p3 showed that it was much too restrictive, disallowing
TYPE(*) entities from appearing in type declaration statements etc..
(Are these meant to be only implicitly typed?)

3. Edits to N1838

[3:10-12] 2.1p2, replace the whole paragraph with
  "An entity declared with a <declaration-type-spec> of TYPE (*) is an
   assumed-type entity.  It has no declared type and its dynamic type and
   type parameters are assumed from its effective argument."

[3:14] C407x1, after "attribute"
       insert "and is not an explicit-shape array".

[3:15] 2.1p3, after "An assumed-type variable shall"
       replace "appear ... with"
       with "not appear in a designator or expression except as an
             actual argument corresponding to".
{It is only its appearance in/as a designator/expression that is
 problematic.}

[3:18+] Insert explanatory note
  "NOTE 2.1
   An assumed-type object that is not assumed-shape and not assumed-rank
   is passed as a simple pointer to the first address of the object.
   This means that there is insufficient information to construct an
   assumed-shape dope vector or C descriptor.
   As a consequence, there would be no functional difference between
   TYPE(*) explicit-shape and TYPE(*) assumed-size.
   Therefore TYPE(*) explicit-shape is not permitted."

[5:6] "is also required to" -> "shall".
{Remove repetitive redundancy, use correct ISO language.}

[12:Table 5.2] Delete entry for CFI_type_struct.

[13:Table 5.2] Replace entry for CFI_type_unspecified with
  "CFI_type_other | Any other type".
{"None of the above" would also work.}

[17:14] 5.2.8p5, at the end before the final full stop, insert
  "; the type member shall have a value from Table 5.2 that depends on the
   effective argument as follows:
   (-) if the dynamic type of the effective argument is an interoperable
       type listed in Table 5.2, the corresponding value for that type;
   (-) otherwise, CFI_type_other.".
{Bullet list.}
