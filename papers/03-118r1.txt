Subject: Edits for UK comment TC10 (Allocatable array assignment)
Date: 26th February 2003

Comment TC10 of the UK vote was:

    Treat the assignment to an allocatable array in the same way as to
    an allocatable array component

    Allocatable array assignment should be user-friendly the same way that
    allocatable component assignment is; that is, the destination array
    should be reallocated to the correct shape if it is of the incorrect
    shape. Thus, instead of having to say:
       DEALLOCATE (A)
       ALLOCATE (A(SIZE(COMPRESS(B))))
       A = COMPRESS(B)
    one should be able to say
       A = COMPRESS(B)
    and have the same effect (except that if A has the TARGET attribute
    and is already the same size as COMPRESS(B), it should be reused rather
    than go through the allocate-deallocate cycle - for compatibility with
    F90/95).

For consistency, the above should apply to allocatable scalars (with
deferred type parameters) as well as to allocatable arrays.  I.e.

    Treat the assignment to an allocatable variable in the same way as
    to an allocatable component.

    Allocatable variable assignment should be user-friendly the same way that
    allocatable component assignment is; that is, a destination array
    should be reallocated to the correct shape if it is of the incorrect
    shape, and if the destination has deferred type parameters, it
    should be reallocated to have the correct values.

    A scalar example is that for
      CHARACTER(:),ALLOCATABLE :: A,B
    instead of
      DEALLOCATE(A)
      ALLOCATE(CHARACTER(LEN(B))::A)
      A = B
    one should be able to say
      A = B
     and have the same effect.


Here are the edits for this:

32:25. Change "a derived-type" to "an".
{Deferred type parameters will now be able to change even for intrinsic
assignment statements.}

32:25. Change reference 7.4.1.2 to 7.4.1.3
{Because 7.4.1.3 is where this is described.
 NOTE: This edit should be done even if the rest of the paper is not.}

139:7. Replace the line by

   (2) Either <variable> shall be an allocatable array of the same rank
       as <expr> or the shapes of <variable> and <expr> shall conform,
       and

139:9+7. Last line of Table 7.8. Add "kind" before "type parameters".
   and after "<variable>" add
   "; each nonkind type parameter value shall be the same unless
   <variable> is allocatable and the corresponding type parameter
   is deferred"
{NOTE: "nonkind" should probably be "length" or whatever else is decided.}

139:28+. Add paragraph and note
  "If <variable> is an allocated allocatable variable, it is deallocated
   if <expr> is an array of different shape or any of the corresponding
   nonkind type parameter values of <variable> and <expr> differ. If
   <variable> is or becomes an unallocated allocatable variable, it is
   allocated with the dynamic type and type parameters of <expr>, the
   shape of <expr>, and with each lower bound (if any) equal to the
   corresponding element of LBOUND(<expr>).

   Note 7.34a
   For example, given the declaration
     CHARACTER(:),ALLOCATABLE :: NAME
   then after the assignment statement
     NAME = 'Dr. '//FIRST_NAME//' '//SURNAME
   NAME will have the length LEN(FIRST_NAME)+LEN(SURNAME)+5, even if it
   had previously been unallocated, or allocated with a different length.
   However, for the assignment statement
     NAME(:) = 'Dr. '//FIRST_NAME//' '//SURNAME
   NAME must already be allocated at the time of the assignment; the
   assigned value is truncated or blank padded to the previously
   allocated length of NAME."

140:4+4+. Append to note 7.36
  "If C is an allocatable array of rank 1, then
     C = PACK(ARRAY,ARRAY>0)
   will cause C to contain all the positive elements of ARRAY in array element
   order; if C is not allocated or is allocated with the wrong size, it will
   be re-allocated to be of the correct size to hold the result of PACK."
