From: Malcolm Cohen
Subject: Interoperable enum types, additional specs/syntax/edits
Date: 2021-October-18
Reference: 21-110r1, 21-121


1. Introduction

An entity of interoperable enum type is not permitted as an argument to the
INT intrinsic. The specs/syntax paper 21-110r1 clearly intended this to be
allowed, but this is not explicitly stated.

Secondly, there is no clear statement as to the set of values of an
interoperable enum type, which could lead to confusion.

Thirdly, interoperable enum types are not currently permitted in relational
expressions. That would also appear to be an oversight.

Fourthly, interoperable enum types are not currently permitted in SELECT
CASE constructs. If we allow them in relationals, we should allow them here
as well.

This paper adds new specifications/syntax, and has edits.


2. Additional specifications

(K) The INT intrinsic can be used to convert enum type to integer,
    basically returning the value with the same internal representation.

(L) Interoperable enum types can appear in relational expressions; like
    assignment, only with the same enum type or an expression that has one
    of its enumerators as a primary.

(M) Interoperable enum types can appear in SELECT CASE selectors and CASE
    statements. If the selector is an enum, a CASE expression may be of
    type integer as long as a primary is an enumerator.


3. Additional syntax

The additional syntax follows directly from the specs.


4. Edits for 21-007r2

[89:1] Same subclause, p3
             (beginning "If enum-type-name..."), append sentences:
   "The set of values of an interoperable enum type is homomorphic to the
    set of possible values for the integer kind of its enumerators. The
    internal representation of each enum type value is the same as that of
    the corresponding integer."
{Specify what the values are. Weasel-wording so that on a machine that is
 not two's complement, we don't get two values for zero. This gives us the
 self-explanatory term "corresponding integer value", which we will use to
 describe the semantics when needed.}

[156:6] 10.1.5.1 Intrinsic operation classification, p1,
        "of an intrinsic type" -> "of a type".
{Future-proof: This change is not needed, but improves the text anyway.}

[156:9] Same subclause, p2,
        "of the intrinsic or enumeration types" -> "of the types".
{Currently missing enum types. The types are stringently limited in the
 table, so it serves no purpose to limit them in the prose as well.}

[156:23] 10.1.5.1 Intrinsic operation classification, p6,
         After "same enumeration type." insert new sentence
   "An enum relational intrinsic operation is a relational intrinsic
    operation for which one operand is of an interoperable enum type, and
    the other operand has the same type or is an integer expression
    involving an enumerator of that type."
{Add a new class of intrinsic relation. I gave it a short name by omitting
 the word "interoperable".}

[156:26+8] Same subclause, Table 10.2,
    ".EQ., ..." section,
        Change line "I   I,R,Z     L,L,L"
        to          "I   I,R,Z,En  L,L,L,L"
[156:26+12+]
        After line "E   E   L"
        insert line "En   En,I   L,L"
[156:26+13]
    ".GT., ..." section,
        Change line "I   I,R     L,L"
        to          "I   I,R,En  L,L,L"
[157:0+3]
        After line "E   E   L"
        insert line "En   En,I   L,L"
[157:0+8]
    Footnote section of table,
        After "both operands." insert new sentence
  "The symbol En stands for an enum type, where if the other operand is En,
   they have the same type, and if the other operand is I, the integer
   operand is an expression with a primary that is an enumerator of the
   enum type."
{Insert into table. Declarative form "is" rather than "shall be" as these
 are a statement of what the intrinsic relationals are, we don't phrase the
 others as "shall" either.}

ALTERNATIVE 1:
Same edits as above except for the footnote section, insert instead
  "The symbol En stands for an enum type; the other operand shall conform
   as specified in Table 10.8."
{Refer to Table 10.8, which is about assignment, instead of duplicating the
 requirement. It seems a little odd to refer to an assignment table for
 intrinsic operations, but we do that for array constructor values, so...?}

ALTERNATIVE 2:
Instead of all of the above edits.
[157:0+8-9] Same subclause, Table 10.2,
            after "for both operands"
            insert ", same enum type for both operands, or enum type for
                    one operand with the other in type conformance as
                    specified in Table 10.8",
            making that whole sentence read:
   "The symbol E stands for the same enumeration type for both operands,
    the same enum type for both operands, or enum type for one operand with
    the other in type conformance as specified in Table 10.8."
{This is a lot simpler, but absorbs the integer operands when the other is
 enum into E instead of I. Maybe that's not too confusing?}

[162:15+] 10.1.5.5.1 Interpretation of relational intrinsic operations,
          after p9 "An enumeration relational..." insert new paragraph
  "An enum relational intrinsic operation is interpreted as if all operands
   of enum type are converted to their corresponding integer values."
{Semantics.}

[201:9]. 11.1.9.1 Purpose and form of the SELECT CASE construct,
         C1148 "case-expr shall be of type",
         before "enumeration type" insert "enum or",
         making the whole constraint read
   "C1148 case-expr shall be of type character, integer, or logical, or of
          enum or enumeration type."
{Permit enum types in SELECT CASE selectors.}
ALTERNATIVE
[201:9] Replace constraint with
   "C1148 case-expr shall be of character, integer, logical, enum, or
          enumeration type."
{We nearly always put "type" before intrinsic types, but that doesn't work
 for derived/enum/enumeration where it has to come after. Breaking our
 "type before intrinsic" convention simplifies the sentence.}

[201:18] 11.1.9.1 Purpose and form of the SELECT CASE construct,
         C1150 "(R1142) For a given case-construct ...", sentence 1,
         after "case-expr"
         insert ", or in type conformance as specified in Table 10.8 if
                 case-expr is of an enum type",
         making that sentence (not the whole constraint) read
   "For a given case-construct, each case-value shall be of the same type
    as case-expr, or in type conformance as specified in Table 10.8 if
    case-expr is of an enum type."
{Permit enum types and compatible integer expressions in CASE statements.
 Reusing table 10.8 here is simpler than spelling it out.}

[201:28} 11.1.9.2 Execution of a SELECT CASE construct, para 1, item (1),
         "type integer or character" -> "other types",
         making that item read
   "(1) If the case value range contains a single value v without a colon,
        a match occurs for type logical if the expression c .EQV. v is
        true, and a match occurs for other types if the expression c == v
        is true."
{Specify semantics for the only case for which that is needed.}

[402:35] 16.9.110 INT (A [, KIND]), p3 Argument, A,
         before "enumeration" insert "enum or",
         making that argument read
   "A shall be of type integer, real, complex, or enum or enumeration type,
      or a boz-literal-constant."
{Permit enum type as argument to INT.}
ALTERNATIVE
   "A shall be of integer, real, complex, enum, or enumeration type, or a
    boz-literal-constant."

[403:4+] 16.9.110 INT (A [, KIND]), p5 Result Value,
         after Case (iii) "If A is of type complex..."
         insert new Case
   "Case (iii+1) If A is of enum type, INT (A) has the value of the
                 corresponding integer value."
{Specify semantics of INT on enum type.}
