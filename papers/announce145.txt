Subject:  Meeting 145 and Indianapolis 500 Race Announcements


J3 Meeting 145 is scheduled for May 25 - 29 at the Drury Inn in
Terre Haute, Indiana.  Potential attendees should be making arrangements
for transportation and housing.  The contract deadline for making
reservations at the Hotel is May 9, 1998.  Reservations should be
secured by credit card.  The keyword to use when making reservations
is J3.  The rates of $89.00 on May 23 (because of the Indianapolis 500
race on May 24) and $66.95 on May 24 - 30 (plus 7% tax) are for single
or double occupancy.  Most rooms have two double beds, but some have a
king-size bed.

Note that individual reservations may be cancelled up to 6:00 p.m.
on the day of arrival without penalty.  Also, note that the cost of
the meeting room provided by the hotel is included in the individual
room rentals and J3 will not incur an additional meeting room rental fee.

The hotel does not operate a complimentary airport shuttle.  The only
airline serving Terre Haute's Hulman Field is United Express via Chicago.
There are 3 flights per day (except only two on Saturday) between Chicago 
and Terre Haute.  Flights leave Chicago at 12:26 p.m., 4:35 p.m., and
9:30 p.m., arriving in Terre Haute at 1:47 p.m., 5:56 p.m., and 9;30 p.m.,
respectively.  Flights leave Terre Haute at 5:15 a.m., 2:02 p.m., and
6:17 p.m., arriving in Chicago at 6:42 a.m., 3:29 p.m., and 7:44 p.m.,
respectively.  Ground transportation between Hulman Field and the Drury
Inn (about 5 miles) is by taxi.

Terre Haute can also be reached by flying to the Indianapolis Interna-
tional Airport which is served by many airlines (Northwest, Delta,
American, United, US Air, and others) and taking a rental car or a bus
to Terre Haute.  The distance is about 65 - 70 miles and takes typically
about 90 minutes.

Turner Coaches operates a regular bus/van schedule between the Indianap-
lis Airport and their terminal at 2135 East Margaret Street in Terre
Haute.  Buses/Vans leave the Ground Transportation Center on the lower
level of the parking garage of the airport at 6:25 a.m., 10:25 a.m.,
2:25 p.m., 6:25 p.m., and 10:25 p.m. each day.  Buses/vans leave the
Terre Haute terminal bound for the Indianapolis Airport each day at
4:25 a.m., 8:25 a.m., 12:25 p.m., 4:25 p.m., and 8:25 p.m.  The cost of
a one-way trip is $22.00, and a round-trip ticket is $38.00.  Passengers
may pay the driver at the time of embarkation, but reservations must be
made in advance by calling Turner Coaches at 1-800-873-5252.  Ground
transportation between the Terre Haute terminal at 2135 East Margaret
Street and the Drury Inn (about 18 blocks) is by taxi, and can be
arranged through Turner Coaches.

For those who prefer to fly to Indianapolis and rent a car, the directions
are as follows.  Exit the Airport on I-465 South.  Proceed about 1 mile
South to the intersection of I-70.  Go West on I-70 to Terre Haute (about
65 - 70 miles).  Exit I-70 at the second Terre Haute exit at Third Street
(U.S. 41) going North (right).  The Drury Inn hotel is the second build-
ing from the exit, right after the Pear Tree Inn, with an entrance from
Third Street or Margaret Street.

The Drury Inn is in the heart of Terre Haute's main shopping area on South
Third Street, and is approximately 2 - 3 miles South of the downtown area.
There are several motels, restaurants and shopping centers within walking
distance of the hotel.  However, Third Street (U.S. 41) is a high traffic
four-lane road.  Crossing it on foot, even at intersections requires some
care and quick mobility.

Anyone interested in attending the Indianapolis 500 race on May 24
should express their intent to buy one or more tickets to the host,
Mallory North, via telephone or email as soon as possible.  Ticket
prices are expected to be in the $65.00 - $75.00 price range.
Payment for the tickets is not required now, but when the tickets are
received by the purchaser.  However, reservations for tickets should
be made immediately.  Those who plan to arrive on May 23 to attend the
Indianapolis 500 race on May 24 should make their airline and hotel
reservations as soon as possible.
