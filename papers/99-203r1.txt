Subject: Unresolved issues 178-201 (initial and final)

1. Introduction

This paper returns the initial/final status essentially to that of 99-007,
i.e. it removes the facility entirely.  A later paper will add the more
manageable subset that is still required by WG5.

2. Overview of edits

Delete the <binding-id> syntax (R442).

Delete section 4.5.1.5.1 (Initial procedures).

Delete section 4.5.1.5.2 (Final procedures).

Delete section 4.5.6.1 (Intrinsic structure constructors),
re-inserting original text.

Delete section 4.5.6.2 (Defined structure constructors).

Delete section 6.3 (Initialization and Finalization).

Delete back-references throughout the document to 6.3, reinstating the
previous text they replaced (in particular, in 6.4.1.2, 6.4.3.1, 6.4.3.2).

Return 14.7.5 (Events that cause variables to become defined) and
14.7.6 (Events that cause variables to become undefined) to their
previous state.

3. Edits

The edits are based on reversing the effect of paper 99-108r1, with page
and line number references updated from 99-007 to 99-007r2.

[44:12] Change "<binding-id>" to "<binding-name>".
[44:20] Delete.
[44:28-30] Delete.

[46:36] Change "has <<default initialization>> (6.3)" to
        "is initially defined (14.7.3) or becomes defined as specified in
         (14.7.5)"

[46:37] After "definition." insert
        "The evaluation rules are those that would be in effect for intrinsic
        assignment (7.5.1.4) if <component-name> were a variable assigned the
        value of <initialization-expr>.  If <component-name> is of a type for
        which default initialization is specified for a component, the default
        initialization specified by <initialization-expr> overrides the default
        initialization specified for that component.  When one initialization
        <<overrides>> another it is as if only the overriding initialization
        were specified (see Note 4.24).  Explicit initialization in a type
        declaration statement (5.1) overrides default initialization (see Note
        4.23)."

[49:13-15] Delete.

[49:36-52:3] Delete sections 4.5.1.5.1 and 4.5.1.5.2.
             This deletes issue 192.

[59:9-11] Delete "A structure constructor is ... one initial procedure."
{The first sentence is not returned to its 99-007 form because that was
 incorrect - it had not been updated to handle the possible omission of
 values (for components that have default initialization).}

[60:1-61:3] Delete.
            This deletes the section heading 4.5.6.1 (though almost all of
            the text remains), syntax rule R451 and issue 193.

[61:4] Change "intrinsic-structure-constructor" to "structure-constructor".

[63:7-24] Delete section 4.5.6.2.
          This deletes issue 194.

[77:10] Change "undergoes the initialization process (6.3)" to
        "becomes undefined except for components of an object of derived type
         for which default initialization has been specified".

[78:17-18] Replace last sentence of paragraph with
           "Because an INTENT(OUT) variable is considered undefined on entry
            to the procedure, any default initialization specified for its
            type will be applied."

[81:18-36] Replace first two paragraphs of section with text from 99-007, viz
           "An object with the SAVE attribute, declared in the scoping unit of
            a subprogram, retains its association status, allocation status,
            definition status, and value after execution of a RETURN or END
            statement unless the object is a pointer and its target becomes
            undefined (14.6.2.1.3(3)).  The object is shared by all instances
            (12.5.2.3) of the subprogram.  Such an object is called a saved
            object.

            An object with the SAVE attribute, declared in the scoping unit of
            a module, retains its association status, allocation status,
            definition status, and value after a RETURN or END statement is
            executed in a procedure that accesses the module unless the object
            is a pointer and its target becomes undefined."

[86:14-23] Replace "its common ... also contains that common block" with
           the text from 99-007 (but with the cross-reference fixed), viz
           "the values in the common block storage sequence (5.5.2.1) at the
            time a RETURN or END statement is executed are made available to
            the next scoping unit in the execution sequence of the program that
            specifies the common block name or accesses the common block".

[97:11-14] Delete note.]

[109:1-120:19] Delete section 6.3 and renumber remaining sections.
               This deletes issues 178,179,180,181,182,183,184,185,186,187,
               188,189 and 190.


[122:28-45] Replace with text from 99-007 [107:28-43], modified to cope with
            allocatable scalars (not just arrays):
            "An allocatable object with the SAVE attribute has an initial
             status of not currently allocated.  If the object is allocated,
             its status changes to currently allocated.  The status remains
             currently allocated until the object is deallocated.

             An allocatable object that is a dummy argument of a procedure
             receives the allocation status of the actual argument with which
             it is associated on entry to the procedure.  An allocatable object
             that is a subobject of a dummy argument of a procedure receives
             the allocation status of the corresponding component of the actual
             argument on entry to the procedure.

             An allocatable object that does not have the SAVE attribute, that
             is a local variable of a procedure or a subobject thereof, that is
             not a dummy argument or a subobject thereof, and that is not
             accessed by use or host association, has a status of not currently
             allocated at the beginning of each invocation of the procedure.
             The status may change during execution of the procedure.  If the
             object is not the result variable of the procedure or a subobject
             thereof and has a status of currently allocated when the procedure
             is exited by execution of a RETURN or END statement, it is
             deallocated.

             Unresolved issue 7

             This information is repeated in 6.4.3.1, but the 2 versions don't
             quite agree, as 6.4.3.1 also adds an exclusion for dummy args.  I
             wonder whether we really need to say the same thing 2 different
             times anyway.

             An allocatable object that does not have the SAVE attribute and
             that is accessed by use association has an initial status of not
             currently allocated.  The status may change during execution of
             the program.  If the object has an allocation status of currently
             allocated when execution of a RETURN or END statement results in
             no scoping unit having access to the module, it is processor
             dependent whether the allocation status remains currently
             allocated or the array is deallocated."

[123:2-5] Delete "The effect of ... (6.3.3).".

[125:17+] Reinstate text from [99-007:110:1-20], modified to cope with
          allocatable scalars, not just allocatable arrays; and to handle
	  INTENT(OUT) correctly.

          "When the execution of a procedure is terminated by execution of a
           RETURN or END statement, an allocatable variable that is a local
           variable of the procedure retains its allocation and definition
           status if

           (1)	It has the SAVE attribute,   

           (2)	It is a dummy argument or a subobject thereof,  

           (3)	It is a function result variable or a subobject thereof,  

           (4)	It is accessed by use association, if the module defining the
                array is also accessed by another scoping unit that is
                currently in execution, or

           (5)	It is accessed by host association.  

           When the execution of a procedure is terminated by execution of a
           RETURN or END statement, an allocated allocatable variable that is a
           local variable of the procedure and is not included in the above
           categories has allocation status as follows:

           (1)	If it is accessed by use association, its allocation status is
                processor dependent.

           (2)	Otherwise, it is deallocated (as if by a DEALLOCATE statement).


           If a statement references a function whose result is allocatable or
           a structure with a subobject that is allocatable, and the function
           reference is executed, an allocatable result and any subobjects that
           are allocated allocatable entities in the result returned by the
           function are deallocated after execution of the statement.

	   When a procedure is invoked, a currently allocated allocatable
	   object that is an actual argument or a subobject of an actual
	   argument associated with an INTENT(OUT) allocatable dummy argument
	   is deallocated.

           When a variable of derived type is deallocated, any ultimate
           component that is allocatable and currently allocated is deallocated
           (as if by a DEALLOCATE statement).".

[125:20-22] Delete "Processor merging ... is terminated."

          declared or accessed in the subprogram that defines the procedure
          becomes undefined unless it is one of the following:

          (1)	A pointer with the SAVE attribute, 

          (2)	A pointer in blank common, 

          (3)	A pointer in a named common block that appears in at least one
