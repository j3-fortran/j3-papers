Prepraired by Deepak Enchempati, the HPE rep to OpenMP.

OpenMP 6.0 was released during SC24. An updated OpenMP Examples
document with some OpenMP 6.0 examples was also released. OpenMP 6.1
is planned to be released during SC'26. A face-to-face meeting was
held in January (hosted by NERSC) to discuss various updates for
6.1. The major topics discussed included:

- Various extensions for improved mapping of OpenMP target offload
  regions to GPUs. This includes extensions for dynamic groupprivate
  memory that is accessible in a target region, multi-dimensional
  grids, and better support for declaring reusable kernel entry
  points.

- Clarifications on how data-mapping should work for Fortran objects
  with polymorphic types.

- Support non-commutative reductions for various loop-associated
  constructs, where results are to be combined into the original
  variable in iteration order.

- Extensions for expressing thread-to-device affinity.

- Extension to loop fusion construct so that it may be apply to
  multi-dimensional loop nests.

- Support for fission loop-transforming construct.

- A directive for declaring default clause-sets that should be applied
  to directives.
