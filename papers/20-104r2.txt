1. Introduction
This paper replaces 19-181. 19-244. 

2. Question 
16.6 par. 7 contains this statement pertaining to the execution of a 
collective subroutine:
"If the STAT argument is present and ... the current team contained
failed images, an error condition occurs and the value 
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE from the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV is
assigned to the STAT argument".
Given that an image might fail during the execution of the collective
subroutine, what exactly does this require of the implementation and 
is it deliverable? 

3. Response
This statement is stronger than was intended. A collective subroutine 
is defined (3.143.2) as an "intrinsic subroutine that performs a 
calculation on a team of images without requiring synchronization".
For performance reasons, it was intended that once an image has 
completed its calculation it should be free to execute other statements
without waiting for the other images to do so. 16.7 para. 7 seems to 
require that a synchronization of all images of the team should occur
before any are freed in order to ensure that none have failed. This 
was not intended and an edit is provided to correct this. A similar
issue applies to stopped images.

4. Edits to 18-007r1

[331:28] In 16.6 Collective subroutines, para 5, 
    insert
        " on an image," after "collective subroutine"
    change
        ", it" 
    to
        ", the STAT argument"
        

    so that the sentence becomes
         "If the STAT argument is present in a reference to a collective 
          subroutine on an image, and its execution is successful, the 
          STAT argument is assigned the value zero."
        
[331:30] In 16.6 Collective subroutines, para 6, 
    change
        "occurs"
    to
        "is known to have occurred at the completion of the reference"
    delete
        "it is assigned a positive value and"

    so that the sentence becomes
        "If the STAT argument is present in a reference to a collective 
         subroutine and an error condition is known to have occurred 
         at the completion of the reference, the A argument becomes 
         undefined."

[331:32] In 16.6 Collective subroutines, para 7, sentence 1, change
        "current team contains stopped images"
    to
        "current team contains images known to have stopped".

    so that the sentence becomes
        "If the STAT argument is present and the current team contains
         images known to have stopped, an error condition occurs and
         the value STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE from the intrinsic module 
         ISO_FORTRAN_ENV is assigned to the STAT argument."

[331:34] In 16.6 Collective subroutines, para 7, sentence 2, change
        "if the current team contained failed images"
    to
        "if the current team contains images known to have failed".

    so that the sentence becomes
        "Otherwise, if the current team contains images known to 
         have failed, an error condition occurs and the value 
         STAT_FAILED_IMAGE from the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
         is assigned to the STAT argument."

[516:7+] In 19.6.6 Events that cause variables to become undefined, add
(28+) "If the STAT argument is present in a reference to a collective 
      subroutine and an error condition is known to have occurred at 
      the completion of the reference, the A argument becomes undefined."
