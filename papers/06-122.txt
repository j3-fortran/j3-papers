Begin Preface
=============

This paper represents a draft of the edits for feature uk-001, co-arrays. 

The major changes with respect to 05-272r2 are:

1) The following replacements of intrinsics by statements has been made:
   FLUSH_MEMORY by SYNC_MEMORY, SYNC_ALL by SYNC_ALL, SYNC_TEAM by 
   SYNC_IMAGES; NOTIFY_TEAM by NOTIFY; READY_TEAM by QUERY, and  
   WAIT_TEAM by QUERY. The main reason is that they 
   affect the flow of control between images. (Recall that the FLUSH 
   statement in 2003 started out as a subroutine, but was changed to a 
   statement during integration.) The descriptions are more self-contained 
   and the change allows dynamic restrictions to be imposed to avoid race 
   conditions. A QUERY statement is called 'blocking' if it has no READY= 
   specifier or if it has a READY= specifier whose value is .true. .

2) To allow for efficient use of barrier hardware on systems that have it, 
   we have made SYNC_ALL separate from SYNC_IMAGES in the sense that all
   images are delayed until they have all executed SYNC_ALL an equal number 
   of times.

3) NOTIFY and QUERY are allowed to have a scalar image set.

4) A blocking QUERY requires the number of NOTIFY executions for its image M
   on each image T of its image set to be at least one greater than the 
   number of blocking QUERY executions for T on M. 

5) There is no equivalent to SYNC_TEAM(TEAM,WAIT), but it can be written as
   a NOTIFY/QUERY pair. 

6) The following is not a technical change but it is a major clarification
   of the description. Any of the statements SYNC_ALL, SYNC_IMAGES, 
   SYNC_MEMORY, NOTIFY, QUERY, 
   ALLOCATE, DEALLOCATE, CRITICAL, END CRITICAL, OPEN, CLOSE, BACKSPACE, 
   ENDFILE, REWIND, END or RETURN may affect the execution ordering between
   images and are called 'image control' statements. On an image, the 
   sequence of statements executed between the execution of two image control 
   statements (or before the first image control statement or after the last
   image control statement) is a 'segment'. The processor may optimize the 
   execution of a segment as if it were the only image in execution.   

7) The execution ordering between images may also be affected by 
   'user-defined ordering constructs', usually spin loops. 

8) The following is a major clarification, associated with 6). 
   If a non-volatile co-array variable is defined on an image in a segment,
   it must not be referenced or defined in a segment on another image unless 
   the set of image control statements and user-defined ordering constructs 
   on all the images ensure that one segment is always executed before the 
   other. 
   
9) The collective functions have been changed to subroutines because they 
   involve image synchronization and this is very awkward to define precisely 
   within a statement that involves collective function calls. A call to a 
   collective subroutine is another image control statement.  

10) If the ARRAY or MASK argument of one of the collective subroutines has
   zero size, the result has zero size. Specifications of the result values 
   in this case have been removed.
   
11) For consistency with the OPEN statement, we now require 
   all images of the connect team to execute the same CLOSE, BACKSPACE,
   ENDFILE, or REWIND statement. 

The major changes that were made between J3/05-208 and 05-272r2 were:

1) Instead of overloading the array reduction functions with 
   collective versions, new functions called CO_ALL, etc. were added.
   This is because the overloaded functions would no longer be pure.
   The new functions have an optional argument TEAM, whose absence 
   indicates that the team consists of all the images. We 
   introduced a new category of intrinsic function: collective function. 

2) For consistency with the ALLOCATE statement, we now require 
   all images of the connect team to execute the same OPEN statement. 

3) We added CO_MAXLOC and CO_MINLOC, which we believe were 
   omitted in error in Delft.

EDITS

.......................................................................
[xiii] Introduction, the list of new Fortran 2008 features should 
include

  Parallel programming support: SPMD parallel programming, co-arrays
  for data exchange between images, image control statements, and 
  collective procedures.

.......................................................................
In section 1.6 Compatibility, retain paragraph 3:5-9 regarding new 
intrinsic procedure names. There are new intrinsics introduced in 
this proposal. There are no other compatibility issues introduced in
the proposal.

.......................................................................
[1:18+] Add new section after 1.2

1.2a Images

A Fortran program executes as if it were replicated a number of 
times (which may be one), the number of replications remaining fixed
during execution of the program and available from the intrinsic 
function NUM_IMAGES().  

Each copy is called an <<image>> and has its own set of data objects.
The images execute asynchronously. The programmer controls the 
progress of execution in each image through explicit use of Fortran 
control constructs. The image control statements (8.5) affect
the relative progress of execution between images. Co-arrays provide a 
mechanism for accessing data on one image from another image.

Each image is indexed by an <<image index>>. These form a sequence 
of integers running from one to NUM_IMAGES(). The programmer may 
retrieve the index of the invoking image from the intrinsic 
function THIS_IMAGE().

NOTE 1.0. 
A particular implementation may permit the number of images to 
be chosen at compile time, at link time, or at execute time. The 
number of images may be the same as the number of physical 
processors, or it may be more, or it may be less. 
[end NOTE]
 
NOTE 1.0a.  
It is usual for the program to be written for any number
of images and the actual number for a specific run to be specified
when the program is executed. This allows the program to be developed
with fewer images than will be used in the eventual production runs.
If the system is a uniprocessor, the processor knows that the number
of images is 1 and can take advantage of this. Thus the early testing
of the program can be performed on a uniprocessor.  For compilation
for a multiprocessor, the vendor could supply a switch to specify that
the number of images is 1, which would permit the optimizer to
eliminate overhead associated with parallel execution.  
[end NOTE]

A <<team>> of images is a set of images that are collaborating in a 
computation. The members of the team are specified by a rank-one 
integer array that holds the image indices, with no duplications.

.......................................................................
[11:1-] Add to R213

      <<or>> <critical-construct>

.......................................................................
[11: 23+, 27+, 31+] In the list of action statements, R214, add:

      <<or>> <notify-stmt>
      <<or>> <query-stmt>
      <<or>> <sync-all-stmt>
      <<or>> <sync-images-stmt>
      <<or>> <sync-memory-stmt>
      
.......................................................................
[15:19+] After the second paragraph of 2.3.4 Execution sequence, add

Coordination of the execution sequences of different images is
discussed in 8.5.

.......................................................................
[15:20] Replace the first sentence of the last paragraph of 2.3.4 by

Normal termination of execution of the program occurs on all images 
if a STOP statement or <end-program-stmt> is executed on an image.

.......................................................................
[15:25+] Add at the end of 2.3.4

NOTE 2.2a 
If synchronization is required before all images complete execution, a
SYNC_ALL statement (8.5.1) should be employed ahead of the STOP statement or 
<end-program-stmt>.
[end NOTE]

.......................................................................
[18:20+] Add new subsection to 2.4.5

2.4.5a Co-array

A <<co-array>> is a data entity declared with a <co-array-spec> in 
square brackets. Within an image, it is normally accessed without use 
of co-subscripts in square brackets and its properties are exactly 
those that it would have had without the <co-array-spec> except that 
its value may be referenced or defined by other images. For example, 
the rank, bounds, extents, size, and shape are given by the data in 
parentheses in its declaration or allocation. 

The part of a co-array stored in the memory of a specified image may
be addressed by using <<co-subscripts>> in square brackets. Each
co-subscript shall be a scalar integer expression.

An object whose designator includes square brackets is a <<co-array 
subobject>>. For each co-array, co-subscripts are mapped to image indices 
in the same way as Fortran array subscripts are mapped to the position of 
the array element in array element order.

NOTE 2.4a
The use of square brackets for array constructors does not conflict
with their use for co-arrays because the left square bracket of the 
co-array syntax is immediately preceded by a designator for a variable.
[end NOTE]

On each image, the image index is available from the intrinsic
function THIS_IMAGE with no arguments, the set of subscript values for
a co-array A that correspond to the image are available as
THIS_IMAGE(A), and the image index that corresponds to a set of
subscript values SUB for a co-array A is available as
IMAGE_INDEX(A,SUB).

NOTE 2.4b
For example, on image 5, for the co-array declared as
        REAL :: A(10,20)[10,0:9,0:*]  
THIS_IMAGE() has the value 5 and THIS_IMAGE(A) has the value 
(/ 5,0,0 /). For the same example on image 213, THIS_IMAGE(A) 
has the value (/ 3,1,2 /). 
[end NOTE]

NOTE 2.4c
On a shared-memory machine, a co-array may be implemented as if it 
were an array of higher rank. On a 
distributed-memory machine with separate physical memory for each 
image, a co-array may be stored at the same virtual address in 
each physical processor. On any machine, a co-array may be 
implemented in such a way that each image can calculate the 
virtual address of an element on another image relative to the 
array start address on that other image. An implementation might 
arrange for each co-array to be stored at the same virtual 
address in each image, but this is not required. 
[end NOTE]

The <<co-rank>> of a co-array is the number of co-subscripts. The 
<<co-bounds>> and <<co-extents>> are given within square 
brackets in the co-array's declaration or allocation. The <<co-size>> 
of a co-array is always equal to the number of images.

.......................................................................
[19:5] In the last line of the first paragraph of 2.5.1, after 
'array element selectors,' add 'image selectors,'.

.......................................................................
[28:4+] Insert 'END CRITICAL' in the table in 3.3.1

.......................................................................
[50:6+] After the second line of R441, add 
          <<or>> DIMENSION [(<deferred-shape-spec-list>)] 
          <left-square-bracket> <co-array-spec> <right-square-bracket>

.......................................................................
[50:9+] After the first line of R442, add 
      [<left-square-bracket><co-array-spec><right-square-bracket>] 

.......................................................................
[50:25+] After C440, add

C440a (R440) Each <co-array-spec> shall be a 
<deferred-shape-spec-list> and the component shall be specified 
with the ALLOCATABLE attribute.

.......................................................................
[51:20+] Before NOTE 4.28, add new paragraph:

A data component is a co-array if its <component-decl> contains 
a <co-array-spec> or its <data-component-def-stmt> contains a 
DIMENSION <component-attr-spec> with a <co-array-spec>. If the 
<component-decl> contains a <co-array-spec>, it specifies the 
co-rank; otherwise, the <co-array-spec> in the DIMENSION 
<component-attr-spec> specifies the co-rank.

.......................................................................
[71:21+] In R503, after the DIMENSION line, add 

    <<or>> DIMENSION [(<array-spec>)] 
          <left-square-bracket><co-array-spec><right-square-bracket>

.......................................................................
[72:9] Separate R504 into two lines after '[(<array-spec>)]' and 
insert line:
       [<left-square-bracket><co-array-spec><right-square-bracket>]

.......................................................................
[72:25+] After C510, add

C510a (R501) A co-array that has the ALLOCATABLE attribute shall 
be specified with a <co-array-spec> that is a <deferred-shape-
spec-list>.

.......................................................................
[72:33] In the second line of C514, after 'an allocatable entity,' add 
'a co-array'.

.......................................................................
[73:1+] After C517, add

C517a (R501) The SAVE attribute shall be specified for a co-array 
unless it is allocatable, a dummy argument, or declared in the main 
program.

NOTE 5.2a
An allocatable co-array is not required to have the SAVE attribute 
because a recursive procedure may need separate allocatable 
co-arrays at each level of recursion. 
[end NOTE]

C517b (R501). If an object of derived type has a co-array component 
at any level of component selection, each ancestor of the co-array 
component shall be a non-allocatable non-pointer scalar.

C517c (R501). The POINTER attribute shall not be specified for a co-
array. 

NOTE 5.2b.
A co-array may be of a derived type with pointer or allocatable 
components. The targets of such components always reside on the
local image.

If a large array is needed on a subset of images, it is wasteful
of memory to specify it directly as a co-array.  Instead, it 
should be specified as an allocatable component of a co-array 
and allocated only on the images on which it is needed. 
[end NOTE]

.......................................................................
[74:19+] After the definition of an automatic data object, add a new
constraint:

C538a (R501) An automatic data object shall not be a co-array.

.......................................................................
[74:20-] After NOTE 5.3, add a new note:

NOTE 5.3a
Automatic co-arrays are not permitted; for example, the co-array 
WORK in the following code fragment is not permitted to be declared 
thus
       SUBROUTINE SOLVE3(N,A,B)
       INTEGER :: N
       REAL :: A(N)[*], B(N)
       REAL :: WORK(N)[*]  ! Not permitted
[end NOTE]

.......................................................................
[78:3-9] Replace the first paragraph of 5.1.2.5 by

The <<DIMENSION attribute>> specifies that an entity is an array, a 
co-array, or both. The appearance of an <array-spec> or a <co-array-
spec> in an <entity-decl> specifies the DIMENSION attribute for the 
entity. Such an entity is an array if an <array-spec> appears and is 
a co-array if a <co-array-spec> appears. The DIMENSION attribute 
alternatively may be specified in the specification statements 
DIMENSION, ALLOCATABLE, POINTER, TARGET, or COMMON.

For an array, the rank or rank and shape is specified by the <array-
spec>, if there is one, in the <entity-decl>, or by the <array-spec> 
in the DIMENSION <attr-spec> otherwise. For a co-array, the co-rank 
or co-rank and co-shape are specified by the <co-array-spec>, if there
is one, in the <entity-decl>, or by the <co-array-spec> in the 
DIMENSION <attr-spec> otherwise. 

.......................................................................
***Note to Editor: This edit replaces the one for this line from 
05-234r2

[78:14] Replace C541 by

R510a <co-array-spec> <<is>> <deferred-shape-spec-list>
                      <<or>> <assumed-size-spec>

C541 (R510 and R510a) The sum of the rank and co-rank shall not 
exceed fifteen.

.......................................................................
[85:6] Replace the last word, "program." of the first sentence of
5.1.2.16 Volatile, with 
"program, or by execution of statements on another image in the case of
a co-array variable."

.......................................................................
[87:34+] After R529, add

C552a (R525). A <data-stmt-set> shall not contain any image 
              selectors (6.2a). 

.......................................................................
[90:2-5] Replace the contents of 5.2.6 by

R535  <dimension-stmt> <<is>> DIMENSION [::] <dimension-decl-list>

R535a <dimension-decl> <<is>> <array-name>(<array-spec>) 
                       <<or>> <co-array-name>[(<array-spec>)] 
            <left-square-bracket><co-array-spec><right-square-bracket>

This statement specifies the DIMENSION attribute (5.1.2.5) and 
the array and co-array properties for each object named.

.......................................................................
[91:19+] After C570, add

C570a (R544). A common block that contains a co-array shall be 
specified to have the SAVE attribute in every scoping 
unit in which it appears. 

.......................................................................
[92:4-5] Replace R546 by

R546  <target-stmt> <<is>> TARGET [::] <target-decl-list>

R546a <target-decl> <<is>> <object-name>[(<array-spec>)] 
          [<left-square-bracket><co-array-spec><right-square-bracket>]

.......................................................................
[96:12+] After C577, add

C577a (R556). An <equivalence-object> shall not contain an image 
selector (6.2a). 

.......................................................................
[98:22+] After C588, add

C588a (R558). A <common-block-object> shall not contain an image 
selector (6.2a). 

C588b (R558). Blank common shall not contain a co-array. 

.......................................................................
[105:2] Append to the end of R613 '[<image-selector>]'

.......................................................................
[105:9+] After C613, add

C613a (R613). If <image-selector> appears and <part-name> is an array, 
(<section-subscript-list)> shall appear.

.......................................................................
[110:2-] Add new section at the end of 6.2. 

6.2a Image selectors

An <<image selector>> specifies the image whose data are referenced or 
defined.

R622a <image-selector> <<is>> 
          <left-square-bracket><subscript-list><right-square-bracket>

The value of a subscript in an image selector shall be within the 
bounds for its co-dimension. An image selector shall select an image 
with index in the range 1, ..., NUM_IMAGES().

NOTE 6.15a
For example, if there are 16 images and the co-array A is 
declared
    REAL :: A(10)[5,*]
A(:)[1,4] is valid since it has co-subscript order value 16, but
A(:)[2,4] is invalid.
[end NOTE]

.......................................................................
[110:20] In R628, after '[(<allocate-shape-spec-list>)]' add the
new line '[<left-square-bracket><allocate-co-array-spec>
<right-square-bracket>]'.

.......................................................................
[111:5+] After R632, add 'R632a <allocate-co-array-spec> <<is>> 
[<allocate-shape-spec-list>,] [<lower-bound-expr>:]* '.

.......................................................................
[111:17] Add at the end of C628 'An <allocate-co-array-spec> shall 
appear if and only if the <allocate-object> is a co-array.'

.......................................................................
[111:19] Add at the end of C629 'The number of <allocate-shape-spec>s 
in an <allocate-co-array-spec> shall be one less than the co-rank of 
the <allocate-object>.'

.......................................................................
[111:25+] After C633, add

C633a (R629) An <allocate-object> shall not be a co-array subobject.

NOTE 6.15b
If a co-array is of a derived type that has an allocatable component, 
the component shall be allocated only on the local image:

      TYPE(SOMETHING), ALLOCATABLE ::  T[:]
        ...
      ALLOCATE(T[*])          !  Allowed - implies synchronization
      ALLOCATE(T%PTR(N))      !  Allowed - local allocation
      ALLOCATE(T[Q]%PTR(N))   !  Not allowed 
[end NOTE]

.......................................................................
[113:21+] At the end of 6.3.1.1, add

The value of each <lower-bound-expr> and each <upper-bound-expr> in 
an <allocate-co-array-spec> shall not differ between images. 

If a <type-spec> appears in an ALLOCATE statement and any <allocation>
specifies a co-array, the values of each length type parameter shall
not differ between images.

If SOURCE= appears in an ALLOCATE statement and the <allocation>
specifies a co-array, the values of each length type parameter of the
<source-expr> shall not differ between images.

The dynamic type of an <allocate-object> that is a co-array shall not
differ between images. 

There is implicit synchronization of all images in association with 
each ALLOCATE statement that involves one or more co-arrays. Execution 
on an image, M, of the segment following the statement is delayed until 
all other images have executed the same statement as many
times as has image M. The segments that executed before the statement
on image M precede the segments that execute after the statement 
on another image T.


NOTE 6.19a
When an image executes an ALLOCATE statement, communication is not
necessarily involved apart from any required for synchronization.  The
image allocates the local part and records how the corresponding parts
on other images are to be addressed.  The processor, except perhaps in
debug mode, is not required to enforce the rule that the bounds are
the same on all images, nor is it responsible for detecting
or resolving deadlock problems.
[end NOTE]

.......................................................................
[116:19-] At the end of 6.3.3.1, add

There is implicit synchronization of all images in association with each 
DEALLOCATE statement that involves one or more co-arrays. All images 
delay making the deallocations until they are all about to execute the 
same DEALLOCATE statement. The segments that executed before the statement
on image M precede the segments that execute after the statement 
on another image T.

If an object that has a co-array component at any level of component 
selection is declared in a procedure and does not have the SAVE
attribute, there is an implicit deallocation (and associated 
synchronization) before the procedure in which it is declared is 
exited by execution of a RETURN or END statement.

NOTE 6.25a
An allocatable co-array without the SAVE attribute may be required if 
separate arrays are needed at each level of recursion in a recursive 
procedure. For allocation of such a co-array, each image must descend 
to the same level of recursion or deadlock may occur.
[end NOTE]

.......................................................................
[139:1+] Add to the end of the first paragraph of 7.4.1.2:

If <variable> is an allocatable co-array, it shall be allocated and
the shapes of <variable> and <expr> shall conform. If <variable> is a
co-array subobject of a type that has an allocatable component at any
level of component selection, the shapes of the corresponding
components of <variable> and <expr> shall conform.

C715a (R734) The <variable> in an intrinsic assignment statement shall
not be a co-array subobject of a derived type that has a pointer
subcomponent (6.1.2).

NOTE 7.34a
The restriction in C715a is needed to avoid a disallowed pointer 
assignment for a component, such as
       Z[I] = Z ! Not allowed if Z has a pointer component 
       Z = Z[I] ! Not allowed if Z has a pointer component 
[end NOTE]

.......................................................................
[143:31+] After C723, add 

C723a (R739) A <data-target> shall not be a co-array subobject. 

NOTE 7.42a
A pointer and its target always reside on the same image. A co-array 
may be of a derived type with pointer or allocatable components. For 
example, if P is a pointer component, Z[I]%P is a reference to the 
target of component P of Z on image I. This target must reside on 
image I and must have been established by an allocate statement 
executed on image I or a pointer assignment executed on image I.
[end NOTE]

.......................................................................
[143:37+] After C725, add 

C725a (R741) The <variable> in a <proc-component-ref> shall not be a 
co-array subobject. 

NOTE 7.42b
A co-array is permitted to be of a type that has a procedure pointer
component or a type bound procedure. Such a procedure shall not be 
invoked remotely; for example, the statement
      CALL A[I]%PROC(X) ! Remote reference not allowed
is not permitted. 
[end NOTE]

.......................................................................
[155:2] At the start of 8, after 'The execution sequence' add 
'of a single image'. 

[155:3] In the second line of 8, after 'execution sequence.' add 
'This is the subject of 8.1, 8.2, 8.3, and 8.4; image synchronization 
for exchange of data between images is the subject of 8.5.'

.......................................................................
[170:25-26] Change the first two sentences of 8.4 to

Execution of a STOP statement on an image causes normal termination 
(2.3.4) of execution of the program on all images. At the time of
termination, the stop code from the image executing the STOP 
statement, if any, is available in a processor dependent manner. At 
most one image shall make a stop code available.

.......................................................................
***Note to Editor: This edit should be applied following the edit for
[170:29+] from 05-231r4

[170:29+] After 8.4, add new section:

8.5 Image execution control

The execution sequence on each image is as specified in 2.3.4.

Each of the following statements affect the execution ordering between 
images and is an <<image control>> statement: 
(1)  SYNC_ALL statement,
(2)  SYNC_IMAGES statement,
(3)  SYNC_MEMORY statement,
(4)  NOTIFY statement,
(5)  QUERY statement,
(6)  ALLOCATE or DEALLOCATE statement involving a co-array, 
(7)  CRITICAL or END CRITICAL statement,
(8)  OPEN statement with a TEAM= specifier,
(9)  CLOSE, BACKSPACE, ENDFILE, or REWIND statement for a file that is 
     open with a TEAM= specifier,
(10) END or RETURN statement that involves an implicit deallocation of 
     a co-array, and
(11) CALL statement for a collective subroutine (13.1).

On each image, the sequence of statements executed between the execution 
of two image control statements (or before the first image control 
statement or after the last image control statement) is known as a 
<<segment>>. The segment preceding an image control statement includes 
the evaluation of all expressions within the statement. 

By execution of image control statements and user-defined ordering 
constructs (8.5.5), the program may ensure that the execution of segment 
S_I on image I is certain to precede or succeed the execution of segment 
S_J on image J. If the program does not ensure this, segments S_I and S_J 
are <<unordered>>; depending on the relative execution speeds of the 
images, some or all of the execution of S_I may take place at the same 
time as some or all of the execution of S_J. 

A scalar variable that is of type default integer, default logical, 
default real, or default bits, and has the VOLATILE attribute (5.1.2.16) 
may be referenced during the execution of a segment that is unordered 
relative to the execution of a segment in which
the variable is defined. Otherwise, if a co-array variable is defined on 
an image in a segment, it shall not be referenced or defined in a segment 
on another image unless the segments are ordered. 

NOTE 8.22
Apart from the effects of volatile variables, the processor may optimize
the execution of a segment as if it were the only image in execution.  
[end NOTE]  
   
NOTE 8.22a
The model upon which the interpretation of the standard is based is
there is a permanent memory location for each co-array variable and that
all images may access it. In practice, an image may make a copy of a 
non-volatile co-array variable (in cache or a register, for example) and, 
as an optimization, defer copying a changed value back to the permanent 
location while it still needs it. Since the variable is not volatile, it 
is safe to defer this transfer to the end of the current segment and 
thereafter to reload from permanent memory any co-array variable that was 
not defined within the segment. It would not be safe to defer these 
actions beyond the end of the current segment since another image might 
reference the variable then. 
[end NOTE]


8.5.1 SYNC_ALL statement

R851 <sync-all-stmt>  <<is>> SYNC_ALL [([<sync-stat-list>])]
R852 <sync-stat>      <<is>> STAT = <scalar-int-variable>
                      <<or>> ERRMSG = <scalar-default-char-variable>
 
C835 (R851) No specifier shall appear more than once in a given 
            <sync-stat-list>.

C836 (R852) A scalar variable in a STAT= specifier, or ERRMSG= 
            specifier shall not contain an <image-selector> (6.2a).

The STAT= and ERRMSG= specifiers are described in 8.5.6.

Execution of a <sync-all-stmt> performs a synchronization of all images. 
Execution on an image, M, of the segment following the <sync-all-stmt> 
is delayed until all other images have executed a <sync-all-stmt> as many
times as has image M. The segments that executed before the 
<sync-all-stmt> on image M precede the segments that execute after the 
corresponding <sync-all-stmt> on another image T.

NOTE 8.23
The processor may have special hardware or employ an optimized algorithm 
to make the <sync-all-stmt> execute efficiently.

Here is a simple example of its use. Image 1 reads data and broadcasts 
it to other images:
 
      REAL :: P[*]
        ...
      SYNC_ALL
      IF (THIS_IMAGE()==1) THEN
         READ(6,*)P
         DO I = 2, NUM_IMAGES()
            P[I] = P
         END DO
      END IF
      SYNC_ALL
[end NOTE]

NOTE 8.23a 
If synchronization is required before all images commence execution, a
SYNC_ALL statement should be the first executable statement of the main 
program. This is necessary if the code relies on the initialization of a 
co-array variable on another image. 
[end NOTE]


8.5.2 SYNC_IMAGES statement

R853 <sync-images-stmt> <<is>> SYNC_IMAGES (<image-set> [,<sync-stat-list>])
R854 <image-set>        <<is>> <int-expr>
                        <<or>> *

C837 (R854) An <image-set> that is an <int-expr> shall be scalar or of rank 
            one and shall not contain an <image-selector> (6.2a).

If <image-set> is an array expression, the value of each element shall be 
in the range 1, 2, ..., NUM_IMAGES(), there shall be no repeated values,
and at least one element shall have a value other than THIS_IMAGE().

If <image-set> is a scalar expression, its value shall be in the range 
1, 2, ..., NUM_IMAGES().  

An <image-set> that is an asterisk specifies all the images. 

Execution of a <sync-images-stmt> performs a synchronization of the image 
with each of the other images in the <image-set>. Execution on an image, M, 
of the segment following the <sync-images-stmt> is delayed until all other 
images T in the <image-set> have executed a <sync-images-stmt> with M in 
its <image-set> as many times as image M has executed a <sync-images-stmt> 
with T in the <image-set>. The segments that executed before the 
<sync-images-stmt> on image M precede the segments that execute after the 
corresponding <sync-images-stmt> on image T.

NOTE 8.24
Here is an example where the images are divided into two teams, one for
an ocean calculation and one for an atmosphere calculation. 

      INTEGER, ALLOCATABLE :: TEAM(:)
      INTEGER :: N2, STEP, NSTEPS
         
      N2 = NUM_IMAGES()/2
      ALLOCATE (TEAM(1:N2))
      OCEAN = THIS_IMAGE<=N2
      IF(OCEAN) TEAM = (/ (I, I=1,N2) /)
      IF(.NOT.OCEAN) TEAM = (/ (N2+I, I=1,N2) /)
         : ! Initial calculation
      SYNC_ALL
      DO STEP = 1, NSTEPS
         IF (OCEAN) THEN
            DO 
                : ! Ocean calculation
               SYNC_IMAGES(TEAM)
               IF ( ... ) EXIT ! Ready to swap data
            END DO
         ELSE
            DO 
                : ! Atmosphere calculation
               SYNC_IMAGES(TEAM)
               IF ( ... ) EXIT ! Ready to swap data
            END DO
         END IF
         SYNC_ALL
           :  ! Swap data 
      END DO

In the inner loops, each set of images works entirely with its own data 
and each image synchronizes with the rest of its team.  The number of 
synchronizations for the ocean team may differ from the number for the
atmosphere team. The SYNC_ALL statement is needed to ensure that both
teams have done their calculations before data is swapped. 
[end NOTE]

NOTE 8.25
In NOTE 8.24, the images of each team all wait for each other. There may,
however, be situations where this is not efficient. In the following 
example, each image synchronizes with its neighbor. 

      INTEGER :: ME, NE, STEP, NSTEPS
      NE = NUM_IMAGES()
      ME = THIS_IMAGE()
         : ! Initial calculation        
      SYNC_ALL
      DO STEP = 1, NSTEPS
         IF (ME > 1) SYNC_IMAGES(ME-1)
           : ! Perform  calculation
         IF (ME < NE) SYNC_IMAGES(ME+1)
      END DO
      SYNC_ALL

The calculation starts on image 1 since all the others will be waiting 
on SYNC_IMAGES(ME-1). When this is done, image 2 can start and image 1 
can perform its second calculation. This continues until they are all 
executing different steps at the same time. Eventually, image 1 will 
finish and then the others will finish one by one. 
[end NOTE]


8.5.3 NOTIFY and QUERY statements

R855 <notify-stmt>  <<is>> NOTIFY (<image-set> [,<sync-stat-list>])
R856 <query-stmt>   <<is>> QUERY (<image-set> [,<query-spec-list>])
R857 <query-spec>   <<is>> READY = <scalar-logical-variable>
                    <<or>> STAT = <scalar-int-variable>
                    <<or>> ERRMSG = <scalar-default-char-variable>

C838 (R856) No specifier shall appear more than once in a given
            <query-spec-list>.

C839 (R857) A scalar variable that is a STAT= specifier, or
            ERRMSG= specifier shall not contain an <image-selector> (6.2a).

The STAT= and ERRMSG= specifiers are described in 8.5.6.

Execution on image M of a NOTIFY statement with image T in its
<image-set> increments by 1 a record of the number of times, n(M,T), 
image M executed such a NOTIFY statement.

The execution of a QUERY statement on an image is called  
<<blocking>> if the QUERY statement has no READY= specifier or if it has 
a READY= specifier whose value after the statement has been executed is 
.true. . Execution on image M of a blocking QUERY statement with image T 
included in its image set increases by 1 a record of the number 
of times, b(M,T), image M executed such a QUERY statement. This 
increase is made after its value has been compared with n(T,M). 

If a READY= specifier appears, execution on image M of a QUERY
statement causes the <scalar-logical-variable> to become defined. The
value is true if, for each image T in the image set, n(T,M) > b(M,T).
Otherwise, the value is false. 

If a READY= specifier does not appear, increasing b(M,T) and completing
execution of the statement is delayed until, for each T in the image set, 
n(T,M) > b(M,T).

For a blocking QUERY statement on image M with image T in its image set, 
the NOTIFY statement execution on image T for which n(T,M) = b(M,T) + 1 
is said to correspond to it. Segments on image T executed before the 
execution of this NOTIFY statement precede the executions of the segments
on image M that follow this QUERY statement.

NOTE 8.26

The NOTIFY and QUERY statements may be used to order statement
executions between a producer and consumer image.

INTEGER,PARAMETER :: PRODUCER = 1, CONSUMER = 2
INTEGER :: VALUE[*]
LOGICAL :: READY

SELECT CASE (THIS_IMAGE())

CASE(PRODUCER)
   VALUE[CONSUMER] = 3
   NOTIFY(CONSUMER)
CASE(CONSUMER)
   WaitLoop: DO
      QUERY(PRODUCER,READY=READY)
      IF(READY) EXIT WaitLoop
      ! Statements not referencing, or causing to become defined or
      ! undefined VALUE[PRODUCER] or VALUE[CONSUMER]
   END DO WaitLoop
   ! references to VALUE
CASE DEFAULT
   ! Statements not referencing, or causing to become defined or
   ! undefined VALUE[PRODUCER] or VALUE[CONSUMER]
END SELECT

Unlike SYNC_IMAGES statements, the number of notifications and 
corresponding queries may be unequal. A program can complete with an 
excess number of notifies.
[end NOTE]

NOTE 8.27
NOTIFY/QUERY pairs can be used in place of SYNC_ALL and SYNC_IMAGES to 
achieve better load balancing and allow one image to proceed with 
calculations while another image is catching up. Here is an example:

   :
IF (THIS_IMAGE()==1) THEN
   DO I=1,100 
       : ! Primary processing of column I
      NOTIFY(2) ! Done with column i
   END DO
   SYNC_IMAGES(2)
ELSE IF (THIS_IMAGE()==2) THEN
   DO I=1,100 
      QUERY(1) ! Wait till 1 is done with column I
       : ! Secondary processing of column I
   END DO
   SYNC_IMAGES(1)
END IF 
[end NOTE]

NOTE 8.28
The incorrect sequencing of image control statements can halt execution
indefinitely. For example, one image may be executing a <sync-all-stmt>
while another is executing an allocate statement for a co-array; or one
image may be executing a blocking QUERY statement for which an image in 
its image set never executes the appropriate NOTIFY statement. 
[end NOTE]


8.5.4 CRITICAL construct

A critical construct may be used to limit execution of a block to one
image at a time.

R858 <critical-construct> <<is>> <critical-stmt>
                                 <block> 
                                 <end-critical-stmt>
R859 <critical-stmt>      <<is>> [<critical-construct-name>:] CRITICAL    
R860 <end-critical-stmt>  <<is>> END CRITICAL 
                                 [<critical-construct-name>]   

C840 (R858) If the <critical-stmt> of a <critical-construct> specifies
a <critical-construct-name>, the corresponding <end-critical-stmt> 
shall specify the same <critical-construct-name>. If the 
<critical-stmt> of a <critical-construct> does not specify a 
<critical-construct-name>, the corresponding <end-critical-stmt> 
shall not specify a <critical-construct-name>. 

The effect of the construct is to limit the execution of <block> to a
single image at any one time. The processor shall ensure that once an 
image has commenced executing <block>, no other image shall commence 
executing it until the image has completed executing it. If image T is
the next to execute the construct after image M, the segments that 
executed before the construct on image M precede the segments that 
execute after the construct on image T.

NOTE 8.29
If more than one image executes the block of a critical construct, its
execution by one image always either precedes or succeeds its
execution by another image.  Typically no other statement ordering is
needed. Consider the following example:

   CRITICAL
       global_counter[1] = global_counter[1] + 1
   END CRITICAL

The definition of global_counter[1] by a particular image will always
precede the reference to the same variable by the next image to
execute the block.
[end NOTE]

NOTE 8.30
The following example permits a large number of jobs to be shared among 
the images:

    INTEGER :: NUM_JOBS[*], JOB

    IF (THIS_IMAGE() == 1) READ(*,*) NUM_JOBS
    SYNC_ALL
    DO
       CRITICAL
          JOB = NUM_JOBS[1]
          NUM_JOBS[1] = JOB - 1
       END CRITICAL
       IF (JOB > 0) THEN
          ! Work on JOB
       ELSE
          EXIT
       END IF
    END DO
    SYNC_ALL
[end NOTE]


8.5.5 User-defined ordering constructs

User-defined constructs may be used to order the execution of segments 
on different images. If one image, Q, executes a construct, Cq, that 
does not complete until a corresponding construct, Cp, is executed on 
image P, then executions of segments before Cp on image P precede the 
executions of segments on image Q after Cq.

R861 <sync-memory-stmt> <<is>> SYNC_MEMORY [([<sync-stat-list>])]

The <sync-memory-stmt> provides a separator on an image between two 
adjacent segments. 

NOTE 8.31 
The primary purpose of the <sync-memory-stmt> is to provide 
segment separators for user-defined ordering constructs.

A common and important example is the spin-wait loop. 

    LOGICAL,VOLATILE :: LOCKED[*] = .TRUE.
    INTEGER :: IAM

    IAM = THIS_IMAGE()
    IF (IAM == P) THEN
       ! Preceding segment
       SYNC_MEMORY
       LOCKED[Q] = .FALSE.           ! construct Cp
       SYNC_MEMORY
    ELSE IF (IAM == Q) THEN
       DO WHILE (LOCKED); END DO     ! construct Cq
       SYNC_MEMORY
       ! Following segment
    END IF

The spin-wait loop can be used to implement specialized ordering
schemes. It can be more specific than a NOTIFY/QUERY pair because
independent spin variables can be used for each loop.  Because the
spin loop references a local variable, this method for execution
ordering may be very efficient and appropriate for performance
sensitive sections of a program.
[end NOTE]


NOTE 8.32
A user-defined ordering construct may also be formed using a 
synchronization subroutine defined by the user or available in a 
separate library. For example:

     INTEGER :: IAM
     REAL        :: X[*]

     IAM = THIS_IMAGE()
     IF  (IAM == 1) X = 1.0
     SYNC_MEMORY
     CALL EXTERNAL_SYNC()
     SYNC_MEMORY
     IF (IAM == 2) WRITE(*,*) X[1]

where the subroutine EXTERNAL_SYNC has an effect similar to SYNC_ALL.  
In this example, the constructs Cp and Cq are both the CALL statement.
[end NOTE] 

8.5.6 STAT= and ERRMSG= specifiers in image execution control statements.

If the STAT= specifier appears, successful execution of the SYNC_ALL,
SYNC_IMAGES, SYNC_MEMORY, NOTIFY, or QUERY statement causes the 
<scalar-int-variable> to become defined with the value zero. If an error 
occurs during execution of one of these statement, the 
<scalar-int-variable> becomes defined with a processor-dependent positive 
integer value. If an error condition occurs during execution of a 
SYNC_ALL, SYNC_IMAGES, SYNC_MEMORY, NOTIFY, or QUERY statement that does 
not contain the STAT= specifier, the effect is processor dependent. 

If the ERRMSG= specifier appears and an error condition occurs during
execution of the SYNC_ALL, SYNC_IMAGES, SYNC_MEMORY, NOTIFY, or QUERY 
statement, the processor shall assign an explanatory message to 
<scalar-default-char-variable>. If no such condition occurs, the 
processor shall not change the value of <scalar-default-char-variable>.

NOTE 8.33
Which errors, if any, are diagnosed is processor dependent. The processor
might check that a valid set of images has been provided, with no 
out-of-range or repeated values. It might test for network time-outs;
while the overall program would probably not be able to recover from the
failure of an image, it could perhaps provide information on what failed 
and be able to save some of the program state to a file.

[181:46+] After C905, add

 C905a (R907a) A <rank-one-int-expr> is an <int-expr> that is of rank 
       one and type integer. 

.......................................................................
[185:4+] Add new subsection at the end of 9.4.5:

 9.4.5.16 TEAM= specifier in the OPEN statement

The <rank-one-int-expr> shall evaluate to a set of integers
that have values in the range 1 to NUM_IMAGES() and there shall be no 
repeated values. One element shall have the value THIS_IMAGE(). This 
specifies the <<connect team>> for the unit, which is the set of 
images that are associated with the unit. If there is no TEAM= 
specifier, the connect team is (/THIS_IMAGE()/).

All images in the connect team, and no others, shall invoke the same 
OPEN statement with identical values for the <connect-spec>s. The 
unit shall not be open on other images. There is implicit synchronization 
of all images in the <connect-team>. Images do not commence executing 
subsequent statements until all images finish executing the OPEN 
statement. If images M and T are members of the team, the segments that 
executed before the statement on image M precede the segments that 
execute after the statement on image T.

The OPEN statement connects the file on the invoking images only, and 
the unit becomes unavailable on all other images. If the OPEN statement 
does not have a FILE= specifier and the unit is not connected to a file, 
the processor shall connect the same file to the unit on all images in 
the connect team. 

If the connect team contains more than one image, the OPEN statement 
shall have an ACCESS= specifier that evaluates to DIRECT or an ACTION=
specifier that evaluates to WRITE.

NOTE 9.21a
Writing to a sequential file from more than one image is permitted for 
situations in which the ordering of records is unimportant. An example
is for diagnostic output that is labelled with the image index.  
[end NOTE]

An OPEN statement on a unit connected to a file by a previously executed 
OPEN statement shall have the same connect team as currently in effect.

NOTE 9.21b
The rule in 9.4.3 that a unit shall not be connected to more than one file 
at the same time and a file shall not be connected to more than one unit
at the same time applies even if the connect teams for the units have no 
images in common.
[end NOTE]

Pre-connected units have a connect team consisting of all the images.
Input on pre-connected units shall be performed only on the image with 
index one.

NOTE 9.21c
The input unit identified by * is therefore only available on
the image with index one.
[end NOTE]

.......................................................................
[185:19+] Add new paragraph at the end of 9.4.6:

At the start of execution of a CLOSE statement, there is an implied 
FLUSH operation for the unit. There is implicit synchronization of all 
images in the <connect-team>. Images do not commence executing subsequent 
statements until they all finish executing the same CLOSE statement. If 
images M and T are members of the team, the segments that executed before 
the statement on image M precede the segments that execute after the 
statement on image T.

.......................................................................
[208:4+] Add new paragraph at the end of 9.7.1:

At the start of execution of a BACKSPACE statement, there is an implied 
FLUSH operation for the unit. There is implicit synchronization of all 
images in the <connect-team>. Images do not commence executing subsequent 
statements until they all finish executing the same BACKSPACE statement. 
If images M and T are members of the team, the segments that executed 
before the statement on image M precede the segments that execute after 
the statement on image T.

.......................................................................
[208:19+] Add new paragraph at the end of 9.7.2:

At the start of execution of an ENDFILE statement, there is an implied 
FLUSH operation for the unit. There is implicit synchronization of all 
images in the <connect-team>. Images do not commence executing subsequent 
statements until they all finish executing the same ENDFILE statement. 
If images M and T are members of the team, the segments that executed 
before the statement on image M precede the segments that execute after 
the statement on image T.


.......................................................................
[208:23+] Add new paragraph at the end of 9.7.3:

At the start of execution of a REWIND statement, there is an implied 
FLUSH operation for the unit. There is implicit synchronization of all

statements until they all finish executing the same REWIND statement. 
If images M and T are members of the team, the segments that executed 
before the statement on image M precede the segments that execute after 
the statement on image T.

[269:13+] In 12.4.1.2, Actual arguments associated with dummy data 
objects, add a new paragraph and note:

If the actual argument is a co-array subobject, the dummy argument 
shall not be a co-array and shall have the INTENT(IN) or the VALUE 
attribute. A co-array subobject shall not be an actual argument if 
it has a pointer subcomponent.

NOTE 12.21a
If the actual argument is a co-array subobject and the corresponding
dummy argument is not a co-array, it is expected that implementations
will make a local copy of the actual argument, including copies of any 
allocatable subcomponents, before execution of the procedure starts.
[end NOTE]

.......................................................................
[269:17+] After the sixth paragraph of 12.4.1.2, add new paragraphs:

If a dummy argument is an allocatable co-array, the actual argument 
shall be an allocatable co-array of the same rank and co-rank.

If a dummy argument is a co-array that is not allocatable, the co-rank
and co-bounds are specified by the local declaration and are
independent of those of the actual argument. The actual
argument shall be the name of a co-array or a subobject of a co-array
without any co-subscripts, vector-valued subscripts, allocatable
component selection, or pointer component selection.

NOTE 12.21b
Only the local part of the co-array actual argument is specified and 
this is associated with the local part of the dummy co-array. It is 
assumed that the rest of the actual co-array consists of the 
corresponding parts on the other images. Here is an example
    INTERFACE
      SUBROUTINE SUB(X,Y)
        REAL :: X(:)[*], Y(:)[*]
      END SUBROUTINE SUB
    END INTERFACE
       :
    REAL, ALLOCATABLE :: A(:)[:], B(:,:)[:]
     :
    CALL SUB(A(:),B(1,:)) 
[end NOTE]

Each image independently associates each non-allocatable co-array
dummy argument with a co-array that is not a dummy argument (perhaps
through several layers of procedure calls). Any reference to a
co-array subobject of the dummy argument uses the local co-bounds and
co-rank.

NOTE 12.21c
It is expected that a procedure with a co-array dummy argument will often 
be called simultaneously on all the images of a team with the same actual
co-array and the same bounds and co-bounds. However, there are other

[end NOTE]

If an assumed-shape array or a subobject of an assumed-shape array
appears as an actual argument corresponding to a dummy co-array, the
dummy co-array shall be of assumed shape. 

A pointer component, an allocatable component that is not a co-array, 
or a subobject of such a component shall not be an actual argument 
that corresponds to a co-array dummy argument.

If an array section appears as an actual argument corresponding to a 
dummy co-array that is not of assumed shape, the section shall be 
contiguous (5.1.2.4a).

***Note to editor: Section number 5.1.2.4a is specified in paper 05-273r3, 
for feature J3-043.

These subroutines return an array of the same shape as the given co-
array after having applied an operation across the images involved.
The simple case of wanting the operation to be applied to all the 
elements of the co-array can easily be programmed, for example
    REAL FUNCTION GLOBAL_SUM(ARRAY)
       REAL      :: ARRAY(:,:)[*]
       REAL,SAVE :: TEMP[*]
       TEMP = SUM(ARRAY) ! Local sum
       CALL CO_SUM(TEMP,GLOBAL_SUM)

<<Class.>> Collective subroutine.

<<Arguments.>>

MASK shall be a co-array of type logical. It is an INTENT(IN) argument. 

RESULT shall have the same type, kind type parameter, and shape as MASK.
     It is an INTENT(OUT) argument. An element has the value true if all
     the corresponding elements of MASK are true on all the images of TEAM,
     and the value false otherwise.

TEAM (optional) shall be of rank one and type integer.  It is an INTENT(IN)
     argument. All the elements shall have values in the range 
     1<=TEAM(I)<=NUM_IMAGES(); there shall be no repeated values and one

     is treated as if it were present with the value 
     (/ (I,I=1,NUM_IMAGES()) /).
               
<<Example.>> If NUM_IMAGES() has the value 2 and MASK has the values 
(/.TRUE.,.FALSE.,.TRUE./) and (/.TRUE.,.TRUE.,.TRUE./) on the two 
images, the statement

     is treated as if it were present with the value 
     (/ (I,I=1,NUM_IMAGES()) /).
  
<<Example.>> If NUM_IMAGES() has the value 2 and MASK has the values 
(/.TRUE.,.FALSE.,. FALSE./) and (/.TRUE.,.TRUE.,.FALSE./) on the two 
images, the statement
     CALL CO_ANY(MASK,RESULT)

C.9a.1 Module for THIS_IMAGE and IMAGE_INDEX 

The intrinsics THIS_IMAGE(ARRAY) and IMAGE_INDEX(ARRAY,SUB) cannot be 
coded in Fortran since ARRAY may be of any type and THIS_IMAGE(ARRAY) 
needs to know the index of the image on which the code is running. 

We therefore require the bounds to be specified as integer arrays and 
we require the image index for THIS_IMAGE(ARRAY).
