To:      X3J3/WG5
From:    John Reid
Subject: Schedule for Fortran 2000


When Fortran 90 was finally comleted, WG5 spend considerable time
forming a Strategic Plan, the latest version of which is Standing
Document 4 or N1151. WG5 was determined that never again would it
allow a new standard to be delayed indefinitely. The plan therefore
includes a schedule and the intention was that this be kept to,
even at the expense of delaying some features to a further revision.
The dates are shown in the table below. I also show the dates that
X3J3 is using for planning purposes, see X3J3/97-010. The new rules
over DIS ballots force us to revise this. I propose that we plan
still to have two rounds of CD balloting. This allows us to gain
two months, enough time to squeeze another X3J3 meeting into the
X3J3 schedule.
