DISCUSSION

The following problems have been highlighted in other papers:

1. A C descriptor may be copied in C, which is often OK, but not for
allocatable arrays (see 11-126).

2. Restrictions are needed on what changes are permitted in C to the
values of the members of a C descriptor (see 11-127). There is a
danger that we will miss necessary restrictions.

3. Updating C descriptors is allowed under some circumstances, but not
others. E.g. C descriptors for assumed-shape dummies may not be updated.

Also Craig Rasmussen pointed out in an email that we are missing
CFI_bounds_to_cdesc.

These problems may be avoided by following Nick Maclaren's
"ALTERNATIVE APPROACH" in 10-235 of replacing three of the present
functions by three new ones. The functions suggested here are not
exactly those of 10-235 but are similar. I believe that they will
be far more convenient than the present functions and provide all the
functionality that a C programmer needs to interact with Fortran.
For example, it is easy to establish an assumed-shape array or an
array section and there is no need for complicated rules on what is
allowed and what is not allowed.

Initializing, updating, or copying C descriptors in other ways will be
outwith the Standard. Accessing the members will be permitted, of
course. Also, altering the value of the array it describes will be
permitted, but not the properties of this array.

No changes are proposed for the functions CFI_address, CFI_allocate,
CFI_deallocate, and CFI_is_contiguous. Paper 11-123 proposes the
removal of CFI_cdesc_to_bounds. I propose to replace the other three
by these four:

CFI_establish_cdesc  Establish a C descriptor for an assumed-shape
               array, an unallocated allocatable, or a pointer.
CFI_setpointer Alter a C descriptor for a pointer.
CFI_section    Initialize a C descriptor for a section of a given array.
CFI_select_part  Initialize a C descriptor for a section of parts of the
                 elements of a given array.

If this paper is accepted, the edit for [16:18+] in 11-134 will not be
needed.

This paper addresses the issues in UTI TR7.


EDITS to N1838:

[9:11] In 5.2.1 Summary of contents, in the list of functions that
have prototypes in ISO_Fortran_binding.h, add the names of the
functions added by this paper, arranging the list in alphabetical
order.


In 5.2.6 Functions, delete subclauses 5.2.6.2 (CFI_create_cdesc),
5.2.6.3 (CFI_initialize_cdesc), and 5.2.6.5 (CFI_associate) and add
the following subclauses to 5.2.6 alphabetically based on the function
names:

5.2.6.x int CFI_establish_cdesc ( CFI_cdesc_t * dv, void *
    base_addr, CFI_attribute_t attribute, CFI_type_t type, size_t
    elem_len, CFI_rank_t rank, const CFI_dim_t dim[] );

Description. CFI_establish_cdesc establishes a C descriptor for an
assumed-shape array, an assumed-length character object, an
unallocated allocatable, or a pointer. The properties of this object
are given by the other arguments.

The argument dv shall point to a C object large enough to hold a C
descriptor of the appropriate rank.  It shall not point to a C
descriptor that describes an object that is described by a C
descriptor pointed to by a formal parameter that corresponds to a
Fortran dummy argument.  If it points to a C descriptor that describes
an allocatable object, the object shall be unallocated.


If the argument base_addr is not NULL, it is used to set the base
address of the object. It shall be appropriately aligned
(ISO/IEC 9899:1999 3.2) for an object of the specified type. If it is
derived from the C address of a Fortran object, CFI_establish_cdesc
shall establish a C descriptor for that object or a subobject of it.
If the argument base_addr is NULL, CFI_establish_cdesc establishs
a C descriptor for an unallocated allocatable, or a unassociated
pointer.

The argument attribute shall be one of CFI_attribute_assumed,
CFI_attribute_allocatable, or CFI_attribute_pointer.  If the argument
attribute is CFI_attribute_assumed, the argument base_addr shall not be
NULL. If the argument attribute is CFI_attribute_allocatable, the
argument base_addr shall be NULL. If the argument attribute is
CFI_attribute_pointer and the argument base_addr is the C address of a
Fortran object, the Fortran object shall have the TARGET attribute.

The argument type shall be one of the type names in Table 5.2.

The argument elem_len is ignored unless type is CFI_type_other or a
character type. If the type is CFI_type_other, elem_len shall be
greater than zero and equal to the size of an element of the
object. If the object is a Fortran character, the value of elem_len
shall be the length of an element of the character object.

The argument rank shall be between 0 and 15 inclusive. If the argument
rank is zero or the argument base_addr is NULL, the argument dim is
ignored; otherwise, it points to an array with rank elements
specifying the dim information.


The function returns an error indicator.

Example 1. The following code fragment establishes a C descriptor for
an unallocated rank-1 allocatable array to pass to Fortran for
allocation there.
   CFI_rank_t rank;
   CFI_dim_t dim[1];
   CFI_CDESC_T(1) field;
   int ind;
   rank = 1;
   ind = CFI_establish_cdesc ( &field, NULL, CFI_attribute_allocatable,
                     CFI_type_double, 0, rank, dim );

Example 2. If source already points to a C descriptor for the Fortran
array a declared thus:

  type,bind(c) :: t
    REAL(C_DOUBLE) x
    complex(C_DOUBLE_COMPLEX) y
  end type
  type(t) a(100)

the following code fragment establishes a C descriptor for the array
a(:)%y.

   struct { double x; double complex y;} t;
   CFI_dim_t dim[1];
   CFI_CDESC_T(1) component;
   int ind;
   dim[0]->lower_bound = 0;
   dim[0]->extent = 100;
   dim[0]->sm = sizeof(struct t);
   ind = CFI_establish_cdesc ( &component,
             (char *)source->base_addr+offsetof(struct t, y),
             CFI_attribute_assumed, CFI_type_double_Complex,
             0, source->rank, dim );



5.2.6.x int CFI_setpointer ( CFI_cdesc_t * ptr_dv,
               CFI_cdesc_t * source, const CFI_dim_t dim[]);

Description.  CFI_setpointer updates a C descriptor for a Fortran
pointer.

The argument ptr_dv shall point to a C descriptor for a Fortran
pointer. It is updated using information from the source and dim
arguments, resulting in a new pointer descriptor.


The argument source shall be NULL or point to a C descriptor for an
assumed-shape array, an allocatable object, or a pointer object. If
source is NULL or points to a C descriptor for an allocatable object
that is not allocated or a pointer that is not associated, the new
pointer object becomes disassociated.

If source is not NULL, the elem_len, rank, and type members of the
source C descriptor shall be the same as the corresponding members of
the cdesc C descriptor. If source is not NULL and the base_addr of
the source C descriptor is the C address of a Fortran object, the
Fortran object shall have the TARGET attribute.

If dim is NULL or the rank is zero, the new pointer object is the
object described by the source C descriptor. Otherwise, dim shall
point to an array of rank elements and it specifies the dim
information and of a section of the object described by the source C
descriptor. This section is the pointer object described by the
updated descriptor pointed to by ptr_dv.

The function returns an error indicator.

Example. If ptr already points to a C descriptor for an array
pointer of rank 1, the following code makes it point instead to the
section with bounds and stride (1:100:5).

   CFI_dim_t dim[1];
   int ind;
   dim[0]->lower_bound = 1;
   dim[0]->extent = 20;
   dim[0]->sm = 5*ptr->dim[0].sm;
   ind = CFI_setpointer ( &ptr, &ptr, dim );



5.2.6.x int CFI_select_part ( CFI_cdesc_t * result,
        CFI_attribute_t attribute,
        const CFI_cdesc_t * source, CFI_type_t type,
        size_t displacement, size_t elem_len );

Description.  CFI_component establishes a C descriptor for an array
whose elements are parts of the corresponding elements of an
array. The parts may be a component of a structure, a substring, or
the real or imaginary part of a complex value.

The argument result shall point to a C object large enough to hold a C
descriptor of the appropriate rank.  It shall not point to a C
descriptor that describes an object that is described by a C
descriptor pointed to by a formal parameter that corresponds to a
Fortran dummy argument.  If it points to a C descriptor that describes
an allocatable object, the object shall be unallocated.

The argument attribute shall be CFI_attribute_assumed or
CFI_attribute_pointer and determines whether the C descriptor pointed
to by result on exit describes an assumed-shape array or array pointer.

The C descriptor pointed to by source shall describe an assumed-shape
array, an allocated allocatable array, or an associated pointer array.
The values of the arguments displacement and elem_len shall be between
0 and the elem_len member of the C descriptor pointed to by source.

On exit, the C descriptor pointed to by result will describe an
array whose type is given by the argument type, and whose
base address is the base address of the source array plus the value of
the argument displacement. The resulting base address shall be
appropriately aligned (ISO/IEC 9899:1999 3.2) for an object of the
specified type.

The argument elem_len is ignored unless type is CFI_type_other or a
character type. If the type is CFI_type_other, elem_len shall be
greater than zero and equal to the size of an element of the
object. If the object is a Fortran character, the value of elem_len
shall be the length of an element of the character object.

The function returns an error indicator.

Example. If source already points to a C descriptor for the Fortran
array a declared thus:

  type,bind(c):: t
    real(C_DOUBLE) :: x
    complex(C_DOUBLE_COMPLEX) :: y
  end type
  type(t) a(100)

the following code fragment establishes a C descriptor for the array
a(:)%y.

   double d;
   CFI_CDESC_T(1) component,;
   int ind;

   ind = CFI_select_part ( &component, CFI_attribute_assumed, &source,
         CFI_type_double_complex, sizeof(d), 0 );




5.2.6.x int CFI_section ( CFI_cdesc_t * result,
    CFI_attribute_t attribute,
    const CFI_cdesc_t * source, const CFI_dim_t dim[] );

Description.  CFI_section establishes the C descriptor pointed to by
result to refer to a section of an array pointed to by source.

The argument result shall point to a C object large enough to hold a C
descriptor of the appropriate rank.  It shall not point to a C
descriptor that describes an object that is described by a C
descriptor pointed to by a formal parameter that corresponds to a
Fortran dummy argument.  If it points to a C descriptor that describes
an allocatable object, the object shall be unallocated.

The argument attribute shall be CFI_attribute_assumed or
CFI_attribute_pointer and determines whether the C descriptor pointed
to by result on exit describes an assumed-shape or pointer array.

The C descriptor pointed to by source shall describe an assumed-shape
array, an allocated allocatable array, or an associated array pointer.

The argument dim points to an array rank elements specifying the dim
information of the array section.

The function returns an error indicator.

Example. If source already points to a C descriptor for the rank-1
Fortran array A, the following code fragment establishes a C descriptor
for the array section A(1:10:5).
   CFI_dim_t dim[1];
   CFI_CDESC_T(1) section;
   int ind;
   dim[0]->lower_bound = 0;
   dim[0]->extent = 2;
   dim[0]->sm = 5*source->dim[0].sm;
   ind = CFI_section ( &section, CFI_attribute_assumed, &source,
                     dim );


[16:7-18] Replace 5.2.7 Restrictions on the use of C descriptors by

5.2.7 Use of C descriptors

A C descriptor shall not be initialized, updated or copied other than
by calling the functions specified here. A C descriptor that is
pointed to by a formal parameter that corresponds to a Fortran dummy
argument with the INTENT(IN) attribute shall not be updated.

Calling CFI_allocate or CFI_deallocate for a C descriptor changes the
allocation status of the Fortran variable it describes and causes the
allocation status of any associated allocatable variable to change
accordingly (6.7.1.3 of ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010).

A C descriptor that is pointer to by a formal parameter or actual
argument that corresponds to a Fortran dummy argument in a BIND(C)
interface shall describe an object that is acceptable to both Fortran
and C with the type specified in its type member.


5.2.7+ Restrictions on lifetimes

When a Fortran object is deallocated, execution of its host instance
is completed, or its allocation or association status becomes
undefined, all C descriptors and C pointers to any part of it become
undefined, and any further use of them is undefined behavior (ISO/IEC
9899:1999 3.4.3).

A C descriptor that is pointed to by a formal parameter that
corresponds to a Fortran dummy argument becomes undefined on return
from a call to the function from Fortran.  If the dummy argument does
not have any of the TARGET, ASYNCHRONOUS or VOLATILE attributes, all C
pointers to any part of the object it describes become undefined on
return from the call, and any further use of them is undefined
behavior.

If a pointer to a C descriptor is passed as an actual argument, the
lifetime of the C descriptor and that of the object it describes
(ISO/IEC 9899:1999 6.2.4) shall not end before the return from the
function call.  A Fortran pointer variable that is associated with the
object described by a C descriptor shall not be accessed beyond the
end of the lifetime of the C descriptor and the object it describes.
