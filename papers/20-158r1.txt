Subject: Technical issues UTI-005 and UTI-006 in DO CONCURRENT REDUCE
Date: 2020-October-12

Reference: 19-252r2, 20-007

Background
==========

In F202x, we added a new locality clause, REDUCE.

In UTI-005, the editor noticed that the bounds of a REDUCE variable with
the POINTER attribute is not defined. We propose an edit to correct
this.

In UTI-006, the editor pointed out that REDUCE entities carry along the
POINTER attribute of the outer entity uselessly. The suggestion is to
use semantics similar to associate names. An edit is proposed.

The proposed edits lead to a slight reorganization of the new and
remaining sentences for clarity.


Edits to 20-007r1
=================

{ edits in page order }


{ 11.1.7.5 Additional semantics for DO CONCURRENT constructs }

{ UTI-005 Add bounds to attributes shared with the outer entity }

[190:22-24 p3] A variable that has REDUCE locality is a construct entity
with the same type, type parameters, and rank as the variable with the
same name in the innermost executable construct or scoping unit that
includes the DO CONCURRENT construct, and the outside variable is
inaccessible by that name within the construct.

In sentence one of paragraph 3, line 22, replace "same type, type
parameters, and rank" with "same type, type parameters, rank, and
bounds" so that the first sentence of paragraph 3 reads:

"A variable that has REDUCE locality is a construct entity with the same
type, type parameters, rank, and bounds as the variable with the same
name in the innermost executable construct or scoping unit that includes
the DO CONCURRENT construct, and the outside variable is inaccessible by
that name within the construct."

{ the construct has the same bounds as the outer entity }



{ UTI-006 POINTER REDUCE variables should behave like TARGET }

[190:24-27 p3] Sentence two now reads "The construct entity has the
CONTIGUOUS, POINTER, or TARGET attribute if and only if the outside
variable has that attribute; it does not have the ALLOCATABLE, BIND,
INTENT, PROTECTED, SAVE, or VALUE attribute, even if the outside
variable has that attribute."

Change this to 3 sentences: "The construct entity has the CONTIGUOUS
attribute if and only if the outside variable has that attribute. It has
the TARGET attribute if and only if the outside variable has either the
TARGET or POINTER attribute. It does not have the ALLOCATABLE, BIND,
INTENT, POINTER, PROTECTED, SAVE, or VALUE attribute, even if the
outside variable has that attribute."

{ POINTER attribute in outer variable becomes TARGET in construct entity }



{ UTI-005 Remove unnecessary reference to bounds }

[190:27-28 p3] Sentence three of paragraph 3 reads: "If it is not a
pointer, it has the same bounds as the outside variable."

Delete this sentence.

{ remove exclusion of bounds when outside entity has POINTER attribute }



{ UTI-006 Remove unnecessary reference to pointer association }

[190:30-31 p3] Sentence 6 reads "The pointer association of the
construct entity shall not be changed within the DO CONCURRENT
construct."

The construct entity can no longer have the POINTER attribute, so its
pointer association can't be changed.

Delete sentence 6.

{ Reference to changing pointer association is deleted }



{ 11.1.7.5 Reorganize for clarity }
On reflection, it makes sense to group all references to the attributes
of the construct entity into a single paragraph, and begin a new
paragraph when discussing execution of the iterations.

The paragraph formerly known as 3 would become:

[190:22-32] "A variable that has REDUCE locality is a construct entity
with the same type, type parameters, rank, and bounds as the variable
with the same name in the innermost executable construct or scoping unit
that includes the DO CONCURRENT construct (the outside variable). The
outside variable is inaccessible by that name within the construct. The
outside variable shall not be an unallocated allocatable variable or a
pointer that is not associated.

The construct entity has the CONTIGUOUS attribute if and only if the
outside variable has that attribute. It has the TARGET attribute if and
only if the outside variable and has either the TARGET or POINTER
attribute. It does not have the ALLOCATABLE, BIND, INTENT, POINTER,
PROTECTED, SAVE, or VALUE attribute, even if the outside variable has
that attribute.

At the beginning of execution of each iteration, the construct entity is
assigned an initial value corresponding to its reduce-operation as
specified in Table 11.1."

{ each paragraph now has a specific purpose }

{ end }
