Subject:    No interp needed for MOVE_ALLOC with identical arguments
Date: 2016 February 11

There is no need for an F2008 interp for this issue.  The program does
not conform because the allocation status of FROM is changed other than
through its corresponding dummy argument: it is changed because the TO
argument (which is identical to the FROM argument) has the INTENT(OUT)
attribute.

The issue described below is answered by the existing text so no interp
is needed.  The unaltered text from 16-128 follows.

NUMBER: F08/nnnn
TITLE: What does MOVE_ALLOC with identical arguments do?
KEYWORDS: MOVE_ALLOC
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

What does the following program print?

  module M1
    real, public, allocatable :: Z
  end module M1
  module M2
    use M1
  end module M2
  program P
    use M1, only : X => Z
    use M2, only : Y => Z
    allocate ( x )
    call move_alloc ( x, y )
    print *, allocated(y)
  end program P

Keep in mind that X and Y are different local names for the same
variable.

13.7.118p6 (in 10-007r2) says FROM (X) has become deallocated.  The TO
argument description says it's INTENT(OUT), so the first thing that
happens is to deallocate Y.  But 13.7.118p4 says that TO (Y) becomes
allocated if FROM (X) is allocated "on entry."  Is "on entry" before
or after INTENT(OUT) deallocates it?

Is Y allocated or deallocated after the call?

If Y is allocated after the call, was its allocation status
"affected?"  This bears on the question whether the following program
(with the same modules as above) conforms, i.e., is the allocation
status of the dummy argument of subroutine S affected other than
through the dummy argument?

  program P
    use M1, only : X => Z
    use M2, only : Y => Z
    allocate ( x )
    call s ( y )
    print *, allocated(y)
  contains
    subroutine S ( Y )
      use M1, only: Z
      integer, allocatable, intent(inout) :: Y
      call move_alloc ( x, z )
    end subroutine S
  end program P

ANSWER 1:

Because the TO argument of MOVE_ALLOC has the INTENT(OUT) attribute,
it becomes deallocated before the processor notices that the FROM
argument had been allocated "on entry."  Therefore, the program prints
F.  The allocation status of the single variable corresponding to TO
and FROM is changed.

Edits are provided to clarify this.

ANSWER 2:

Because the FROM argument was allocated "on entry," the TO argument is
allocated upon return.  Therefore, the program prints T.  The
allocation status of the single variable corresponding to TO and FROM
is not changed.

{This is the answer at least some users want.}

Edits are provided to clarify this.

ANSWER 3:

The program does not conform because the allocation status of FROM is
changed other than through its corresponding dummy argument: it is
changed because the TO argument has the INTENT(OUT) attribute.

{Intrinsic procedures are "magic," so this isn't necessarily required
for consistency with procedures defined by the program.}

EDIT 1:

In subclause 13.7.118, paragraph 4 [10-007r2:372:23], after
"unallocated on entry to MOVE_ALLOC" insert ", or if FROM and TO are
the same variable".

Alternative (or additional) EDIT 1:

In subclause 13.7.118, after paragraph 4 [10-007r2:372:25+], insert a
note:

  "NOTE 13.18a
     Because the TO argument has the INTENT(OUT) attribute, if it is
     allocated it becomes unallocated on entry.  If TO and FROM are
     the same variable, FROM is thereby unallocated on entry."

EDITS 2:

In subclause 13.7.118, in the description of the TO argument
[10-007r2:372:20], replace "INTENT(OUT)" with "INTENT(INOUT)".

Before paragraph 4 [10-007r2:372:23-] insert the following paragraph:

"If FROM and TO are the same variable, the subroutine returns without
taking any action; the allocation status of the variable is not
affected, and the pointer association status of any pointer associated
with the variable is not affected.  Otherwise, if TO is allocated on
entry, it becomes unallocated."

Possible additional EDITS 2:

Within paragraph 5 [10-007r2:372:27], after "have the TARGET
attribute" insert "and TO and FROM are not the same variable".

Within paragraph 6 [10-007r2:372:29], replace "The" with "If TO and
FROM are not the same variable, the".

It is probably not necessary to adjust NOTE 13.19.

EDIT 3:

None.
