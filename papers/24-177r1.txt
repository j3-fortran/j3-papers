1. Introduction
---------------
Many existing Fortran projects make extensive use of C preprocessor
directives and expansion. This is usually done to tailor the code to
specific environments, such as target compilers or machines.

Existing compiler implementations behave differently in the presence of
these directives, hampering portability.

This document attempts to define the requirements for a standardized
Fortran preprocessor (herein called FPP). The guiding principle is to
promote Fortran program portability by defining consistent syntax and
semantics of a subset of the C preprocessor. Some FPP behavior will need
to be different than the C preprocessor (herein called CPP) to
accommodate some Fortran idiosyncrasies.


2. The basic idea: phases before the "processor"
------------------------------------------------
The preprocessor will be a mandatory part of the language. Any file
passed to a processor may contain preprocessor directive lines.

The C standards define eight phases of the compilation process. These
phases don't prescribe the details of an implementation, but are useful
for defining in focused terms the expected behavior of implementations.

We plan to take a similar approach for defining FPP. This should
simplify the explanation of the expected behavior of any given
implementation.

The directive language accepted by FPP is based on the syntax of CPP. It
is not Fortran, but can contain arbitrary Fortran tokens. It differs
from C and Fortran syntax in the following ways:
    1. FPP's directives and token recognition are case sensitive.
    2. FPP treats blanks adjacent to tokens as significant, even in
       fixed-form source files.
    3. FPP directive lines accept backslash (\) for line continuations.
    4. FPP does not recognize fixed-form (column 6) or free-form (&)
       continuations on directive lines.
    5. FPP does not recognize '!' as initiating a comment on directive
       lines.
    6. FPP does not recognize '//' as initiating a comment on directive
       lines.
    7. FPP recognizes /* ... */ C-style comments on directive lines.
    8. Expressions in #if and #elif directives contain constructs from
       both Fortran and CPP.
    9. Expressions in #if and #elif directives that evaluate to LOGICAL
       or INTEGER values. .TRUE. or a non-zero integer are considered
       true.
    10. Undefined identifiers are treated as zero, as in CPP.
    11. Integer expressions in preprocessor directives are calculated in
       the maximum precision the processor supports. (There are no KIND
       specifiers on integer constants in the preprocessor.)


3. FPP Phase 1: Line conjoining
-------------------------------
The C language defines phase 2 as a pass where continuation lines are
removed. To simplify the explanation of FPP's preprocessing phase 2, we
will define phase 1 to simply remove continuation lines seen in the
source file. This will apply to both fixed-form and free-form source
Fortran lines and preprocessor directive lines. The output of this phase
is a sequence of "logical lines", each of which may be up to 1 million
characters long. Logical lines are a sequence of strings and
comment-strings in the same order as they are encountered in the input
stream.


4. FPP Phase 2: Directive processing
------------------------------------
The directive processing phase is analogous to CPP phase 4. Preprocessor
directives are executed. Macros are expanded in non-preprocessor lines
(Fortran source lines).

Macros are expanded in comment lines that appear to be pragma directives
(e.g. '!$omp' or '!$acc' or additional processor-specific choices).

#pragma lines are expanded into Fortran 'pragma' lines (a new feature).


4.1. Directives accepted by the preprocessor
--------------------------------------------
    #line
    #define  including function-like macros and those
             that uses the ellipsis notation in the parameters
    #undef
    #ifdef and #ifndef
    #if, #elif, #else
    #include
    #error
    #pragma

Just as #include lines interpolate the source from other files, the
preprocessor will include the text from Fortran INCLUDE lines


4.2 Tokens accepted on #define directives
-----------------------------------------
    - # (stringify)
    - ## (token concatenation)
    - Any valid Fortran token
    - Any C operator allowed in a #if or #elif expression
    - Any macro names defined by the preprocessor


4.3 Operators accepted in #if and #elif expressions
---------------------------------------------------
    - The "defined" operator
    - From C: && || == != < > <= >= + / * ! & | ^ ~ ( )
    - From Fortran: = /= .AND. .OR. .NOT.


4.4 Macros defined by the preprocessor
---------------------------------------------
    __LINE__
    __FILE__
    __DATE__
    __TIME__
    __STDF__
    __STDF_VERSION__
    __VA_ARGS__  in the replacement-list of a function-like macro
      that uses the ellipsis notation in the parameters.
    __VA_OPT__  in the replacement-list of a function-like macro
      that uses the ellipsis notation in the parameters.

__STDF__ and __STDF_VERSION__ are analogs to the CPP __STDC__ (1) and
__STDC_VERSION__ (e.g., 201710) macros, allowing conditional compilation
based on the version of the Fortran standard supported by the processor.


4.5. Fortran awareness during macro expansion
---------------------------------------------
Just as CPP does not expand tokens in strings, there are places in
Fortran lines that FPP should not recognize or expand tokens.

FPP will not expand in fixed-form
    - A token "C" or "c" in column 1.
    - Anything in column 6.


FPP will not expand tokens in either fixed- or free-form:
    - In character constants
    - In FORMAT statements
    - In the letter-spec-list in an IMPLICIT statement.


4.6 Output of Phase 2
---------------------
Similar to phase 1, the output is a sequence of logical lines where the
logical lines contain the strings representing the now-preprocessed
characters of the input file and comment-strings.
