This is basically a rewrite, with some additions, of paper 237
from meeting 177.  I was going to do a more extensive paper
much earlier, but A) I lost my notes from 177, and B) stuff
came up.

I'm also not proposing edits.  It strikes me as pointless to
do detailed edits unless we have a reasonable consensus that
these are things we want to do.  

This paper proposes three new features:

1)   An assignment to a macro variable.  The syntax is
      MACRO  macro-local-variable = macro-expr

This is fundamentally syntactic sugar. . But look at note
3.15 on page 39.  The token "SELECTED_INT_KIND(i)"
appears in 3 places.  Some short of short-hand will make
things easier to read.

It would be nice to have two forms.  One to hold computed
numeric values, such as a kind type, and the other to hold
long concatenated strings.  Sort of a MACRO associate
concept to shorten the source text.

2)   Add some sort of "get next kind" capability, and maybe
      enhance the MACRO DO.

Paper 273 proposed adding this to the existing MACRO design
and the straw vote was 9-1-1 in favor of investigating this.

I propose adding a set of new MACRO pseudo functions,
MACRO_NEXT_???_KIND.  Where ??? can be INT, REAL, CHAR,
LOGICAL, or BIT.  Each function returns the next used
kind number for the appropriate type.  This will
make it easy to run over all of the available kinds.  If the
argument is -1 or missing, the functions return the lowest
kind value.  If the argument is greater than -1, they return
the next higher kind value.  If there are no more kinds, they
return -2.  If the argument is < -1, they generate an
expansion-time error.  We need to start at -1 because 0
is an allowed kind.


Normal usage would be
        MACRO  J = -1
        MACRO DO
          MACRO J = MACRO_NEXT_INT_KIND(J)
          MACRO IF (J<-1) MACRO EXIT
             blah blah
        MACRO END DO

This requires also allowing a MACRO DO with no limit.  We could
merely require the user to do  MACRO DO JJ = 1,1000000000000000
to simulate an infinite DO.  But, that is silly.  An unlimited
MACRO DO also requires a MACRO EXIT.

An alternative would be to define integer arrays that hold the
kind values.  MACRO_???_KIND_VALUES, for example.  Then the
above loop could be written as

        MACRO DO  JJ = 1, size(MACRO_INT_KIND_VALUES)
          MACRO J = MACRO_INT_KIND_VALUES(JJ)
             blah blah
        MACRO END DO

With no need for extending the MACRO DO capability.  A possible
drawback to this approach is BITs.  An expectation is that
processors will allow billions and billions of BIT kinds.
However, depending on what 53:30 really means, the array
might be trivial because MACRO_BIT_KIND_VALUES(J) will be J.

Either the function or arrays could be placed in chapter 13
and available outside of the macro facility.  That's an
orthogonal decision.

3)  Add a MACRO ERROR statement.

It's folly to think macro writers and users won't make
mistakes.  Add a new statement
       MACRO ERROR  [something useful]

It's difficult to specify an error statement and describe what it
means in standard terms.  For essentially all of the other rules,
we basically say a standard conforming program shan't do something
or other.  But, we don't say what should happen if it does and this
allows processors to freely extend the standard.  How do we say 
that the MACRO ERROR should stop the translation?  Malcolm's
first thought was to say that a MACRO ERROR shall not be expanded.
This is what most of the other constraints do.  If a processor
wants to extend the standard by plowing through a MACRO ERROR,
it's free to do so.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Subgroup recommends the following:

1)  Adding arrays of kinds to the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV module
       The arrays would be processor dependent size and contain
       values of the supported kind parameters for each type.

   The /B subgroup favored the NEXT_KIND function approach, with
the addition of an uncounted MACRO DO and a MACRO EXIT statement.

2)  Adding a macro assignment statement.  Based on discussions with 
/B, we believe two kinds of assignment are needed.  One to
compute the value of a specification expressions and the other
to hold a token string.

3)  Adding a macro error statement

There are obvious straw votes.

1)  Add 4 parameter arrays, INT_KIND_VALUES, REAL_KIND_VALUES, 
    LOGICAL_KIND_VALUES, and CHAR_KIND_VALUES to ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.
   (But, NOT a BIT array.)  The values will be in non-decreasing order 
    by storage size.

OR

    Add 5 new macro functions, one for each of the kinds BITS, INTEGER,
    REAL, LOGICAL, and CHARACTER.  The functions would return the next
    supported kind value, or -2 if there were no more kinds supported.

2)  Add two forms of a MACRO assignment statement and add a new macro
    variable type, which is an untyped token string.
      MACRO  macro-local-variable = macro-expr
      MACRO  macro-token-variable = basic-token-sequence

See paper 06-380 from Malcolm for proposed specs, syntax, and edits.

3)  Add a MACRO ERROR statement.
       MACRO ERROR  [something useful]
  CONSTRAINT   A MACRO ERROR statement shall not be expanded
