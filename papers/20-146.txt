UTI 012 on page 207 of 20-007:

Unresolved Technical Issue 012

Is NOTIFY= meant to work only on coarrays and not pointer components
thereof?

That is, after
      x[17,notify=n]%ptr = something ! ptr is a data pointer component.

on image 3, and a corresponding NOTIFY WAIT(n) on image 17, is image
17 allowed to access its x%ptr? The paper used the term "coarray" in
the notify= exception here, which would imply not. I changed this to
"variable" instead, but it undeniably more complicated to
implement... (NB: This is the sentence that now begins "A variable
defined in an unordered segment only"; according to the paper that
should have been "A coarray defined in an unordered segment only".)

Answer:

Yes, there is no reason NOTIFY could not be used for a component
(including pointer or allocatable component) of a coindexed object.
The entire assignment operation involved has 3 parts:

1) Determine the address on the remote image to which the data is
   stored.

2) Store the data to that address.

3) Complete the NOTIFY operation on the remote image in such a way
   that it is ensured to occur after the data is available on the
   remote image.

The only part of the process that is more complicated to implement for
a pointer component is part 1. That complication would occur even if
the NOTIFY is not specified.

The change from "coarray" to "variable" in 11.7.2 Segments, paragraph
3 (at [206:33]) is correct.
