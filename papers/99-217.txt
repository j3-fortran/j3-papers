Subject:  Interpretation Request 71 on Character Array Constructors


NUMBER: 000071
TITLE: Character array constructors
KEYWORDS: Character, array constructor, zero-size
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS:

The f95 standard appears to leave the length of zero-sized character array
constructors undefined.  The penultimate paragraph of clause 4.5 says

  "The type and parameters of an array constructor are those of the
   <ac-value> expressions."

If there are no elements, then the values of the type parameters might
not be defined.  The type and kind are always well defined at compile
time.  However, the length parameter for zero-sized character array
constructors is not obviously well-defined, even at run-time.

Zero-sized constructors are certainly allowed, as mentioned in the
antipenultimate paragraph of clause 4.5:

  "An empty sequence forms a zero-sized rank-one array."

Experimentation with different f90 compilers yields varying results.
In the sample of question 2 below, one compiler gave a compile-time
error message "array constructor has indeterminate character length".
(Interestingly, it also gave that message when n=1, which should have
been valid; some other variations gave compiler crashes).  Another
compiler gave the lengths as 2 and 5 and the n_calls as 1, obviously
evaluating the presumed first element, even when the result had, in
fact, no elements.

QUESTION 1:
Is the following a valid program and, if so, what len value does it print.

  program zero
    write (*,*) len( (/ ('abc', i = 1 , 0) /) )
  end

QUESTION 2:
Is the following a valid program and, if so, what value does it print.

    program zero_size
      integer :: n = 0
      call sub('abcdefghij', n)
    contains
      subroutine sub(string, n)
        character*(*) :: string
        integer :: n
        integer :: i
        write (*,*) len( (/ (string(:i+2), i = 1 , n) /) )
      end subroutine
    end program zero_size

QUESTION 3:
Is the following a valid program and, if so, what values does it print
for the lengths and for n_calls.

    program zero_size
      integer :: n = 0
      integer :: n_calls = 0
      call sub('abcdefghij', n)
      write (*,*) 'n_calls = ', n_calls
    contains
      subroutine sub(string, n)
        character*(*) :: string
        integer :: n
        integer :: i
        write (*,*) len( (/ (string(:f(i)), i = 1 , n), 'abcde' /) )
      end subroutine sub
      integer function f(i)
        f = 2*i + 5
        n_calls = n_calls + 1
      end function f
    end program zero_size

ANSWER:
(1) Yes.  The length is 3.
(2) No.  Edits supplied to make this illegal.

SV: (i) A zero-sized char array cons shall have at least one <ac-value> that is
        an initialization expression or a <variable> that is not a <substring>;
    (i-b) or a <substring> in whose <substring-range> all expressions are
          initialization expressions.
    (ii) A zero-sized char array cons shall have at least one <ac-value> whose
         character length does not depend on an <ac-do-variable>;
         (ii-a) and does not depend on the value of a non-intrinsic function
                reference
         (ii-b) a user function reference inside an <ac-implied-do> may be
                executed even when the loop trip count is zero.

(3) Yes.  The length printed is 5, n_calls is still zero.
