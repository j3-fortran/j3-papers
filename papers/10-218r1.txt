1. Introduction

This paper discusses various wording issues in 10-165r2, some of which rise
to the level of technical problems.  It is unclear whether resolving these
leads to any change in technical content.

No attempt has been made to check to see whether other papers modify the
wording in these places.


2. Problem 1: Functions

5.2.6.1 [11:3] starts with
  "Eight functions are provided for use in C functions."
However, I only count 5 functions.

{ Solution 1:  "Eight", as to avoid the changing count value. }

3. Problem 2: Descriptors "for" allocatables

(a) Contradiction.

The last sentence of [12:31-33] is contradictory: it first says that X
(the base address in the C descriptor for an allocatable object)
may be initialized to NULL, and then says X shall be modified only by
CFI_allocate or CFI_deallocate.  Initialization modifies the value
(from undefined to NULL in this case).

It is also confusingly phrased: X may be initialized, but "X's value"
cannot be modified.

(b) Technical flaw 1

According to 5.2.6.2, CFI_allocate can only be used on a C descriptor
with a base address that is NULL.  Therefore, if a "C descriptor for an
allocatable object" is not initialized to NULL, so that it's base address
is undefined, the descriptor cannot validly later be modified since the
rule in [12:31-33] prohibits modification other than via CFI_allocate or
CFI_deallocate, and neither CFI_allocate nor CFI_deallocate accept a
descriptor with an undefined base address.

(c) Technical flaw 2

Since initialization only occurs in the declarator (see C99:6.7.8), and the
fields of CFI_desc_t don't appear in any set order, initialization is
impossible.  Maybe I missed it, but surely there ought to be some
initialization function or macro provided, at least for convenience?

(d) Technical flaw 3

Taking the words at [12:31-33] to mean X can be initialized and X can be
subsequently modified only by CFI_allocate and CFI_deallocate, there is a
problem if you pass the CFI_desc_t to a Fortran routine that attempts to
ALLOCATE, DEALLOCATE, or MOVE_ALLOC it, since that would modify the
CFI_desc_t other than by CFI_allocate or CFI_deallocate.

(e) Vagarity: What does "for" mean?

That is, what does "C descriptor for an allocatable object" mean?

Obvious possibilities are:
(i)  CFI_desc_t with attribute==CFI_attribute_allocatable;
(ii) CFI_desc_t currently associated with (or "specifies") an
     allocatable object;
(iii) CFI_desc_t that will be associated with, or will specify,
      an allocatable object.

Together with (b) above, this renders invalid most code that attempts to
use CFI_desc_t to describe an allocatable object.

(f) Discussion

It seems that these words (5.2.6.2 and 5.2.7) need reconsideration.
Edits to correct the problems are deferred pending discussion.


4. Problem 3: Annex 2 confusing and wrong

(a) unclear terminology

A.2p1 [17:18-21], sentence 2 uses "implementation below" to mean "example",
but sentence 3 uses "C implementation" to mean ... what, exactly?  Possibly
to mean "procedure".

The word "implementation" in the Foreword to mean "Fortran processor".
I think.  Anyway, it is certainly a poor choice of word to mean example.

The use of passive form in the third sentence makes it sound like this is
some kind of general observation.

I don't know what a "two-dimension" array is.

The C code doesn't accept all 2D integer arrays, only INTEGER(C_INT) ones.

This all needs to be rewritten to be simpler.

(b) example incorrect

The interface in Fortran specifies a default real result, but the
definition in C specifies an INTEGER(C_INT) result.

The C function returns an error code if all arguments are "int", and
continues processing if any argument is not an int.

The C function returns an error code if all arguments are rank 2, and
continues processing if any argument is not of rank 2.

The C function returns an error code if all arguments have the same shape,
and continues processing if the arguments have different shapes.

The multi-line C statements are unbalanced (that's not an error, but it is
certainly a very individual style).

Personally I prefer also not to put spaces around "==" and "!=", so that
the spacing indicates the priority, but I did not include edits for that.


5. Edits to 10-165r2

[11:3] "Eight functions" -> "Functions".

[12:31-33] Replace the second sentence of para 1 of 5.2.7, "The base
address in ... CFI_deallocate functions." with

"The initial allocation status of an allocatable object shall be
unallocated. Subsequently, the base address in a C descriptor that
describes an allocatable object shall be modified only by the
CFI_allocate or CFI_deallocate functions or because of allocation or
deallocation in a Fortran procedure."


[17:18] "This example" -> "The example shown below".

[17:19-21] Replace entirely.
  "The Fortran interface of \cf{elemental_mult} will accept arguments of
   any type and rank.  However, the C function will return an error code if
   any argument is not a two-dimensional \cf{int} array.  Note that the
   arguments are permitted to be array sections, so the C function does not
   assume that any argument is contiguous."
{I used \cf{int} instead of INTEGER(C_INT) for brevity.  Either is fine.
 Plain "integer" is not.}

[17:25+] Insert new lines
  "use iso_c_binding
   integer(c_int) err".

[17:30] Replace with "The definition of the C function is:".

[17:46-47] Change all "==" to "!=", and both "&&" to "||".
{Return error on error, not on ok.}

[17:46-47] Rebalance these two lines, so we get
  "    if (a_desc->type!=CFI_type_int || b_desc->type!=CFI_type_int ||
           c_desc->type!=CFI_type_int) {".
{This edit is optional but recommended.}

[18:3] Change all "==" to "!=" and "&&" to "!=".
{Return error on error, not on ok.}

[18:11,12] Change all "==" to "!=" and "&&" to "!=".
{Return error on error, not on ok.}
