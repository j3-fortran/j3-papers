Subject: Recursive I/O
Ref:     UK-012

Specification:
  Allow I/O on other units during execution of an I/O statement.

Rationale:
  It is useful to be able to call tracing and diagnostic I/O routines
  in a subprogram used within an I/O statement.  This facility is
  commonly available in other languages and the present prohibition
  appears to be an anomaly in the standard.

Syntax:
  There is no new syntax for recursive I/O.

Edits:

  The edits are against 04-007.

  [219:10]  After "an external unit" insert "that is identified by
            another input/output statement being executed"

  The entire paragraph then reads:

    A recursive input/output statement shall not identify an external
    unit that is identified by another input/output statement being
    executed except that a child data transfer statement may identify
    its parent data transfer statement external unit.

  Editor, please note:
    Add text to page xiii for a new feature:
      "xx) I/O on other external units is now allowed during the
           execution of an I/O statement."
