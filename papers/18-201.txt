1. Introduction

This paper contains the response to  ballot comment JP025, which points
out that in 11.6.11 the descriptions of the value of the stat-variable
are not consistent:
- a processor-dependent positive value in paragraphs 3 and 5,
- a processor-dependent positive integer value in paragraph 9,
- a processor-dependent value in paragraph 10.

2. Response

All stat= variables are integer, see R942, so "integer" is redundant.
The values should be restricted to be positive in all cases. The edits
below are needed:


3. Edits to N2146

In 11.6.11 STAT= and ERRMSG= specifiers in image control statements:
Para 9, If the STAT= specifier appears in a sync-stat in a LOCK ...
      Change "processor-dependent positive integer value" to 
      "processor-dependent positive value".
Para 10, If an image completes execution of a CRITICAL ...
      Change "processor-dependent value" to 
      "processor-dependent positive value".
