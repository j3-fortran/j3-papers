A letter ballot N1763 was taken regarding the technical content of
N1761, "Further Interoperability of Fortran with C" (Interoperability
of optional, assumed-shape, allocatable, pointer, assumed-type, and
assumed-rank dummy arguments).  Several people replied to this ballot
with comments.  This paper is a reply to some of these comments.

The format of the reply below is:

Reply text:

1) [Van] A C descriptor has a flag that indicates whether a pointer is
   or is not associated.  It's not always possible to tell.  It is
   always possible to tell whether a pointer is or is not
   disassociated.

---

The description of the base_addr will be modified to say that the base
address of a zero-sized array shall not be NULL. In that case the
information in the "state" member of the descriptor is no longer
necessary and it will be deleted.


2) [Van] The "sm" component of a CFI_dim_t struct is specified to be
   measured in bytes.  This should be in processor-dependent units.

---

The "sm" (stride multiplier) is intended to have the same units as the
the units of the elem_len component of the C descriptor, and hence the
units of the C sizeof operator. The C standard (6.5.3.4) specifies
this unit to be "in bytes". Changing the units of the stride
multiplier to be potentially different seems like an unnecessary
complication.


3) [Aleks, Nick] Use a flexible array member at the end of the cdesc
   struct to hold the bounds triples, rather than a fixed-size array.

---

This change will be made in the specification.


4) [Mike] The file ISO_Fortran_binding.h is not included in the
   standard.

---

One of the ground rules for the TR is that no struct can be explicitly
specified in the standard. Instead, only descriptions of the struct
members are allowed.  Including a copy of ISO_Fortran_binding.h would
expose a suggested implementation of the cdesc struct, in violation of
this rule. Also, generally the standard does not mandate specific
implementations of things like this. Some vendors might, for example,
want to add extra, hidden members to the struct for various purposes.


5) [Mike] The general approach of specifying a data structure seems
   awkward compared to the approach of standardizing the particular
   set of APIs that the programmers will want.

---

The initial version of the TR was based on a set of functions / macros
that served as such an API.  This quickly grew into an MPI-like
monstrosity that would have been hard to use at best.  We switched to
the descriptor approach as cleaner and simpler to use.  Also,
minimizing the number of needed functions lowers the implementation
and maintenance costs for vendors.


6) [Mike] There is no "version" query for the structure or API.

---

A macro that expands to a version-specific integer constant will be
included in the file ISO_Fortran_binding.h.



7) [Mike] There is no pointer in the Fortran descriptor pointing to a
   corresponding C descriptor, resulting in an asymmetry.

---

The implementation model will be revised to eliminate visibility of a
Fortran descriptor.


8) [Nick] A "pointer of type void" is meaningless - C has no data type
   "void". The terminology should be fixed, everywhere the wording is
   used.

---

Where relevant, the term used will be changed to "pointer to void".


9) [Nick] "The C descriptor is a struct of type CFI_desc_t" is
   ambiguous.

---

The intention is that the struct be defined as

typedef { .......  } CFI_cdesc_t;

and declarations of descriptors of the form

CFI_cdesc_t  arg;

Improved wording is: "CFI_desc_t is a typedef name that designates a
structure type."


10) [Nick] The specification of the "attribute" field is broken. Inter
    alia, it mixes type properties with attributes, does not allow
    assumed-shape arrays to be allocatable or pointers, and makes no
    reference to assumed-rank.  I am not sure what it is proposing, or
    why. If it is needed, it should specify the attributes as bits in
    a mask.

---

Regarding the first sentence, it was never intended to provide for
assumed-shape arrays that are allocatable or pointers. No such things
exist in Fortran.

This will be reconsidered.



11) [Nick] The description of the "state" field is baffling. Why
    should assumed-shape but not assumed-rank be included together
    with associated pointers and allocatable variables?

---

In the reply to (1) above, this member is removed.



12) [Nick] The type "intptr_t" is unsuitable for array
    indexing... "ptrdiff_t" is a far better type for the purpose.

---

The array indexing type will be replaced by an abstracted typedef that
vendors can define as appropriate.


13) [Nick] The specification must say which kind of C constants are
    defined in the file ISO_Fortran_binding.h, as C has several, with
    different properties. That would need careful design.  Most of
    them should be preprocessor constants suitable for use in #if
    directives, but perhaps not all.

---

It is expected that these constants will be defined as macros in
ISO_Fortran_binding.h, for example,

#define CFI_xxx  value


Preferred wording: "The values given below shall be replaced by
    constant expressions suitable for use in #if preprocessing
    directives."


14) [Nick] The layout of C structures is very dependent on the
    compiler options. In the existing Fortran standard, the processor
    can (in theory, at least) remap structures. Because N1761 proposes
    structures to use as the actual interface descriptors, that is not
    feasible.  The matter needs consideration.

---

The specification does not require a particular form for structs. Care
will be taken to avoid the problems brought up.



15) [Nick] The description of stride "equal to the difference between
    the subscript values of consecutive elements of an array along a
    specified dimension" makes no sense when applied to a dummy
    argument - it is always one. Fortran has no concept of the strides
    of the actual arguments being visible to the called procedure."

---

This will be clarified.



16) [Nick] It is unclear is one has the ability to call the MPI
    transfer functions with arrays of interoperable derived types as
    choice arguments.

---

This is possible by defining an MPI datatype and using TYPE(*) in the
MPI interface.



17) [Nick] The current proposal has unnecessary restrictions and
    artificial distinctions between Fortran features.  For example,
    the current proposal allows for the passing of assumed-shape
    arrays but not assumed-length CHARACTER.

---

The proposal to make assumed-length character interoperable was
considered by WG5. The decision was to not include this in the TR.
This could be included in a future standard within the current design.


18) [Nick] A design should be considered that allows potential
    extensibility to interfacing with the C variable argument list
    mechanism.

---

This was discussed in subgroup and we do not intend to support this in
the TR.


19) [Nick]) At least potentially permit the companion processor to be
    a debugging tool (preferably passing object bounds across the
    interface for all arguments).  Perhaps the simplest and cleanest
    way of resolving many interoperability issues is to extend the
    BIND attribute slightly, to allow the programmer to select between
    the current interface and a descriptor-based one, along the lines
    of:

proc-language-binding-spec is
    BIND(C[,METHOD=binding_method][NAME=scalar-char-initialization-expr])

binding_method is DIRECT
               or DESCRIPTOR

The default is DIRECT, and is what we have at present.

---

This is an interesting idea.  It could be proposed as an extension for
a later Fortran standard.


20) [Nick] The design does not support ALLOCATABLE and POINTER arrays
    cleanly; in particular, the C descriptor does not contain enough
    information to update the pointer value correctly.  Changing the
    base address in the descriptor alone will NOT work.

---

The new specification no longer uses a Fortran descriptor. Further
limitations will ensure that these problems are avoided.



21) [Nick] The types need to include a non-interoperable type, for use
    with assumed-type arguments.  The existing standard already allows
    them to be passed between Fortran and C.

---

CFI_type_cptr and CFI_type_cfunptr will be added to the list.


22) [Nick] The specification of ISO_Fortran_binding.h should be
    specified to be unitary as the standard C headers are.

---

A citation to the relevant wording in the C standard will be included.



23) [Nick] The level of namespace pollution must also be specified,
    for future enhancements.

---

The following sentence will be added: "Names beginning with CFI__ will
be reserved for use by vendors, and names beginning with CFI_x where x
is not an underscore will be reserved for portable usage in the file
ISO_Fortran_binding.h wherever that file is included."


24) [Nick] The descriptor functions are impure and return an error
    code through their function result.  Because they are C
    interfaces, that is plausible, but it is undesirable to use a
    specification that conflicts with Fortran's conventions.  In
    particular, it would obstruct a vendor or future version of the
    standard from defining them as interoperable procedures.  That
    option should be left open.

---

This issue will be considered.


25) [Nick] The descriptor functions use the supplied descriptors both
    as the source of data and where they store the results, but they
    do not specify which fields must be set on entry and which are set
    on exit.

---

The text will be modified to better describe these functions.


26) [Nick] CFI_update_fdesc is specified to use malloc, but that is an
    unreasonable restriction on an implementation; the requirement
    should be removed.

---

In the new specification, the CFI_update_fdesc function is no longer
present.


27) [Nick] CFI_allocate says "The supplied bounds override any current
    dimension information in the descriptors. The stride values are
    ignored and assumed to be one. Both the Fortran and C descriptors
    are updated by this function."  That makes no sense, as it would
    leave the descriptors in an invalid state.  Also, the intent of
    CFI_bounds_to_cdesc is unclear, especially as it does not say that
    creating an invalid descriptor is forbidden.

---

Stating that creating an invalid descriptor is forbidden is implied by
"Errors might occur because values supplied in an argument are invalid
for that function" in discussion of error returns.  The circumstances
under which actions are invalid will be clarified.



28) [Nick] "The base address in the C descriptor for a data pointer
    may be modified by assignment and that change later affected in
    the corresponding Fortran descriptor by the CFI_update_fdesc
    function" means that allocatable and pointer arrays can be changed
    other than by calls to CFI_allocate and CFI_deallocate (which is
    stated to be forbidden elsewhere).  Something is wrong, but I
    don't know what.

---

In the new specification, the CFI_update_fdesc function is no longer
present.


29) [Nick] Wording should be added to forbid the bounds array to have
    a higher rank than the descriptor.

---

The text will be modified to forbid this.


30) [Nick] The examples use "integer(8)" to indicate an 8-byte integer
    set up by a compiler option "-i8".  That is completely
    processor-dependent, and should not be included in a Technical
    Report.  Also, the examples use MPI names, but are wildly invalid.
    They should use MPI correctly, or not refer to it.

---

The examples will be changed.


31) [Jim] Although Fortran descriptors are used when passing
    assumed-shape arrays, pointer arrays, and allocatable arrays by
    many vendors, they however are not universally used by all
    vendors.

---

In the new specification, the Fortran descriptor is no longer used, so
a vendor would not necessarily be required to define one.
