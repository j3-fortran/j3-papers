Subject: Deleting statement functions
Date 2005 August 9

At Delft, it was decided to delete the obsolescent feature
statement functions.  This paper attempts to provide edits to do so.

Edits consist of deleting all references to statement functions
in page order throughout 007.  A paragraph is moved within the appendix.
Edits are also provided to add a new paragraph to Section 1
describing the deleted feature.

Thanks to Van and Dick for useful comments,
which are incorporated herein.

Note that paper 05-254 updates obsolescent and deleted features
discussion generally.

Specifications:

Specifications are as per RU-003 as modified by N1638.

Move statement functions to the deleted list,
and delete them from the standard.

Syntax:

None.

Edits:

[vi] delete "12.5.4 Statement functions" and page number
[viii] delete "B.2.3 Statement functions" and page number
[3:9+] Add a new subsection before the current 1.6.1:
"1.6.1 Fortran 2003 compatibility

Except as identified in this section, this standard is
an upward compatible extension to the preceding Fortran
International Standard, ISO/IEC 1539-1:2004
(Fortran 2003). Any standard-conforming Fortran 2003 program remains
standard-conforming under this standard. The following Fortran 2003
features may have different interpretations in this standard:

(1) Earlier Fortran standards had the concept of statement functions.
Since Fortran 90, they have been
superseded by internal functions.  Statement functions
have been deleted in this standard."
