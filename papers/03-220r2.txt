Subgroup: There should be no requirement that the default character set has control characters.

[23:6] Delete '("newline", for example)'

       There might not be such a character.  It is not a particularly
       illuminating example.

Subgroup: Assuming newline exists for default characters, this is specified (e.g. See [235:1-7]).  It should return a blank if no newline exists (edits following).

[341:21] "," -> "and the character in position 10 of the ASCII collating
sequence is representable in the default character set,"

Subgroup: Finally, move a paragraph which is in the wrong place (this paragraph is not talking about "Other characters").

[24:15-20] Move to [23:20+].

Additional Section 9 edits.
182:7  Replace "which" with "that".

182:17+3, in note  Replace "may" with "might".

219:27   Replace "conditions" with "condition"
220:1    Replace "conditions" with "condition"
