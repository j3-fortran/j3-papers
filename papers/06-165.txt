Subject: Co-arrays to be optional

This paper expresses the personal opinion of the authors and is not a
formal UK position.

Despite being initially in favour of extending Fortran to accommodate
parallel architecture, we believe that there are significant problems
with the current co-array proposals, for example:

- the conceptual model is restricted to a small class of parallel
   machines
- the I/O model is overly complicated
- the synchronization model is overly complicated and too low-level
- significant further technical work on the proposal is still needed
   so there is a serious risk of delaying the whole revision schedule
- the co-array model is presented as the normal execution model with
   single processors as the exception; this is the wrong emphasis given
   that much of the new language is irrelevant to most users
- the proposals as currently formulated are large and experimental and
   should be evaluated in practice before being standardized

We believe the facts that co-arrays are of minority interest and that
these proposals in detail are untested in practice point strongly to
their being an optional, rather than a mandatory, part of the Fortran
standard.  We believe that the best way to do this would be for
co-arrays to appear as a Technical Report (without necessarily
guaranteeing inclusion in the next standard).  This would allow those
vendors whose primary markets are for single processors to avoid the
burden of implementing features of little interest to their customers.
We urge J3 to proceed on these lines and to so recommend to WG5.
