INTRODUCTION
This is a separate part of the standard that defines a conditional
compilation language.  References to Part 1 refer to the Fortran 95
standard.

The rest of the introduction to be completed for electronic distribution.

RATIONALE
Conditional compilation is a programming language feature which permits
selected blocks of code to be ignored by the processor.  There are many
uses for conditional compilation.  Writing portable code is one of the
popular uses of conditional compilation.

The rest of the rationale to be completed for electronic distribution.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

THE CONDITIONAL COMPILATION LANGUAGE DEFINITION

   Section 1  Conditional Compilation

The conditional compilation language definition for Fortran consists of
nine directives and three options.  When used together, the conditional
compilation directives and options offer the power to select blocks of
code for compilation without modifying the source text.

   Section 2  High level syntax

This section introduces the terms associated with the conditional
compilation (CoCo) program.  (For brevity, throughout this text the
term conditional compilation is appreviated as CoCo.  We may decide
to use CC or the full spelling before the final draft.)

A Fortran statement is considered a CoCo-comment.

  R201    CoCo-program     is    CoCo-directive
                                 [ CoCo-directive ] ...

  R202    CoCo-directive   is    CoCo-type-decl-directive
                           or    CoCo-executable-construct
                           or    INCLUDE line
                           or    CoCo-comment

  R203    CoCo-executable-construct    is     CoCo-action-directive
                                       or      CoCo-if-construct

  R204    CoCo-action-directive         is CoCo-assignment-directive
                                        or  CoCo-error-directive

   Section 3  Constants, source form and including text

        3.1  CoCo constants

  R301    CoCo-constant            is  CoCo-literal-constant
                                   or  CoCo-named-constant

  R302    CoCo-literal-constant    is   CoCo-int-literal-constant
                                   or  CoCo-logical-literal-constant

  R303    CoCo-int-literal-constant        is      digit-string

  R304    CoCo-logical-literal-constant    is      .TRUE.
                                           or      .FALSE. 

  R305    CoCo-char-literal-constant       is      ' [ rep-char ] ...  '
                                           or      " [ rep-char ] ...  "

  R306    CoCo-named-constant      is   name

        3.2  CoCo source form

A CoCo program is a sequence of one or more lines, organized as CoCo 
directives, CoCo comments and INCLUDE lines.  A CoCo directive is a
sequence of one or more complete or partial lines.  A line is a
sequence of zero or more characters.

A CoCo character context means characters within a CoCo character
literal constant (R305).

A CoCo comment may contain any character that may occur in any
CoCo character context.

In CoCo source form, each source line may contain from zero to
132 characters and there are restrictions on where a CoCo
directive (or portion of a CoCo directive) may appear within a line.
However, if a line contains any character that is not of default
kind (part1:4.3.2.1), the number of characters allowed on the line
is processor dependent.

In CoCo source form, blank characters shall not appear within CoCo
lexical tokens other than in a CoCo character context.  Blanks may
be inserted freely between CoCo tokens to improve readability.  A
sequence of blank characters outside of a CoCo character context is
equivalent to a single blank character.

A blank shall be used to separate CoCo names, or CoCo constants from
adjacent keywords, CoCo names, or CoCo constants.

        3.2.1  CoCo directive and comment start

  R307    CoCo-dir-start      is      ??

  R308    CoCo-comment-start        is      ?>
                                    or      ?*

Constraint:  The characters "??", "?>" or "?*" shall be in
character positions 1 and 2 of the source line.

        3.2.2  CoCo commentary

A line that is not a CoCo directive or a partial CoCo directive is
called a CoCo comment line.  Within a CoCo directive, the character
"!" in any character position initiates a CoCo comment except when 
it appears within a CoCo character context.  The comment extends to
the end of the source line.  If the first nonblank character on a
line after character position 2 is an "!", the line is also a CoCo
comment line.  Lines containing only blanks after character position
2 or containing no characters after character position 2 are also
CoCo comment lines.  Lines with the CoCo-comment-start in character
positions 1 and 2 are also CoCo comment lines.

 Note 3.1
 Examples of CoCo comment lines are:

 gender = GetRabbitGender(a_rabbit) ! a Fortran statement?
 ! a Fortran comment
 ?? ! set "system" to "system_A"
 ??
 ?>       OPEN(UNIT=6, FILE="system.dependent.name")
 ?*     OPEN(UNIT=6, FILE="sysdpnt.nam")
 ENDNote 3.1

        3.2.3  CoCo directive continuation

The character "&" is used to indicate that the current CoCo directive
is continued on the next line.  CoCo comment lines shall not be
continued; an "&" in a CoCo comment has no effect.  When used for
continuation, the "&" is not part of the CoCo directive.  No line
shall contain a single "&" as the only nonblank character after
character position 2 in a CoCo-noncomment line or as the only
nonblank character before an "!" that initiates a comment.

        3.2.3.1  CoCo-noncharacter context continuation

If an "&" not in a CoCo comment is the last nonblank character on a
line or the last nonblank character before an "!" that initiates a
comment, the CoCo directive is continued on the next line.  If the
first nonblank character after character position 2 on the next
CoCo-noncomment line is an "&", the CoCo directive continues at the
next character following the "&"; otherwise, it continues with the
first character position after character position 2 of the next
CoCo-noncomment line.

If a CoCo lexical token is split across the end of a line, the first
nonblank character after character position 2 on the first following
CoCo-noncomment line shall be an "&" immediately followed by the
successive characters of the split token. 

 Note 3.2
 An example of CoCo-noncharacter context continuation is:

 ?? LOGICAL :: too_good&
 ??&_to_be_&
 ??&true =           &
 ??           .FALSE.  ! These four lines contain 1 CoCo directive
 ENDNote 3.2

        3.2.3.2  CoCo character context continuation

If a CoCo character context is to be continued, the "&" shall be the
last nonblank character on the line and shall not be followed by CoCo
commentary.  An "&" shall be the first nonblank character after
character position 2 on the next line and the CoCo directive continues
with the next character following the "&". 

 Note 3.3
 An example of CoCo character context continuation is:

 ?? error *, "de&
 ??             &f&
 ??              &inately choosing Fortran" ! 3 lines, 1 CoCo directive
 ENDNote 3.3

        3.2.4  CoCo directives

A CoCo directive shall contain the characters "??" in character 
positions 1 and 2.  

A CoCo directive shall not have more than 39 continuation lines.

 Note 3.4
 Examples of CoCo directives are:

 ?? INTEGER, PARAMETER :: system_A = 1
 ?? ERROR *, "system_A = ", system_A
 ??   IF (.FALSE.) THEN
 ??   endif
 ENDNote 3.4

        3.3  Including source text  

Additional text may be incorporated into the source text of a
CoCo program during processing.  This is accomplished with the
INCLUDE line, which has the form

	INCLUDE char-literal-constant  

The INCLUDE line is specified in part 1, section 3.4 of this standard.

An INCLUDE line in a CoCo FALSE block (6.2.2) is not expanded.
The CoCo directives that are part of a CoCo IF construct (6.2)
shall not be split across included source text.

   Section 4  CoCo type declaration directives

  R401    CoCo-type-declaration-directive   is      

  CoCo-dir-start CoCo-type-spec [ , PARAMETER ] :: CoCo-entity-decl-list 

  R402    CoCo-type-spec       is      INTEGER
                               or      LOGICAL

  R403    CoCo-entity-decl     is

   CoCo-object-name [ CoCo-initialization ]

Constraint:  A CoCo-object-name shall not be the same as any
other CoCo-object-name.

  R404    CoCo-initialization  is      = CoCo-initialization-expr

CoCo-initialization-expr is defined in R512.

 Note 4.1
 Examples of CoCo type declaration directives are:

 ?? integer, parameter :: F77 = 1, F90 = 2, F95 = 3
 ?? integer :: fortran_level = F90
 ?? logical :: debug_procedure_entry_exit
 ENDNote 4.1

   Section 5  CoCo variables, expressions and assignment directive

        5.1   CoCo variables

  R501    CoCo-variable        is      CoCo-scalar-variable-name

Constraint:  CoCo-scalar-variable-name shall not have the
PARAMETER attribute.

Constraint:  CoCo-scalar-variable-name shall appear as an
object-name in a CoCo-type-declaration-directive before appearing
elsewhere in a CoCo program.

        5.2  CoCo expressions

        5.2.1  CoCo primary

  R502    CoCo-primary  is      CoCo-constant
                        or      CoCo-variable
                        or      ( CoCo-expr )

Constraint:  A CoCo-variable shall be defined (8.2) before
appearing as a CoCo-primary.

        5.2.2  Level-1 expressions

  R503    CoCo-add-operand     is

   [ CoCo-add-operand mult-op ] primary

  R504    CoCo-level-1-expr    is

   [ [ CoCo-level-1-expr ] add-op ] CoCo-add-operand
        5.2.3  Level-2 expressions

  R505    CoCo-level-2-expr    is

   [ CoCo-level-1-expr rel-op ] CoCo-level-1-expr

        5.2.4  Level-3 expressions

  R506    CoCo-and-operand     is

   [ not-op ] CoCo-level-2-expr

  R507    CoCo-or-operand      is

   [ CoCo-or-operand and-op ] CoCo-and-operand

  R508    CoCo-equiv-operand   is

   [ CoCo-equiv-operand or-op ] CoCo-or-operand

  R509    CoCo-level-3-expr    is

   [ CoCo-level-3-expr equiv-op ] CoCo-equiv-operand

        5.2.5  General form of a CoCo expression

  R510    CoCo-expr    is      CoCo-level-3-expr

        5.3  Data type of a CoCo expression

The data type of a CoCo expression is either Integer or Logical.

  R511    CoCo-logical-expr    is     CoCo-expr

Constraint:  CoCo-logical-expr shall be type logical.

        5.4  CoCo initialization expression

  R512    CoCo-initialization-expr     is      CoCo-expr

Constraint:  A CoCo-initialization-expr shall be an
initialization expression (need forward reference to Part 1.)

The one place in the CoCo language where an intialization
expression is used is the CoCo type declaration directives.

        5.5  CoCo assignment directive

A CoCo variable may be defined or redefined by execution of
a CoCo assignment directive.

  R513    CoCo-assignment-directive is

   CoCo-dir-start CoCo-variable = CoCo-expr
where CoCo-variable is defined in R501 and CoCo-expr is
defined in R510.

In a CoCo assignment directive, the types of CoCo-variable
and CoCo-expr shall either both be integer or both be logical.

 Note 5.1
 Examples of CoCo assignment directives are:

 ?? debug_level = debug_level ÿ2D 1
 ?? is_company_x_machine = (system == sysE) .OR. (system == sysF)
 ??    project_level = foo_version ÿ2D latest_release
 ENDNote 5.1

   Section 6  CoCo execution control and conditional compilation

The execution sequence and conditional compilation are
controlled by CoCo if constructs.

 Note 6.1
 A CoCo program is not required to contain any CoCo if constructs,
 CoCo error directives or INCLUDE lines.  Execution of such a CoCo
 program has no effect.
 END Note 6.1

        6.1  CoCo blocks

A CoCo block is a sequence of CoCo directives that are treated
as a unit.

  R601    CoCo-block   is      [ CoCo-directive ] ...

CoCo executable constructs may be used to control which CoCo blocks
of a CoCo program are executed.  

        6.2  CoCo IF construct

The CoCo IF construct selects for execution no more than one of its
constituent CoCo blocks.  This CoCo block is called the CoCo TRUE
block.  The remainder of the CoCo blocks in a CoCo IF construct, if
any, are selected to be ignored by the processor.  These CoCo blocks
are called CoCo FALSE blocks.

        6.2.1  Form of the CoCo IF construct

  R602    CoCo-if-construct    is      CoCo-if-then-directive

                                            CoCo-block

                                     [ CoCo-else-if-directive

                                            CoCo-block ] ...

                                     [ CoCo-else-directive

                                            CoCo-block ]

                                     CoCo-end-if-directive

  R603    CoCo-if-then-directive    is    

   CoCo-dir-start IF ( CoCo-scalar-logical-expr ) THEN

  R604    CoCo-else-if-directive    is    

   CoCo-dir-start ELSE IF ( CoCo-scalar-logical-expr ) THEN 

  R605    CoCo-else-directive       is    CoCo-dir-start ELSE 

  R606    CoCo-end-if-directive     is    CoCo-dir-start END IF

 Note 6.2
 An example of two CoCo if constructs (one nested within the
 other) is:

 ?? if (is_company_x_machine) then 
 ??  if (fortran_level == F95) then
	 pure function GetRabbitWeight(a_rabbit) result(weight)
	  type (rabbit), intent(in) :: a_rabbit
 ??  elseif (fortran_level == F90) THEN
	 function GetRabbitWeight(a_rabbit) result(weight)
	  type (rabbit) :: a_rabbit
 ??  else 
 ??   ERROR *, "We do not have a FORTRAN 77 product from company X"
 ??  endif ! (fortran_level == ...
 ?? else
	 function GetRabbitWeight() result(weight)
	  ! Only have Fortran 90 derived types with company X, so
	  ! return a weight of 1 for now
 ?? endif ! (is_company_x_machine)  
 ENDNote 6.2

        6.2.2  Execution of an IF construct

At most one of the CoCo blocks in the CoCo IF construct is executed.
If there is a CoCo ELSE directive in the construct, exactly one of
the CoCo blocks in the construct will be executed.  The CoCo scalar
logical expressions are evaluated in the order of their appearance
in the construct until a true value is found or a CoCo ELSE directive
or CoCo END IF directive is encountered.  If a true value or a CoCo
ELSE directive is found, the CoCo block immediately following is
executed and this completes the execution of the construct.  The
CoCo scalar logical expressions in any remaining CoCo ELSE IF
directives of the CoCo IF construct are not evaluated.  If none of
the evaluated expressions is true and there is no CoCo ELSE directive,
the execution of the construct is completed without the execution of
any CoCo block within the construct.

Execution of a CoCo END IF directive has no effect. 

        6.2.2.1  Execution of a CoCo TRUE block

Source lines contained in a CoCo TRUE block are selected as
possible Fortran statements for the processor and are handled
according to the rules in Section 11.

        6.2.2.2  Execution of a CoCo FALSE block

Source lines contained in a CoCo FALSE block are selected as
lines to be ignored by the processor and are handled according to
the rules in Section 11.

   Section 7  CoCo error directive

  R701    CoCo-error-directive   is

   CoCo-dir-start ERROR *  [ , CoCo-output-item-list ]

  R702    CoCo-output-item     is      CoCo-expr
                               or      CoCo-char-literal-constant

Execution of a CoCo ERROR directive informs the processor that
an error has occurred during CoCo processing.

 Note 7.1
 Examples of the CoCo error directive are:

 ?? ERROR *, "system shall be set to 'sys1' or 'sys2'"
 ?? ERROR *, "system = ", system
 ?? ERROR *
 ENDNote 7.1

   Section 8  Scope and definition of CoCo variables

        8.1  Scope of CoCo variables

CoCo variables have the scope of the CoCo program in which they
are declared.

        8.2  Events that cause CoCo variables to become defined

CoCo variables become defined as follows:

(1)     Execution of a CoCo assignment directive causes the CoCo
variable that precedes the equals to become defined.

(2)     Execution of a CoCo initialization in a CoCo type
declaration directive causes the CoCo variable that precedes
the equals to become defined.

(3)     Execution of the CoCo-set-option (10.2) causes
the CoCo variable to become defined.

   Section 9  CoCo program conformance

        9.1  A conforming CoCo program

A CoCo program shall contain CoCo directives that abide by the
syntax and semantics rules previously described in this part of
the standard.  A processor shall accept CoCo
programs, CoCo options (Section 10), and be capable of creating the CoCo
file (Section 11).

        9.2  A nonconforming CoCo program

A processor shall have a mechanism to report a nonconforming
CoCo program (erroneous CoCo syntax or erroneous CoCo semantics).
In the case of a nonconforming CoCo program, it is processor
dependent whether or not the processor will recover and continue
with the CoCo program, ignore the rest of the CoCo program and
continue processing the Fortran source, or cease processing completely.
	
   Section 10  CoCo options

There are three CoCo options - the CoCo-on-option, the
CoCo-set-option, and the CoCo-file-option.  A processor shall supply
at least one method of recognizing CoCo options separate from the
CoCo program.  For example, the invocation line may be the chosen
method of communicating CoCo options to the processor.

 Note 10.1 
A second example would be a CoCo input file which could supply all
the values for the desired CoCo options.
 ENDNote 10.1

        10.1  The CoCo ON option
	
The CoCo-on-option is a method to specify whether or not the processor
is to recognize CoCo programs.

 Note 10.2
 Since it may be desirable to apply conditional compilation only
 for certain situations, the Fortran programmer is able to specify
 when the CoCo program is recognized by using the CoCo-on-option.
 For example, the CoCo program may only be recognized when moving
 a source program from one operating system to another operating
 system or when starting or ending debugging sessions.
 ENDNote 10.2

        10.2  The CoCo SET option

The CoCo-set-option is a method of either
 (1) documenting the value of a CoCo PARAMETER or
 (2) assigning an initial value to a CoCo variable (R501) or
 (3) overriding the initial value assigned to a CoCo variable in
     a CoCo initialization expression (R512)
without editing the CoCo program.

 Note 10.3
 Recall that a CoCo variable shall not have the PARAMETER attribute.
 ENDNote 10.3

  R1001   CoCo-set-option     is

   CoCo-set-option-variable=CoCo-set-option-literal-constant

  R1002   CoCo-set-option-variable   is  CoCo-variable

  R1003   CoCo-set-option-literal-constant is CoCo-literal-constant

Constraint:  The CoCo-set-option-variable must be a CoCo variable
declared in the CoCo type declaration directive.

Constraint:  The type of the CoCo-set-option-variable
shall match the type of the CoCo-set-option-literal-constant.

Constraint:  If the CoCo-set-option-variable has the PARAMETER
attribute, the value of the CoCo-set-option-literal-constant
shall match the value supplied in the CoCo type declaration directive.

Constaint:  If the CoCo-set-option-variable appears in the CoCo
program as the CoCo variable in a CoCo assignment directive, it
shall appear at least once in a previous CoCo executable construct.

The CoCo-set-option minimally consists of a CoCo-set-option-variable
and a CoCo-set-option-literal-constant.  A processor may supply
additional representations for the CoCo logical literal constant;
for example, the characters 'T' or 'F' could be used to represent
.TRUE. or .FALSE. respectively.  In this case it is as if .TRUE.
or .FALSE. were specified as the CoCo-set-option-literal-constant.

The CoCo-set-option acts as if a CoCo assignment directive (R513)--
which consists of the CoCo-set-option-variable as the CoCo variable
and the CoCo-set-option-literal-constant as the CoCo expression
(R510)--were placed immediately following the CoCo type declaration
directive that declared the CoCo-set-option-variable.

 Note 10.4
 The value assigned to a CoCo variable with the CoCo-set-option shall
 not override the value assigned to a CoCo variable with the CoCo
 assignment directive.
 ENDNote 10.4

The CoCo-set-option may or may not appear if the CoCo-on-option
specifies that the CoCo program is to be recognized by the processor.

        10.3  The CoCo FILE option

The CoCo file (Section 11) may be created as output from CoCo in order
to show exactly which blocks of code, if any, are selected to be
ignored by the processor based on the conditional compilation
specified with CoCo if constructs.

There are different sorts of the CoCo file; each serves to feed a
different personal style of Fortran source input or different uses
of conditional compilation.  The CoCo-file-option is a method of
specifying which sort of the CoCo file is desired.

The CoCo-file-option minimally consists of a method to specify which
sort of the CoCo file is to be generated by the CoCo program--either
the CoCo-short-file (11.2), the CoCo-expand-file (11.3), the
CoCo-shift-file (11.4), or the CoCo-overwrite-file (11.5).  Whether or
not the name of the CoCo file may be specified in the CoCo-file-option
is processor defined.

 Note 10.5
 The CoCo file need not be generated in order to achieve conditional
 compilation as executing the CoCo program may result in direct
 communication to the processor as to which blocks of source text are
 to be ignore.
 ENDNote 10.5

If the CoCo-file-option specifies the CoCo-shift-file as the sort of
CoCo file, the CoCo program shall not contain a CoCo-overwrite-
comment-line (11.1.3) within a CoCo if construct (R602).
If the CoCo-file-option specifies the CoCo-overwrite-file as the
sort of CoCo file, the CoCo program shall not contain a CoCo-shift-
comment-line (11.1.1) within a CoCo if construct.  If the
CoCo-file-option specifies the CoCo-short-file as the sort of CoCo file,
the CoCo program shall not contain both CoCo-shift-comment-lines and  
CoCo-overwrite-comment-lines within the CoCo if constructs. 

A processor may require that the CoCo-file-option appear if the
CoCo-on-option specifies that the CoCo program is to be recognized
by the processor.

   Section 11  The CoCo file

The CoCo file may be created by the execution of CoCo programs.
There are three sorts of the CoCo file - the CoCo-short-file,
the CoCo-shift-file and the CoCo-overwrite-file.  Creating the
CoCo file requires recognizing four forms of a CoCo comment
line (3.2.2) - the CoCo-shift-comment-line, the
CoCo-unshift-comment-line, the CoCo-overwrite-comment-line, and the
CoCo-unoverwrite-comment-line.

 Note 11.1
 By creating either the CoCo-shift-file or the CoCo-overwrite-file,
 it is possible to replace the input source with the CoCo file without 
 losing information.
 ENDNote 11.1

        11.1  CoCo comment lines

CoCo comment lines are all source lines that are not CoCo directives
or partial CoCo directives.  Execution of an CoCo if construct in
CoCo programs requires the recognition of two forms of CoCo comment
lines -- CoCo shift comment lines and CoCo overwrite comment lines.
CoCo comment lines that are CoCo shift comment lines or CoCo overwrite
comment lines may be modified by the execution of CoCo TRUE blocks and
CoCo FALSE blocks.

        11.1.1  CoCo shift comment lines

The CoCo-shift-comment-line is a CoCo comment line that has the
characters "?>" in character positions 1 and 2

A CoCo comment line that is not a CoCo-shift-comment-line becomes a 
CoCo-shift-comment-line by shifting its contents 2 character
positions to the right and placing the characters "?>" in character
positions 1 and 2.  If a CoCo comment line becomes a CoCo-shift-
comment-line, the length of the CoCo-shift-comment-line shall be
equal to two plus the length of the CoCo comment line.  The length
of the CoCo-shift-comment-line, not including trailing blanks, shall
be less than or equal to 132.

 Note 11.2
 For example, these two lines are CoCo comment lines that are not CoCo 
 shift comment lines:         
  
     !234567890123456789012345678
       line_len = 23 .OR. 28

 These two lines, turned into CoCo shift comment lines, would become:

     ?>!234567890123456789012345678
     ?>  line_len = 23 .OR. 28

 ENDNote 11.2

        11.1.2  CoCo unshift comment lines

The CoCo-unshift-comment-line is a CoCo shift comment line that
has been shifted to the left 2 character positions.  The length
of the CoCo-unshift-comment-line is equal to the length of the
CoCo shift comment line minus two.

 Note 11.3
 For example, these two lines are CoCo shift comment lines:        
  
     ?>!234567890123456789012345678
     ?>  line_len = 23 .OR. 28

 These two lines, turned into CoCo unshift comment lines, would become:

     !234567890123456789012345678
       line_len = 23 .OR. 28

 ENDNote 11.3
		     
        11.1.3  CoCo overwrite comment lines

The CoCo-overwrite-comment-line is a CoCo comment line that has
the characters "?*" in character positions 1 and 2.

A CoCo comment line that is not a CoCo-overwrite-comment-line
becomes a CoCo-overwrite-comment-line by replacing the characters
in character positions 1 and 2 with the characters "?*".  The
replaced characters shall be "  " (two blanks).

 Note 11.4
 For example, these two lines are CoCo comment lines that are not CoCo 
 overwrite comment lines (each lines starts with 2 blanks):

	  !78901234567890123456
	  line_len = 18
 These two lines, turned into CoCo overwrite comment lines, would become:

     ?*!78901234567890123456
     ?*line_len = 18

 ENDNote 11.4

        11.1.4  CoCo unoverwrite comment lines

The CoCo-unoverwrite-comment-line is a CoCo overwrite comment line
that has replaced the characters "?*" in character positions 1 and 2
with the characters "  " (two blanks).  The length of the
CoCo-unoverwrite-comment-line is equal to the length of the CoCo
overwrite comment line.

 Note 11.5
 For example, these two lines are CoCo overwrite comment lines:        
  
     ?*!78901234567890123456
     ?*line_len = 18

 These two lines, turned into CoCo unoverwrite comment lines, would become
 (each lines starts with 2 blanks):

	  !78901234567890123456
	  line_len = 18

 ENDNote 11.5

        11.2  The CoCo short file

The CoCo-short-file shall consist of all the CoCo comment lines,
possibly modified, in the order in which they appear in the CoCo
program except those that are in a CoCo FALSE block.  There are
no CoCo directive lines in the CoCo-short-file.  The CoCo-short-file
shall have at most the same number of lines as the source text.
Included source text from any INCLUDE lines is not expanded in
the CoCo-short-file.

Execution of a CoCo TRUE block changes each CoCo shift comment line
contained in the CoCo TRUE block to a CoCo-unshift-comment-line in
the CoCo-short-file according to 11.1.2.

Execution of a CoCo TRUE block changes each CoCo overwrite comment
line contained in the CoCo TRUE block to a CoCo-unoverwrite-
comment-line in the CoCo-short-file according to 11.1.4.

 Note 11.6
 For example, consider the following CoCo program:
  
     ?? integer, parameter :: vendorA = 1, vendorB = 2
     ?? integer :: using_vendor = vendorA
     ?? if (using_vendor == vendorA) then
	   INTEGER, PARAMETER :: FOUR_BYTE_INT = 1
     ?? elseif (using_vendor == vendorB) then
	   INTEGER, PARAMETER :: FOUR_BYTE_INT = 4
     ?? else  ! error with the value of using_vendor on CoCo-set-option
     ??  error *, "CoCo variable 'using_vendor' shall be set to 1 or 2"
     ??  error *, "Set 'using_vendor' correctly on the CoCo-set-option"
     ?? endif
	   
	   INTEGER (KIND=FOUR_BYTE_INT) :: ACCOUNT_NUMBER

 If the CoCo-file-option specifies the CoCo-short-file and the
 CoCo-set-option is not specified, the following CoCo short file
 would be created by executing the above CoCo program.

	   INTEGER, PARAMETER :: FOUR_BYTE_INT = 1
	   
	   INTEGER (KIND=FOUR_BYTE_INT) :: ACCOUNT_NUMBER

 ENDNote 11.6

        11.3  The CoCo expand file

The CoCo-expand-file differs from the CoCo-short-file only by
expanding any included source text from any INCLUDE lines.
The INCLUDE line is replaced with the included source text.

        11.4  The CoCo shift file

The CoCo-shift-file shall consist of all the CoCo comment lines,
possibly modified, and all the CoCo directive lines in the order
in which they appear in the CoCo program.  The CoCo-shift-file
shall have the same number of lines as the source text.
Included source text from any INCLUDE lines is not expanded in
the CoCo-shift-file.

Execution of a CoCo FALSE block changes each CoCo comment line
that is not a CoCo shift comment line contained in the CoCo FALSE
block to a CoCo shift comment line in the CoCo-shift-file according
to 11.1.1.

A processor shall not change a CoCo shift comment line that appears
in a CoCo FALSE block. 

Execution of a CoCo TRUE block changes each CoCo shift comment line
contained in the CoCo TRUE block to a CoCo unshift comment line in
the CoCo-shift-file according to 11.1.2.

 Note 11.7
 For example, consider the following CoCo program:
  
     ?? integer, parameter :: vendorA = 1, vendorB = 2
     ?? integer :: using_vendor = vendorA
     ?? if (using_vendor == vendorA) then
	   INTEGER, PARAMETER :: FOUR_BYTE_INT = 1
     ?? elseif (using_vendor == vendorB) then
     ?>      INTEGER, PARAMETER :: FOUR_BYTE_INT = 4
     ?? else  ! error with the value of using_vendor on CoCo-set-option
     ??  error *, "CoCo variable 'using_vendor' shall be set to 1 or 2"
     ??  error *, "Set 'using_vendor' correctly on the CoCo-set-option"
     ?? endif
	   
	   INTEGER (KIND=FOUR_BYTE_INT) :: ACCOUNT_NUMBER

 If the CoCo-file-option specifies the CoCo-shift-file and the
 CoCo-set-option specifies that the value of CoCo variable
 "using_vendor" shall be "vendorB",  the following CoCo shift
 file would be created by executing the above CoCo program.

     ?? integer, parameter :: vendorA = 1, vendorB = 2
     ?? integer :: using_vendor = vendorA
     ?? if (using_vendor == vendorA) then
     ?>      INTEGER, PARAMETER :: FOUR_BYTE_INT = 1
     ?? elseif (using_vendor == vendorB) then
	   INTEGER, PARAMETER :: FOUR_BYTE_INT = 4
     ?? else  ! error with the value of using_vendor on CoCo-set-option
     ??  error *, "CoCo variable 'using_vendor' shall be set to 1 or 2"
     ??  error *, "Set 'using_vendor' correctly on the CoCo-set-option"
     ?? endif
	   
	   INTEGER (KIND=FOUR_BYTE_INT) :: ACCOUNT_NUMBER

 ENDNote 11.7

        11.5  The CoCo overwrite file

The CoCo-overwrite-file shall consist of all the CoCo comment
lines, possibly modified, and all the CoCo directive lines in
the order in which they appear in the CoCo program.  The
CoCo-overwrite-file shall have the same number of lines as the
source text.  Included source text from any INCLUDE lines is not
expanded in the CoCo-overwrite-file.

Execution of a CoCo FALSE block changes each CoCo comment line
that is not a CoCo overwrite comment line contained in the CoCo
FALSE block to a CoCo overwrite comment line in the
CoCo-overwrite-file according to 11.1.3.

A processor shall not change a CoCo overwrite comment line that
appears in a CoCo FALSE block. 

Execution of a CoCo TRUE block changes each CoCo overwrite
comment line contained in the CoCo TRUE block to a CoCo
unoverwrite comment line in the CoCo-overwrite-file according
to 11.1.4.

 Note 11.8
 For example, consider the following CoCo program:
  
     ?? integer, parameter :: vendorA = 1, vendorB = 2
     ?? integer :: using_vendor = vendorA
     ?? if (using_vendor == vendorA) then
     ?* INTEGER, PARAMETER :: FOUR_BYTE_INT = 1
     ?? elseif (using_vendor == vendorB) then
	   INTEGER, PARAMETER :: FOUR_BYTE_INT = 4
     ?? else  ! error with the value of using_vendor on CoCo-set-option
     ??  error *, "CoCo variable 'using_vendor' shall be set to 1 or 2"
     ??  error *, "Set 'using_vendor' correctly on the CoCo-set-option"
     ?? endif
	   
	   INTEGER (KIND=FOUR_BYTE_INT) :: ACCOUNT_NUMBER

 If the CoCo-file-option specifies the CoCo-overwrite-file and the 
 CoCo-set-option is not specified, the following CoCo overwrite file 
 would be created by executing the above CoCo program.

     ?? integer, parameter :: vendorA = 1, vendorB = 2
     ?? integer :: using_vendor = vendorA
     ?? if (using_vendor == vendorA) then
	   INTEGER, PARAMETER :: FOUR_BYTE_INT = 1
     ?? elseif (using_vendor == vendorB) then
     ?* INTEGER, PARAMETER :: FOUR_BYTE_INT = 4
     ?? else  ! error with the value of using_vendor on CoCo-set-option
     ??  error *, "CoCo variable 'using_vendor' shall be set to 1 or 2"
     ??  error *, "Set 'using_vendor' correctly on the CoCo-set-option"
     ?? endif
	   
	   INTEGER (KIND=FOUR_BYTE_INT) :: ACCOUNT_NUMBER

 ENDNote 11.8

        11.6   Replacing the input file with the CoCo file

The above definitions of CoCo shift comment lines, CoCo overwrite
comment lines, the CoCo shift file, and the CoCo overwrite file
permits replacing the input source file with the CoCo file.
Replacing the input source file with the CoCo short file, however,
would result in deleting the CoCo program and possibly CoCo comment lines.

 Note 11.9
 For example, consider the CoCo if construct:
  
     ?? if (using_vendor == vendorA) then
	   INTEGER, PARAMETER :: FOUR_BYTE_INT = 1
     ?? elseif (using_vendor == vendorB) then
	   INTEGER, PARAMETER :: FOUR_BYTE_INT = 4
     ?? else  ! error with the value of using_vendor on CoCo-set-option
     ??  error *, "CoCo variable 'using_vendor' shall be set to 1 or 2"
     ??  error *, "Set 'using_vendor' correctly on the CoCo-set-option"
     ?? endif
	   
 If the CoCo-file-option specifies the CoCo-overwrite-file and
 CoCo variable "using_vendor" is set to "vendorA", the following
 would appear in the CoCo overwrite file created by executing the
 above CoCo if construct.

     ?? if (using_vendor == vendorA) then
	   INTEGER, PARAMETER :: FOUR_BYTE_INT = 1
     ?? elseif (using_vendor == vendorB) then
     ?* INTEGER, PARAMETER :: FOUR_BYTE_INT = 4
     ?? else  ! error with the value of using_vendor on CoCo-set-option
     ??  error *, "CoCo variable 'using_vendor' shall be set to 1 or 2"
     ??  error *,"Set 'using_vendor' correctly on the CoCo-set-option"
     ?? endif

 If the CoCo-file-option specifies the CoCo-overwrite-file and
 CoCo variable "using_vendor" is set to "vendorB", the following
 would appear in the CoCo overwrite file created by executing the
 above CoCo if construct.

     ?? if (using_vendor == vendorA) then
     ?* INTEGER, PARAMETER :: FOUR_BYTE_INT = 1
     ?? elseif (using_vendor == vendorB) then
	   INTEGER, PARAMETER :: FOUR_BYTE_INT = 4
     ?? else  ! error with the value of using_vendor on CoCo-set-option
     ??  error *, "CoCo variable 'using_vendor' shall be set to 1 or 2"
     ??  error *, "Set 'using_vendor' correctly on the CoCo-set-option"
     ?? endif

 If the CoCo-file-option specifies the CoCo-overwrite-file and
 CoCo variable  "using_vendor" is set to the value 3, the contents
 of the CoCo overwrite file created by executing the above CoCo if
 construct is processor defined.
