Discussion
----------

We need an intrinsic whose effect is to cause the executing image to
become a failed image. This is needed for the testing of a program that
is intended to continue execution in the presence of failed images.


Edits to N1996:
---------------

[17:5] Before "TEAM_DEPTH" add "FAIL_IMAGE,".

[25:7+] After 7.4.13 add new subclause

7.4.13+ FAIL_IMAGE [(STRING)]

<<Description>> Make the executing become a failed image.

<<Class>> Subroutine.

<<Argument>>
STRING (optional) shall be of type character. It is an INTENT (IN)
argument. It it is present, its value is made available in a
processor-dependent manner.

If the processor has the ability to detect that an image has failed,
referencing this subroutine makes the executing image become a
failed image. Otherwise, a STOP statement is executed.

<<Example>> In a piece of code that each image executes about once a
second, invoking the subroutine
SUBROUTINE FAIL
   REAL :: X
   CALL RANDOM_NUMBER(X)
   IF(X<0.001) CALL FAIL_IMAGE
END SUBROUTINE FAIL
will randomly cause the executing image to become a failed image, on
average after about 1000 seconds.

NOTE 7.4
On a processor that does not have the ability to detect that an image
has failed, there is no reqirement that a STOP statement be executed
immediately. A processor that is particularly good at diagnostic
messages might provide a simulated failure environment that would
cause the call to appear to work as expected.

[32:1-] Before the entry for GET_TEAM in the table, add
"FAIL_IMAGE[(STRING)]  S  Make executing image become a failed image."

[33] In 8.11, add new bullet point:
"the manner in which the value of the STRING argument of the FAIL_IMAGE
intrinsic subroutine is made available."
