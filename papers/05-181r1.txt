1. Title: Parameterized module facility
   From: Van Snyder

2. Submitted By: J3

3. Status: Specification complete

4. References: 04-153, 04-383r1

5. Number: J3-014

6. Severity Level : 6

7. Basic Functionality:

  Provide a facility whereby a module or subprogram can be developed
  in a generic form, and then applied to any appropriate type.

8. Rationale:

  Many algorithms can be applied to more than one type.  Many
  algorithms that can only be applied to one type can be applied to
  more than one kind.  It is tedious, expensive, and error prone --
  especially during maintenance -- to develop algorithms that are
  identical except for type declarations to operate on different
  types or kinds.

  Generic modules are useful to package types together with their
  type-bound procedures, so that when they are instantiated, they are
  consistent.  This cannot be guaranteed for parameterized types.

9. Estimated Impact:

  Moderate to extensive, depending on how it's done.  The solution
  proposed here can be implemented mostly with changes in Section 11,
  and perhaps a few changes in Section 4.  Estimated at J3 meeting
  169 to be at 6 on the JKR scale.

10. Detailed Specification:

  Provide a variety of module called a "generic module".  A generic
  module is a template or pattern for generating specific instances.
  It has "generic parameters" but is otherwise structurally similar
  to a nongeneric module.  A generic parameter can be a type, a data
  object, a procedure, a generic interface, a nongeneric module, or a
  generic module.

  By substituting concrete values for its generic parameters, one can
  create an "instance of a generic module".  Entities from generic
  modules cannot be accessed by use association.  Rather, entities
  can be accessed from instances of them.  Instances of generic
  modules have all of the properties of nongeneric modules, except
  that they are always local entities of the scoping units in which
  they are instantiated.

  Provide a means to create instances of generic modules by
  substituting concrete values for their generic parameters

  Provide a means to access entities from instances of generic
  modules by use association.

  It is proposed at this time that generic modules do not have
  submodules.

  The varieties of entities allowed as generic parameters are:

     ---------------------------------------------------
     Generic parameter     Associated instance parameter
     ===================================================
     Type                  Type
     ---------------------------------------------------
     Data entity           Initialization expression
     ---------------------------------------------------

10.1 Definition of a generic module -- general principles

  A generic module is a global entity. 

  Instances do not access scoping units where they are instantiated
  by host association. The MODULE statement that introduces a generic
  module differs from one that introduces a nongeneric module by
  having a list of generic parameter names.

  The "interface" of a generic module is the list of the sets of
  characteristics of its generic parameters.  The interface shall be
  explicitly declared, that is, the variety of entity of each generic
  parameter, and the characteristics required of its associated
  actual parameter when an instance is created, shall be declared. 
  There shall be no optional parameters.  Generic parameters and
  their associated instance parameters are described in detail in
  section 10.3 below.

  Other than the appearance of generic parameters in the MODULE
  statement, and their declarations, generic modules are structurally
  similar to nongeneric modules, as defined by R1104:

  R1104 <module> <<is>>  <module-stmt>
                       [ <specification-part> ]
                       [ <module-subprogram-part> ]
                         <end-module-stmt>

  although it may be necessary to relax statement-ordering
  restrictions a little bit.

10.2 Instantiation of a generic module and use of the instance --
     general principles

  An instance of a generic module is created by the appearance of a
  USE statement that refers to that generic module, and provides
  concrete values for each of the generic module's generic
  parameters.   These concrete values are called "instance
  parameters".  The instance parameters in the USE statement
  correspond to the module's generic parameters either by position or
  by name, in the same way as for arguments in procedure references
  or component specifiers in structure constructors.

  The characteristics of each instance parameter shall be consistent
  with the corresponding generic parameter.

  By substituting the concrete values of instance parameters for
  corresponding generic parameters, an "instance" of a generic module
  is created, or "instantiated".  An instance of a generic module is
  a module, but it is a local entity of the scoping unit where it is
  instantiated.  It does not, however, access by host association the
  scoping unit where it is instantiated.

  Each local entity within an instance of a generic module is
  distinct from the corresponding entity in a different instance,
  even if both instances are instantiated with identical instance
  parameters.

  A generic module shall not be an instance parameter of an instance
  of itself, either directly or indirectly.

  A generic module may be instantiated and accessed in two ways:

    o By instantiating it and giving it a name, and then accessing
      entities from the named instance by use association.  Named
      instances are created by a USE statement of the form

        USE :: <named-instance-specification-list>

      where a <named-instance-specification> is of the form
      <instance-name> => <instance-specification>, and
      <instance-specification> is of the form
      <generic-module-name> ( <instance-parameter-list> ).

      In this case, the <only-list> and <rename-list> are not
      permitted -- since this does not access the created instance by
      use association.

      Entities are then accessed from those instances by USE
      statements that look like R1109:

      R1109 <use-stmt> <<is>> USE [ [ , <module-nature> ] :: ] \smudge
                     \smudge <module-name> [ , <rename-list> ]
                       <<or>> USE [ [ , <module-nature> ] :: ] \smudge
                     \smudge <module-name> , ONLY : [ <only-list> ]

      but with <module-name> replaced by <instance-name>.

    o By instantiating it without giving it a name, and accessing
      entities from that instance within the same statement.  In this
      case, the USE statement looks like <use-stmt>, but with
      <module-name> replaced by <instance-specification>.

  In either case, a <module-nature> could either be prohibited, or
  required with a new value such as GENERIC or INSTANCE.

  Alternatively, a new statement such as INSTANTIATE might be used
  instead of the above-described variations on the USE statement, at
  least in the named-instance case.  In the anonymous-instance case
  it would be desirable to use the USE statement, to preserve
  functionality of <rename-list> and <only-list> without needing to
  describe them all over again for a new statement.

10.3 Generic parameters and associated instance parameters

  A generic parameter may be a type or a data entity.

  Declarations of generic parameters may depend upon other generic
  parameters, but there shall not be a circular dependence between
  them, except by way of pointer or allocatable components of generic
  parameters that are types.

10.3.1 Generic parameters as types

  If a generic parameter is a type, it shall be declared by a type
  definition having the same syntax as a derived type definition. The
  type definition may include component definitions.  The types and
  type parameters of the components may themselves be specified by
  other generic parameters.  The type definition may include
  type-bound procedures.  Characteristics of these type-bound
  procedures may depend upon generic parameters.

  If the generic parameter is a type, the corresponding instance
  parameter shall be a type.  If the generic parameter has
  components, the instance parameter shall at least have components
  with the same names, types, type parameters and ranks.  If the
  generic parameter has type parameters, the instance parameter shall
  at least have type parameters with the same names and attributes. 
  Type parameters of the instance parameter that correspond to type
  parameters of the generic parameter shall be specified by a colon,
  as though they were deferred in an object of the type - even if
  they are KIND parameters, and any others shall have values given by
  initialization expressions.  If the generic parameter has
  type-bound specific procedures or type-bound generics, the
  corresponding instance parameter shall at least have type-bound
  specifics and generics that are consistent, except that if a
  specific procedure binding to the generic parameter has the
  ABSTRACT attribute the instance parameter need not have a specific
  binding of the same name because it is only used to provide an
  interface for a generic binding; it shall not be accessed within
  the generic module by the specific name.  Instance parameters that
  are intrinsic types shall be considered to be derived types with no
  accessible components.  Intrinsic operations and intrinsic
  functions are available in every scoping unit, so it is not
  necessary to assume that intrinsic operations and intrinsic
  functions are bound to the type.

10.3.2 Generic parameters as data objects

  If a generic parameter is a data object, it shall be declared by a
  type declaration statement.  Its type and type parameters may be
  generic parameters.  It is necessary that the actual parameter to
  be provided when the generic module is instantiated shall be an
  initialization expression, so the generic parameter shall have the
  KIND attribute, no matter what its type - even a type specified by
  another generic parameter.

10.4 Instantiation of a generic module and use of the instance - fine
     points

  Where a module is instantiated, the <only> and <renaming>
  facilities of the USE statement can be used as well.  Processors
  could exploit an <only-list> to avoid instantiating all of a module
  if only part of it is ultimately used.  Suppose for example that
  one has a generic BLAS module from which one wants only a double
  precision L2-norm routine.  One might write

    USE BLAS(kind(0.0d0)), only: DNRM2 => GNRM2

  where GNRM2 is the specific name of the L2-norm routine in the
  generic module, and DNRM2 is the local name of the double precision
  instance of it created by instantiating the module.  If <only> is
  not used, every entity in the module is instantiated, and all
  public entities are accessed from the instance by use association,
  exactly as is currently done for a USE statement without an
  <only-list>.

  If a named instance is created, access to it need not be in the
  same scoping unit as the instantiation; it is only necessary that
  the name of the instance be accessible.  Indeed, the instance might
  be created in one module, its name accessed from that module by use
  association, and entities from it finally accessed by use
  association by way of that accessed name.

10.5 Examples of proposed syntax for definition

  The following subsections illustrate how to define modules.

10.5.1 Sort module hoping for "<" routine

  Here's an example of the beginning of a generic sort module in
  which the processor can't check that there's an accessible "<"
  operator with an appropriate interface until the generic module is
  instantiated.  There's no requirement on the parameters of the
  generic type "MyType".  The only way the instance can get the "<"
  routine is if it is intrinsic or if it is bound to the type given
  by the instance parameter (recall that instances do not access by
  host association the scoping unit where they're instantiated). 
  Aleks advocates that this one is illegal.  The primary difference
  would be in the quality of message announced in the event "MyType"
  does not have a suitable "<" operator.

    module Sorting ( MyType )
      type :: MyType
      end type MyType
      ....

10.5.2 Sort module with "<" specified by module parameter generic
       interface

  The "<" operator is given by a generic parameter.  When the module
  is instantiated, a generic identifier for an interface with a
  specific consistent with the LESS shown here, shall be provided as
  an instance parameter.

    module SortingP ( MyType, Operator(<) )
      type :: MyType
      end type MyType
      interface operator (<)
        pure logical abstract function Less ( A, B )
        ! "less" is purely an abstraction
          type(myType), intent(in) :: A, B
        end function Less
      end interface
      ....

  The ABSTRACT attribute for the LESS function means that the
  associated instance parameter for OPERATOR(<) only needs to have a
  specific with the specified interface, but the name isn't required
  to be LESS.  Indeed, LESS can't be accessed by that name within
  "SortingP" or by use association from an instance of "SortingP".
  The instance parameter corresponding to OPERATOR(<) need not have
  the same generic identifier.  For example, if it's OPERATOR(>)
  (with the obvious semantics), the instantiated sort routine would
  sort into reverse order.

10.5.3 Sort module with "<" specified by type-bound generic interface

  This illustrates a generic parameter that is a type that is
  required to have a particular type-bound generic.  The type shall
  have a type-bound generic with a particular interface, but if
  entities are declared by reference to the name "MyType" or a local
  name for it after it is accessed from an instance, the specific
  type-bound procedure cannot be invoked by name; it can only be
  accessed by way of the type-bound generic. The ABSTRACT attribute,
  which is only allowed in the definitions of types that are generic
  parameters, does this.

    module SortingTBP ( MyType )
      type :: MyType
      contains
        procedure(less), abstract :: Less
        ! Can't do "foobar%less".
        ! "Less" is only a handle for the interface for the
        ! "operator(<)" generic
        generic operator(<) => Less
        ! Type shall have this generic operator
      end type MyType
      ! Same explicit interface for "less" as in previous example
    ....

10.5.4 Module with type having at least a specified component

    module LinkedLists ( MyType )
      type :: MyType
        type(myType), pointer :: Next! "next" component is required.
        ! Type is allowed to have other components, and TBPs.
      end type MyType
      ....

10.5.5 Module with type having separately-specified kind parameter

    module LinkedLists ( MyType, ItsKind )
      type :: MyType(itsKind)
        integer, kind :: itsKind
      end type MyType
      integer, kind :: ItsKind
    ....

10.5.6 BLAS definition used in instantiation examples in 10.7

    module BLAS ( KIND )
      integer, kind :: KIND
      interface NRM2; module procedure GNRM2; end interface NRM2
      ....
    contains
      pure real(kind) function GNRM2 ( Vec )
      ....

10.6 Examples of proposed syntax for instantiation

  The following subsections illustrate how to instantiate a generic
  module.

10.6.1 Instantiating a stand-alone generic module

  Instantiate a generic module BLAS with KIND(0.0d0) and access every
  public entity from the instance:

    use BLAS(kind(0.0d0))

  Instantiate a generic module BLAS with KIND(0.0d0) and access only
  the GNRM2 function from the instance:

    use BLAS(kind(0.0d0)), only: GNRM2

  Instantiate a generic module BLAS with KIND(0.0d0) and access only
  the GNRM2 function from the instance, with local name DNRM2:

    use BLAS(kind(0.0d0)), only: DNRM2 => GNRM2

10.6.2 Instantiate within a module, and then use from that module

  This is the way to get only one single-precision and only one
  double precision instance of BLAS; instantiating them wherever they
  are needed results in multiple instances.  This also illustrates
  two ways to make generic interfaces using specific procedures in
  generic modules.  The first one creates the generic interface from
  specific procedures accessed from the instances:

    module DBLAS
      use BLAS(kind(0.0d0))
    end module DBLAS

    module SBLAS
      use BLAS(kind(0.0e0))
    end module SBLAS

    module B
      use DBLAS, only: DNRM2 => GNRM2
      use SBLAS, only: SNRM2 => GNRM2
      interface NRM2
        module procedure DNRM2, SNRM2
      end interface
    end module B

  In the second one the generic module has the generic interface
  named NRM2 that includes the GNRM2 specific:

    module DBLAS
      use BLAS(kind(0.0d0))
    end module DBLAS

    module SBLAS
      use BLAS(kind(0.0e0))
    end module SBLAS

    module B
      use DBLAS, only: NRM2    ! Generic; GNRM2 specific not accessed
      use SBLAS, only: NRM2, & ! Generic
        &    SNRM2 => GNRM2    ! Specific
    end module B

10.6.3 Instantiate and access twice in one scoping unit, augmenting
       generic interface

    module B
      use BLAS(kind(0.0d0)), only: NRM2 ! Generic; GNRM2 specific
                                        ! not accessed
      use BLAS(kind(0.0e0)), only: NRM2, & ! Generic NRM2 grows here
        &                SNRM2 => GNRM2    ! Specific
    end module B

  The method in 10.6.2 above might be desirable so as not
  accidentally to have multiple identical instances of BLAS in
  different scoping units.

10.6.4 Instantiate and give the instance a name, then access from it

    ! Instantiate BLAS with kind(0.0d0) and call the instance DBLAS,
    ! which is a local entity.
    use :: DBLAS => BLAS(kind(0.0d0))
    ! Access GNRM2 from the instance DBLAS and call it DNRM2 here
    use DBLAS, only: DNRM2 => GNRM2

10.6.5 Instantiate two named instances in one module, then use one
       elsewhere

    module BlasInstances
      ! Instantiate instances but do not access from them
      ! by use association
      use :: DBLAS => BLAS(kind(0.0d0)), SBLAS => BLAS(kind(0.0d0))
    end module BlasInstances

    module NeedsSBlasNRM2
      use BlasInstances, only: SBLAS  ! gets the SBLAS instance module,
                                      ! not its contents
      use SBLAS, only: SNRM2 => GNRM2 ! Accesses GNRM2 from SBLAS,
                                      ! calling it SNRM2
    end module  NeedsSBlasNRM2

10.6.6 Instantiate sort module with generic interface instance
       parameter

    type :: OrderedType
      ...
    end type OrderedType

    interface operator (<)
      pure logical function Less ( A, B )
        type(orderedType), intent(in) :: A, B
      end function Less
    end interface

    ! Notice relaxed statement ordering.
    use SortingP(orderedType,operator(<)), &
        &  only: OrderedTypeQuicksort => Quicksort
    ....

10.6.7 Instantiate sort module with TBP Less

    use SortingTBP(real(kind(0.0d0))), &
        &  only: DoubleQuicksort => Quicksort

  Notice that this depends on "<" being a "type-bound generic" that
  is bound to the intrinsic double precision type.  Here's one with a
  user-defined type that has a user-defined type-bound "<" operator.

    type MyType
      ! My components here
    contains
      procedure :: MyLess => Less
      generic operator ( < ) => myLess
    end type MyType

    use SortingTBP(myType), only: MyTypeQuicksort => Quicksort

  The interface for LESS is given in 10.5.2. Notice that the USE
  statement comes _after_ the type definition and the TBP's function
  definition.  Relaxing statement ordering requirements in this way
  might not be necessary.

10.7 Example of consistent type and TBP

  This example illustrates how to create a type with type-and-kind
  consistent type-bound procedures, for any kind.  This cannot be
  guaranteed by using parameterized types.

    module SparseMatrices ( Kind )
      integer, kind :: Kind
      type Matrix
        ! Stuff to find nonzero elements...
        real(kind) :: Element
      contains
        procedure :: FrobeniusNorm
       ....
      end type
    contains
      subroutine FrobeniusNorm ( TheMatrix, TheNorm )
        type(matrix), intent(in) :: TheMatrix
        real(kind), intent(out) :: TheNorm
        ....
      end subroutine FrobeniusNorm
      ....
    end module SparseMatrices
    ....
    use SparseMatrices(selected_real_kind(28,300)), & ! Quad precision
    & only: QuadMatrix_T => Matrix, QuadFrobenius => Frobenius, &
    &       QuadKind => Kind
    ! Access instance parameter by way of generic parameter
    ....
    type(quadMatrix_t) :: QuadMatrix
    real(quadKind) :: TheNorm
    ....
    call quadFrobenius ( quadMatix, theNorm )
