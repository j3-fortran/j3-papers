From: Dan Nagle
Subject: Require reports of ignorance
Date: 2019-February-14


At 218, during discussion of 138r1, a desire was expressed to address
the issue of a too-long line having characters that are silently ignored.
This paper proposes to add a requirement that processors report whenever
characters at the end of a too-long line are ignored.

During research for this paper, an edit missing from 138r1 was noted;
it is addressed herein.  The missing edit should have removed
a distinction between default and non-default characters affecting
line length, which no longer applies.



Edits


{ 4.2 Conformance }

{ disallow silent ignorance of too-long a line }

[26:11+p2] add a new numbered bullet:
"(1+) it reports when a line or statement is longer than allowed
      by Clause 6, if the extra characters are not processed;"

{ portability requires notice of source form errors }




{ 6.3.2.1 Free form line length }

{ remove mooted sentence }

[49:14-15p1] remove the last sentence of the paragraph
"If a line contains any character that is not of default kind,
the maximum number of characters allowed on the line is
processor dependent."

{ no longer applicable }


{ end }
