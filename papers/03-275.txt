Subject: On Passing Intrinsic Subroutines As Actual Arguments


Can an intrinsic subroutine be passed as an actual argument?
The standard does not lay any requirements on intrinsic subroutines
in Chapter 13.  We should make sure that they follow the
same rules as intrinsic functions, to be consistent with 12.4.1.3
[271:15-19].


Proposed edits to the Fortran 2003 FCD:
--------------------------------------- 

[291:21] Change "intrinsic function" to "intrinsic procedure"

[291:22] Change "intrinsic function" to "intrinsic procedure"
