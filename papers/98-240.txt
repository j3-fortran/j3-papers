Type aliases
------------

Add the following subsection before [56:14], and renumber subsequent
subsections.

[[Begin subsection]]

4.6 Type aliases

Type aliasing provides a method of data abstraction.  A type alias statement
does not define a new data type in the way that a derived type declaration
does.  Instead, it defines a name that can be used to define entities of a
particular type, while hiding which type that is.

4.6.1 Type alias definition

R4??   <type-alias-stmt>  <<is>>  TYPEALIAS  ::  <type-alias-list>
R4??   <type-alias>       <<is>>  <type-alias-name>  =>  <type-spec>

Constraint:  A <type-alias-name> shall not be the same as the name of any
             intrinsic type defined in this standard nor the same as any
other
             accessible <type-alias-name> or derived type <type-name>.

Explicit or implicit declaration of an entity or component using a type
alias
name is identical to declaration using the <type-spec> for which it is an
alias.

[[Begin J3 note]]
Need to make sure that <type-alias-name>s are permitted in typed allocations
and array constructors.
[[End J3 note]]

[[Begin Note]]
For example, the following declarations for X, Y and S

     TYPEALIAS :: DOUBLECOMPLEX => COMPLEX(KIND(1.0D0)),      &
    &             NEWTYPE => TYPE(DERIVED)
     TYPE(DOUBLECOMPLEX) :: X, Y
     TYPE(NEWTYPE) :: S

are equivalent to the following declarations.

     COMPLEX(KIND(1.0D0)) :: X, Y
     TYPE(DERIVED) :: S
[[End Note]]

The type alias name can also be used as a structure constructor name, if it
is
an alias for a derived type.

[[End subsection]]

2.1 After [10:12], add to R207:
  "             <<or>> <type-alias-stmt>"

4.5.5 After [53:35], add to R444:
  "             <<or>> <type-alias-name>"

4.5.5 After [53:39], add:
  "Constraint:  <type-alias-name> shall be the name of an accessible type
                alias that is an alias for a derived type."

Allow type aliases in <type-spec>'s:
5.1 After [59:26], add:
  "             <<or>> TYPE ( <type-alias-name> )"

Allow type alias names to be use associated:
11.3.2 [224:27] after "derived types" add ", type aliases"

Make type aliases local entities of class (1):
14.1.2 [317:36] after "derived types" add ", type aliases"

Declaration of a <type-alias-name> prevents host association of anything
with
that name:
14.6.1.3 After [326:6], add:
  "   (13) A <type-alias-name> in a <type-alias-stmt>;"
and renumber subsequent entries in the list.

Derived types
-------------

Edits for the BIND(C) attribute in a derived type definition.

4.5 [38:33],
         after "that type."
         add   "If the definition of a derived type specifies BIND(C), the
                storage sequence is the same as that which would be required
                by the target C processor for interoperability for a C
struct
                type that interoperates with an object of this derived type
                (16.2.2)."

4.5.1 After [39:25], add to R425:
  "          <<or>> BIND(C)"

4.5.1 [39:36],
  change "SEQUENCE shall not"
  to     "neither SEQUENCE nor BIND(C) shall"

4.5.1 After [39:36], add:
  "Constraint:  If BIND(C) is present, neither SEQUENCE nor a
                <type-param-name-list> shall be present.
   Constraint:  If BIND(C) is present, all derived types specified in
component
                definitions shall have been specified with the BIND(C)
                <type-attr-spec>.
   Constraint:  CONTAINS shall not be present, if BIND(C) is present."

4.5.1 After [40:22], add:
  "Constraint:  Neither POINTER nor ALLOCATABLE shall appear in a
                <component-def-stmt>, if BIND(C) appeared on the
                <derived-type-stmt>.
   Constraint:  A <proc-component-def-stmt> shall not appear, if BIND(C)
                appeared on the <derived-type-stmt>."

Dummy data objects
------------------

After [72:23], add the following subsection:

[[Begin subsection]]
5.1.2.13 VALUE attribute

The <<VALUE attribute>> shall be specified only in the scoping unit of a
subprogram or an interface block that was specified with the BIND(C)
attribute,
and shall be specified only for dummy arguments.  The VALUE attribute
implies
the INTENT(IN) attribute.

[[Begin note]]
The name of the VALUE attribute is intended to be suggestive.  Although a
processor is not required to use "pass by value" an argument with the VALUE
attribute, that might be a possible implementation.  In particular, when the
VALUE attribute is specified for a dummy argument in a procedure or
subprogram
that has the BIND(C) attribute, the processor shall use the same argument
passing convention of the target C processor, which is often pass by value.
[[End note]]
[[End subsection]]

After [77:18], add the following subsection:

[[Begin subsection]]
5.3.12 VALUE statement

R5?? <value-stmt>  <<is>>  VALUE  [::]  <dummy-arg-name-list>

Constraint:  A <value-stmt> shall occur only in the <specification-part> of
a
             subprogram or an interface body (12.3.2.1).

The VALUE statement specifies the VALUE attribute (5.1.2.14) for a list of
objects.
[[End subsection]]

After [10:12], add:
  "             <<or>> <value-stmt>"

After [59:40], add:
  "             <<or>> VALUE"

After [60:19], after "INTENT"
               add   ", VALUE"

After [60:46], add
  "Constraint:  If the VALUE attribute is specified, the PARAMETER,
EXTERNAL,
                POINTER, ALLOCATABLE, DIMENSION, INTENT(INOUT) or
INTENT(OUT)
                attribute shall not be specified.
   Constraint:  If the VALUE attribute is specified for a dummy argument of
                type character, the length parameter shall be one, and shall
                not be an asterisk."

12.4.1.2 [241:29], after "has the TARGET attribute"
                   add   ", does not have the VALUE attribute"

12.4.1.2 [241:47+], add
  "If the dummy argument has the TARGET attribute and the VALUE attribute,
any
   pointers associated with the dummy argument become undefined when
execution
   of the procedure completes."

New Interoperability section
----------------------------

Add the following new Section (16).

[[Start new section]]
Section 16:  Interoperability with C

[[Need an introduction here]]

16.1 The ISO_C_TYPES intrinsic module

A processor shall provide the intrinsic module ISO_C_TYPES.  This module
shall
make accessible the following entities:  C_INT, C_SHORT, C_LONG,
C_LONG_LONG,
C_SIGNED_CHAR, C_FLOAT, C_DOUBLE, C_LONG_DOUBLE, C_COMPLEX,
C_DOUBLE_COMPLEX,
C_LONG_DOUBLE_COMPLEX, C_CHAR, C_PTR, C_LOC and C_NULLCHAR.  The ISO_C_TYPES
module shall not make accessible any other entity.

C_INT, C_SHORT, C_LONG, C_LONG_LONG, C_SIGNED_CHAR, C_FLOAT, C_DOUBLE,
C_LONG_DOUBLE, C_COMPLEX, C_DOUBLE_COMPLEX, C_LONG_DOUBLE_COMPLEX and C_CHAR
shall be named constants of type default integer.

The values of C_INT, C_SHORT, C_LONG, C_LONG_LONG and C_SIGNED_CHAR shall
each be a representation method for integers that exists on the processor or
shall be -1.

C_FLOAT, C_DOUBLE and C_LONG_DOUBLE shall each have a value that specifies
an
approximation method for the real type that exists on the processor or shall
have the value -1.  The values of C_COMPLEX, C_DOUBLE_COMPLEX, and
C_LONG_DOUBLE_COMPLEX shall be the same as the values of C_FLOAT, C_DOUBLE,
and
C_LONG_DOUBLE, respectively.

The value of C_CHAR shall specify a representation method for characters
that
exists on the processor or shall have the value -1.

C_NULLCHAR shall be a named constant of type character with a length
parameter
of one and kind parameter equal to the value of C_CHAR or equal to the
default
character kind if C_CHAR has the value -1.  The value of C_NULLCHAR shall be
the same as the null value of the C char type.

C_PTR shall be a derived type or a type alias name.

16.2 Interoperation between Fortran entities and C entities

A scalar entity or derived type component in the "Fortran type" column of
Table
16.1, that has a kind type parameter that has the same value as the named
constant made accessible from the ISO_C_TYPES module specified in the "Type
kind" column, is said to interoperate with scalars or structure components
of
C types that are compatible with the C types in the corresponding row of the
"C type" column.

        Table 16.1 Correspondence between Fortran types and kinds
                   and C types

[[Begin Note]]
   For example, a scalar object of type integer, with a kind parameter
   equal to the value of C_SHORT, interoperates with a scalar object of
   the C type short or of any C type derived (via typedef) from short.
[[End Note]]

[[Begin Note]]
   The C standard specifies that the representations for positive signed
   integers are the same as the representations for corresponding values
   of unsigned integers.  Because Fortran does not provide direct support
   for unsigned kinds of integers, there ISO_C_TYPES module does not make
   accessible named constants C_UNSIGNED_INT, C_UNSIGNED_SHORT,
   C_UNSIGNED_LONG, C_UNSIGNED_LONG_LONG or C_UNSIGNED_CHAR.  Instead a
   user can use the constants for the signed kinds of integers to access
   the unsigned kinds as well.  Note that this has the potentially
   surprising side-effect that a scalar of the C type unsigned char
   interoperates with scalars of type integer with a kind type parameter
   of C_SIGNED_CHAR.
[[End Note]]

16.2.1 Interoperation with C pointer types

A Fortran scalar entity or derived type component of type C_PTR
interoperates
with C scalars or structure components that are of any C pointer type.

[[Begin Note]]
Note that this requires the representation method for all C pointer types to
be
the same for the C processor, if it is to be the target of interoperability
of
a Fortran processor.  The C standard does not impose this requirement, so
this
may limit the ability of some processors to conform to Fortran 2000.
Whether
any C processors of interest actually take advantage of this needs to be
determined.
[[End Note]]

[[Begin Note]]
No facility for dereferencing of C pointers within Fortran is provided.
[[End Note]]

16.2.2 Interoperation with C struct types

A Fortran scalar object or derived type component of derived type is said to
interoperate with a C scalar object or component of a struct type,
if the derived type definition includes BIND(C) (4.5), the derived type and
the struct type have the same number of components, and components of the
derived type interoperate with the corresponding components of the struct
type.

A Fortran scalar object or derived type component of derived type cannot
interoperate with a C scalar object or component of a struct type
that contains a bit fields or an array of an incomplete type.

[[Begin note]]
For example, a C scalar object of type myctype interoperates with a Fortran
scalar object of type myftype.

    typedef struct {
      int m, n;
      float r;
    } myctype;
[[End note]]

[[Begin note]]
Note that the C standard requires the names and component names of two
struct
types to be the same in order for the types to be considered to be the same.
This is similar to Fortran's rule describing when sequence derived types are
considered to be the same type.  This rule is not following for the purposes
of determining whether a Fortran entity of derived type interopates with a
C entity of a struct type.
[[End note]]

[[Begin note]]
Note that a Fortran entity of derived type cannot interoperate with a C
entity of a union type.
[[End note]]

16.2.3 Interoperation with C array types

An explicit-shape or assumed-size array of rank one interoperates with a C
array if the element type of the C array is not an array type, an element of
the Fortran array interoperates with an element of the C array, and

   (i)  if the Fortran array is an explicit-shape array and the extent of
the
        one dimension of the array is the same as the size of the C array;
or
   (ii) if the Fortran array is an assumed-size array and the C array does
not
        specify a size or specifies a size of *.

An explicit-shape or assumed-size array of rank <r>, where <r> is greater
than
one, interoperates with a C array if a Fortran array of rank <r-1> whose
<i>th
dimension has the same extent as the <i+1>th dimension of the original
array,
the extent of the first dimension of the array of rank <r-1> is the same as
the
size of the C array, and the element type of the C array interoperates with
the
array of rank <r-1>.

[[Begin note]]
For example, the Fortran array A interoperates with the C array b.

   INTEGER :: A(18, 3:7, *)

   int b[][5][18]
[[End note]]

16.2.4 Interoperation with C functions

If C type is "pointer to <<n>>", the <<reference type>> is <<n>>.

A Fortran procedure interoperates with a C function if:

  o the procedure is declared with the BIND(C) attribute;
  o the results of the procedure and the C function interoperate, if the
    Fortran procedure is a function, or the result type of the C function is
    void, if the Fortran procedure is a subroutine;
  o the number of  dummy arguments of the Fortran procedure is equal to the
    number of formal parameters of the C function;
  o any dummy argument with the VALUE attribute interoperates with the
    corresponding formal parameter of the C function; and
  o any dummy argument without the VALUE attribute corresponds to a formal
    parameter of the C function that is of a pointer type, and the type of
the
    dummy argument interoperates with the reference type of the formal
    parameter.

The BIND(C) attribute shall not be specified for a subroutine or function if
it
it has asterisk dummy arguments.  The BIND(C) attribute shall not be
specified
for a subroutine or function if it requires an explicit interface, unless
the
procedure is defined by a Fortran subprogram.

[[Begin note]]
Note that the requirement that the Fortran procedure not require an explicit
interface prohibits dummy arguments from having the POINTER attribute,
having
the ALLOCATABLE attribute or being assumed-shape arrays.  It also prohibits
the Fortran procedure from being elemental or having an array result.
[[End note]]

[[Begin note]]
For example, the Fortran function FUNC interoperates with the C function
func.

    BIND(C) INTEGER(C_SHORT) FUNCTION FUNC(I, J, K, L, M)
      INTEGER(C_INT), VALUE :: I
      REAL(C_DOUBLE) :: J
      INTEGER(C_INT) :: K, L(10)
      TYPE(C_PTR), VALUE :: M
    END FUNCTION FUNC

    short func(int i; double *j; int *k; int l[10], void *m);
[[End note]]

[[Begin note]]
Note that a C pointer may correspond to a Fortran dummy argument of type
C_PTR,
or to a Fortran scalar that does not have the VALUE attribute.
[[End note]]
[[End new section]]

Make BIND(C) and VALUE characteristics
12.2, [230:5] After "elemental"
              add   ", whether it has the BIND(C) attribute"

12.2.2.1, [230:15] Before "and whether"
                   add    "whether it has the VALUE attribute (5.1.2.13),"

Handling of characters
----------------------

The following changes are needed to allow scalar characters of lengths other
than one to be associated with C arrays of char.

Edits:
  In 5.1.2.4.4 [69:38+]
     Add "(4) If the actual argument is of type default character and is a
              scalar that is not an array element or array element substring
              designator, the size of the dummy array is MAX(INT(l/e), 0),
              where e is the length of an element in the dummy character
array,
              and l is the length of the actual argument."

  In 12.4.1.2 [240:44-45]
     Change "or array element substring"
     to     "array element substring, or scalar"

  In 12.4.1.2 [240:46]
     After  "array"
     add    "or scalar"

  In 12.4.1.2 [242:2-3]
     Change "or a substring of such an element"
     to     "or a scalar of type default character".

  In 12.4.1.5 [243:30]
     Change "an array element substring designator"
     to     "a scalar of type default character"

  In 12.4.1.5 [243:39+]
     Add    "If the actual argument is of type default character and is a
             scalar that is not an array element or array element substring
             designator, the element sequence consists of the character
storage
             units of the actual argument."
