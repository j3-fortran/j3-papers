    Unresolved issue 124: 
    
        Replace [206:16 - 207:37] with:
    
        "An input/output statement shall not cause the value of any
	 established format specification to be modified.
         
         A recursive input/output statement shall not modify the value
	 of any internal unit except that a recursive WRITE statement
	 may modify the internal unit identified by that recursive
	 WRITE statement.
    
         The value of a specifier in an input/output or INQUIRE
	 statement shall not depend on any <<input-item>>,
	 <<io-implied-do>> variable, nor on the definition or
	 evaluation of any other specifier in the
	 <<io-control-spec-list>> or <<inquire-spec-list>> in that
	 statement.
    
         The value of any subscript or substring bound of a variable
	 that appears in a specifier in an input/output or INQUIRE
	 statement shall not depend on any <<input-item>>,
	 <<io-implied-do>> variable, nor on the definition or
	 evaluation of any other specifier in the
	 <<io-control-spec-list>> or <<inquire-spec-list>> in that
	 statement."
