This is a response to 06-344.

Q. [20:20] The first sentence does not include the newly added ability
   to perform pointer association via explicit initialization or default
   initialization.
A. Agreed.

EDIT. [20:20] Append to sentence
  "or pointer initialization (4.5.4.5 Default initialization for components,
   5.2.3 Initialization)"

Q. [78:13+4-5] Near the end of Note 4.67, the phrase "interoperable
   values" which I don't think is defined. Maybe "the types will be
   interoperable"?
A. Agreed

EDIT. [78:13+4-5] "values"->"types" twice.


Q. [55:4] Is "ultimate/direct component of a type" well-defined? We have
   subcomponents of an object, and ultimate/direct components of an object.
   How about of a type? This is important because we have used this phrase
   heavily, especially for co-arrays (see for example C616 at [117:13-14]).

A. No, it is not explicitly defined; you should not be using such a term.
   In particular, C616 is faulty.

EDIT. [117:13-14] "be of a type that has" -> "have".

COMMENT. Please point out any other places for similar repair.
