Discussion:

Background information on lock variables is contained in paper
09-142. UTI 161 discusses the LOCK_TYPE subclause 13.8.2.16.

The only constant available is LOCK_TYPE().  There are no named
constants specified in the standard for this type.

The information about lock type values is moved from 6.2.2 to this
subbclause.

------------

Edits to 09-007:

[404:21-22] In 13.8.2.16 LOCK_TYPE, replace the third sentence
 (Variables ... unlocked.)  with

"All components have default initialization."

[404:22-23] Delete the last three sentences (Variables of type
... (6.2.2).) 

[404:23+] Add a new paragraph:

"A scalar variable of type LOCK_TYPE is a lock variable. A lock
 variable can have one of two states: locked and unlocked. The
 unlocked state is represented by the one value that is the initial
 value of a LOCK_TYPE variable; this is the value specified by the
 structure constructor LOCK_TYPE().  The locked state is represented
 by all other values. The value of a lock variable can be changed with
 the LOCK and UNLOCK statements (8.5.5).

Cxxx A named variable of type LOCK_TYPE shall be a coarray. A variable
with a LOCK_TYPE subcomponent shall be a coarray.

Cxxy A lock variable shall not appear in a variable definition context
except as the <lock-variable> in a LOCK or UNLOCK statement."

[404:23++] Add a new Note:

"Note 13.xx
The restrictions against changing a lock variable except via the LOCK
and UNLOCK statements ensure the integrity of its value and facilitate
efficient implementation, particularly when special synchronization is
needed for correct lock operation."
