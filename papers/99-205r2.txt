A. Introduction

Paper J3/98-239 describes the approved syntax for interoperability
between Fortran and C. This paper describes the syntax for the sharing
of global data between Fortran and C.

Note that this paper does not address the issues with BINDNAME= that were
raised in 99-211, which the committee discussed yesterday.

B. Edits

Edits refer to J3/99-007R2

Add BIND statements to the list of specification statements:
[10:36+] Add to R214
          "<<or>> <bind-stmt>"

Add the BIND attribute to the list of attributes in a type declaration.
[70:2+] Add to R504
          "<<or>> <language-binding-spec>"

This was a place-holder note to remind us to add interop. with C global data.
[70:9-11] Delete J3 note 147

Constraints on the use of the BIND attribute in a type declaration stmt.
[71:19+] Add the following constraints:
 "Constraint:  A <language-binding-spec> shall appear only in the 
               <specification-part> of a module.
  Constraint:  If a <language-binding-spec> is specified, the POINTER,
               PARAMETER, ALLOCATABLE, EXTERNAL, or INTRINSIC attribute shall
               not be specified.  The entity declared shall be a variable.
  Constraint:  If a <language-binding-spec> with a <bind-spec-list> appears,
               the <entity-decl-list> shall not contain more than one
               <entity-decl>."

An object with BIND can't have initialization.
[71:6]  After "an intrinsic name"
        add   ", an object with the BIND attribute, an object in a named common
               block that has the BIND attribute"

An object with BIND can't be initialized in a DATA statement.
[89:15] After "an automatic object"
        add   ", an object with the BIND attribute, an object in a common block
               that has the BIND attribute"

BNF for the BIND attribute.
[84:33+] Add new subsection, and move the BNF for <bind-spec> here (as 
suggested) to eliminate the long forward reference.
 "5.1.2.15 BIND attribute
  The BIND attribute specifies that the variable interoperates with a C
  variable with external linkage, as specified in 16.2.7.

  R5xx  <language-binding-spec>  <<is>>  BIND(C[, <bind-spec-list>])

  [[ Move text for R1224 [283:25-26] here.]]

  Constraint:  A <bind-spec-list> shall not contain more than one NAME=
               specifier.
  Constraint:  A <bind-spec-list> that appears in a BIND statement or a type
               declaration statement shall not contain more than one
               BINDNAME= specifier.

  [[Move the constraint on [284:25] here, and change
    "<scalar-default-initialization-expr>" to
    "<scalar-char-initialization-expr>".]]

  The BIND attribute shall not be specified for a variable or common block that
  cannot interoperate with some C variable with extern linkage.

  An entity with the BIND attribute also has the SAVE attribute."

Introduce the BIND statement
[88:26+] Add new section, and renumber subsequent sections
 "5.2.xx BIND statement

  R535   <bind-stmt>    <<is>>  <language-binding-spec> [::] <bind-entity-list>

  R536   <bind-entity>  <<is>>  <object-name>
                        <<or>>  / <common-block-name> /

  Constraint:  If any <bind-entity> in a <bind-stmt> is an <object-name>, the
               <bind-stmt> shall appear in the specification part of a module.
  Constraint:  If the <language-binding-spec> contains a <bind-spec-list>, the
               <bind-entity-list> shall not contain more than one
               <bind-entity>.

  The BIND statement specifies the BIND attribute (5.1.2.15) for a list of
  entities."

An object with BIND(C) can't appear in EQUIVALENCE
[94:39] After "a result name"
        add   ", a variable with the BIND attribute, a variable in a common
               block that has the BIND attribute"

An object with BIND(C) can't appear in a COMMON block
[97:3]  After "an entry name"
        add   ", a variable with the BIND attribute"

[283:24] Change "BIND(C [, <bind-spec-list>])"
         to     "<language-binding-spec>"

The following J3 note was handled by the edits to [84:33+]
[283:28-37] Delete J3 note 155.

The following four changes try to tidy up some information on global entities.
[361:12+] Add the new list item (and fix up the ", or" and "." preceding)
 "(6) A binding label (14.x)."

[415:19+] Add the following glossary entry
 "<<binding label>> (12.5.2.7, 16.2.7.1):  A value of type default character
  that uniquely identifies how a variable, common block, subroutine or
  function is known to a companion processor."

[418:5] After "a <common block>"
        add   ", a <binding label>"

[369:4+] Add the following new section, and renumber subsequent sections
 "14.x Scope of a binding label

  A binding label (12.5.2.7, 16.2.7.1) is a global entity.  Within a program,
  the name of a global entity shall not be the same as the binding label of a
  different global entity, without regard to case."

[411:35+] Add the following new section
 "16.2.7 Interoperation with C global variables
 
  A C variable with external linkage may interoperate with a variable declared
  in the scope of a module or with a common block.  A variable that is specified
  to have the BIND attribute shall interoperate with a C variable that has
  external linkage.  At most one variable that is associated with a particular
  C variable with external linkage is permitted to be declared within a
  program.

  [[Add J3 note]]
  As with procedural interoperability, we need to make it clear whether there
  must be such a C variable, or whether everything can be defined by Fortran
  alone.  In addition, we still need to draw a distinction between
  interoperating as a matching of a C type to a set of Fortran type and
  attributes as opposed to interoperating meaning that the Fortran and C things
  are "linked".
  [[End J3 note]]

  If a common block is specified in a BIND statement, it shall be specified in
  a BIND statement with the same binding label in each scoping unit in which it
  is declared.  A C variable with external linkage interoperates with a common
  block that has been specified in a BIND(C) statement,

    (1) if the C variable is of a struct type and the variables that are members
        of the common block interoperate with corresponding components of the
        struct type, or
    (2) if the common block contains a single variable, and the variable
        interoperates with the C variable.

  NOTE 16.17
  The following are examples of the usage of the BIND attribute for variables
  and for a common block.  The Fortran variables, C_EXTERN and C2, interoperate
  with the C variables, c_extern and myVariable, respectively.  The Fortran
  common blocks, COM and SINGLE, interoperate with the C variables, com and
  single, respectively.

  MODULE LINK_TO_C_VARS
    USE ISO_C_BINDING
    INTEGER(C_INT), BIND(C) :: C_EXTERN
    INTEGER(C_LONG) :: C2
    BIND(C, NAME='myVariable') :: C2

    COMMON /COM/ R, S
    REAL(C_FLOAT) :: R, S, T
    BIND(C) :: /COM/, /SINGLE/
    COMMON /SINGLE/ T
  END MODULE LINK_TO_C_VARS

  int c_extern;
  long myVariable;
  struct {float r, s;} com;
  float single;

  END NOTE 16.17

  16.2.7.1 Binding labels for common blocks and variables

  The <<binding label>> of a variable or common block is a value of type
  default character that specifies the name by which the variable or common
  block is known to the companion processor.

  If a variable or common block has the BIND attribute specified with a NAME=
  specifier, the binding label is the value of the expression specified for the
  NAME= specifier.  The case of letters in the binding label is significant,
  but leading and trailing blanks are ignored.  If a variable or common block
  has the BIND attribute specified without a NAME= specifier, the binding label
  is the same as the name of the entity using lower case letters.

  The binding label of a C variable with extern linkage is the same as the name
  of the C variable.  A Fortran variable or common block with the BIND
  attribute that has the same binding label as a C variable with extern linkage
  is associated with that variable.

  [[Add J3 note]]
  We need details here (or elsewhere) about how changes to the C variable
  affect the Fortran thing, and vice versa.  This is something that also affects
  procedure interoperability.  We also need to specify how the variables in the
  common block "line up" with members of the C struct.  Does simply relying on
  the concept of storage association work?
  [[End J3 note]]

  The meaning of the expression following a BINDNAME= specifier is processor
  dependent."

  Add the following Index entries:
    <<BIND>>       [[ref to R5xx (added above)]]
    BIND statement [[ref to 5.2.xx (added above)]]
    <bind-stmt>    [[ref to 5.2.xx (added above)]]
    <bind-spec>    [[ref to 5.1.2.15 (added above)]]
    <language-binding-spec>   [[ref to 5.1.2.15 (added above)]]

  Change the index entry for
    "NAME= specifier   218"
  to
    "NAME= specifier,
        in the INQUIRE statement  218
        in the <language-binding-spec>  [[ref to 5.1.2.15 (added above)]]"

[290:12+] Add the following sentence to Note 156.
 "See also 16.2.7.1, which also has similar text referring to BINDNAME=."
