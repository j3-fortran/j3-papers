Subject: Interp F03/0080 Formatted output of a negative real zero value
Date: 2007 September 13

The only action taken at meeting #175 was that this interp was
accepted as an interp "to be processed".

NUMBER: F03/0080
TITLE: Formatted output of a negative real zero value
KEYWORDS: formatted output, negative zero, IEEE
DEFECT TYPE: ERRATUM
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

     Suppose a Fortran processor's representation of
     the real zero value is signed.  When a negative
     real zero value is written using formatted output:

     (a)  Does the Fortran 2003 standard allow the
          representation of the zero value in the
          output field to be prefixed with a minus
          sign?

     (b)  Does the Fortran 2003 standard require the
          representation of the zero value in the
          output field to be prefixed with a minus
          sign?

ANSWER:
     (a)  Yes.  Although Section 4.4.2 lists some
          contexts as requiring positive and negative zeros to
          be treated as equivalent, formatted output is not
          on that list of contexts.  Negative zero can already
          be produced by formatted output, for example by

                PRINT '(F4.1)', -0.000001

          which in Fortran 95 (but not Fortran 90) is required
          to write "-0.0" or " -.0".

     (b)  Yes, or Not Necessarily (edits provided for both).  The
          first choice promotes portability.

          (b1) The negative sign is required to appear in
               formatted output of a negative zero value.

          (b2) Negative zero values may be treated as negative
               values in formatted output at the option of the
               implementor.

DISCUSSION:

     A negative zero value is negative by name but zero
     by nature.  Therefore a context which refers to negative
     values must always be inspected to see if it is appropriate
     to also include negative zero values, and the instance in
     10.6.1 needs amendment.

EDITS:

     For (b1):
        [227:3-4] Change from

        The representation of a negative internal value in the field
        shall be prefixed with a minus sign.

        to

        The representation of a negative internal value or a negative
        zero value in the field shall be prefixed with a minus sign.


     For (b2):
        [227:4] Add the sentence

        The representation of a negative zero value
        in the field may be prefixed with a minus sign.
