Date:     November 12, 1996
To:       X3J3
From:     Christian Weber
Subject:  Miscellaneous Requirements for Fortran 2000


                                                 16th Oct. 1996
Dear Fortran Colleagues,

I have now finished the collection of requirements which may be
considered as "miscellaneous", and I have described these in
the attached document "Miscellaneous requirements for
Fortran2000" (version 1); this document also reflects the email
comments which I have received so far.

Would you please review the document concerning

-    completeness of the list (are any requirements missing?),
     and

-    the classification (which I have done out of my personal
     judgment) concerning the work caused to X3J3 by the
     requirement (which essentially also yields the
     identification as "minor technical enhancement").

Could you furthermore give additional information (technical
information, example F95 extensions, items to be discussed
etc.) concerning these requirements as input to the second
version of the attached document which I plan to prepare by
december 10th (so please send in your comments by end of
november).

Together with the distribution of the second version of the
document I would like to start an "opinion poll" about the
priority of these requirements which will last until December
24th, such that I have enough time left to incorporate the
results into the final version of the document (which has to be
ready in time for the Las Vegas meeting).

I would suggest (much according to Gerhard Schmitt's
suggestions) to proceed with this opinion poll as follows:

-    every member of this subgroup gives an opinion if he is
     *opposed* to a particular requirement regardless of the
     work caused by it (this part of the opinion poll also
     includes minor technical enhancements, and if there is
     strong and/or unanimous opposition to a particular
     requirement it should be removed altogether from the
     requirements list);

-    furthermore, every member of this subgroup has - say - 20
     "priority points" which he can distribute to the *major*
     (i.e. the non-minor technical enhancements) requirements
     with a maximum of 3 points per individual item (this limit
     shall prevent that requirements which are wanted very
     strongly by only one individual may get too much weight).
     It could be debated if requirements causing a "large"
     amount of work shall cost more priority points than
     "medium" requirements.

Miscellaneous Requirements for Fortran2000
============================================
(Christian Weber, 16th Oct. 1996, Version 1)

1. Introduction
---------------
To facilitate the discussion of requirements for Fortran2000,
this documents collects all requirements which may be
considered as miscellaneous, i.e. which are

-    neither concerned with better data or interface
     abstraction,
-    nor concerned with aspects of high-performance numerical
     computing,

since such requirements are handled by the other subgroups.

Furthermore, this document does not deal with requirements
which are already handled by a dedicated activity (e.g. some
TR, such as the IEEE TR), or which aim at an improvement of the
standards process or standards document itself: Such
requirements have to observed by the developmend body directly
at all activities - they cannot be compared with "technical"
requirements within the same list.

For all the miscellaneous requirements this document does not
want to duplicate the information already contained in the
requirement repository, but rather concentrates on

-    adding further technical information (wherever known)
     especially if it may be helpful to judge how much work to
     X3J3 this requirement will cause, and

-    adding some "importance weight" (after the opinion poll) to
     each requirement for all major requirements (it is assumed
     that minor technical enhancements will be handled anyway by
     X3J3 at each large standard revision such as Fortran2000).

In the following, the requirements are classified according to
the amount of work caused to X3J3 as follows:

-    "small" (amount of work): the requirement is technically
     fairly simple, does not cause a lot of discussion, there is
     no principal objection to be expected (apart from the "keep
     the language small!" principle), and it can be covered with
     1 page of edits. Such requirements may be considered as
     "minor technical enhancement".

-    "medium": fairly straighforward enhancements with 1-3 pages
     of edits which are concentrated essentially in one chapter
     of the standard.

-    "large": more pages with edits, and/or many places in the
     standards document to be updated, and/or controversial
     discussions to be expected.

The requirements are ordered according to the document chapter(s)
addressed, and the numbers in the titles refer to the entry-
number in the requirements repository.

Recent changes of the requirements list:
As a result of the recent email comments, repository entry 72
("Extend ALLOCATE to specify non-kind type parameters") is not
considered to be miscellaneous any more, but is assigned to
"data abstraction" since 72 deals with full support of derived
type paramters rather than the enhancement of the executable
statement ALLOCATE.
Furthermore, I considered requirement 51 ("Annex of processor
dependent items") to be of general nature (i.e. concerned with
the standards process in general) and therefore did not
incorporate it into the miscellaneous requirements list.


2.  General Syntax Enhancements
2.1 Block Comments (Repository-entry 7)

Subject:
There should be some syntax to mark a whole "block of comments"
(which spans several lines) without specifying "!" on each
individual line.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Note:
This requirement might already been satisfied by the "condi
tional compilation facility" (which allows to blank out large
blocks of text - e.g. comments - from the compilation process).

Amount of work for X3J3:
small.

2.2 Lower Case Syntax Elements (67)

Subject:
Lower case letters should always be accepted as equivalent to
upper case letters (outside character context).
(Currently, the support of lower case letters - in the sense
above - is only optional).

Rationale...:
see repository.

Amount of work for X3J3:
small.

2.3 Reserved words (92)

Subject:
The use of reserved words should be forbidden for other than
their dedicated purposes (e.g. as variable names).

Rationale...:
see repository.

Amount of work for X3J3:
small.

3.  Constants and Expressions
3.1 Extend Initialization of COMPLEX Variables (66)

Subject:
The syntax of constant expressions should allow that complex
constants can be pieced together from the real and imaginary
part treated separately, as e.g. by CMPLX(ANTON,DORA)) with
ANTON/DORA being real named constants.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Amount of work for X3J3:
small.

3.2 Permit BOZ constants in the TRANSFER function (69)

Subject:
The use of binary/octal/decimal literal constants should be
extended to the TRANSFER function (currently, these are only
allowed in DATA statements)

Rationale...:
see repository.

Problems:
I doubt that the use of BOZ constants can reasonably be limited
to a particular function (as e.g. TRANSFER); it might be
extended in general, though.

Amount of work for X3J3:
small.

3.3 Allow MERGE in constant expressions (71)

Subject:
Allow some further intrinsic function reference (i.e. MERGE) in
constant expressions.

Rationale...:
see repository.

I am not fully sure what exactly is missing in Fortran95 (MERGE
appears to be elemental and therefore is permitted already in
constant expressions - or not?).

Amount of work for X3J3:
small.

3.4 New Special Character designations (77)

Subject:
Special characters usual in UNIX/C language (such as \n=new
line, \t=tab) should be allowed in Fortran character context.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Problems:
Interaction of \n with the Fortran "end-of-record" concept?

Amount of work for X3J3:
medium.

4.  Data Types
4.1 Bit Data Type, String (21)

Subject:
There should be a data type BIT (concatenable to a string as
the present character data type) which actually uses one bit of
storage.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Problems:
There are doubts within the DIN working group that the BIT type
is really needed (alternatives: better bit intrinsics which
operate on INTEGER arrays, or some LOGICAL kind which assigns
one bit of storage in combination with some general "stringing"
facility).

Amount of work for X3J3:
large.

4.2 Varying length character with declared maximum (34)

Subject:
Establish a PL1-like data type CHARACTER VARYING with some
declared maximum (where the Fortran system handles the "current
length" bookkeeping).

Rationale...:
see repository.

Problems:
This data type is a kind of competitor (within Fortran) to the
string module.
The fixed maximum length (necessary for a very efficient
implementation) limits its usefulness.

Amount of work for X3J3:
large.

4.3 Unsigned INTEGER Data Type (37)

Subject:
Enhance the number model for integers to include unsigned
numbers (0..maximum).

Rationale...:
Make best use of the current hardware architectures which
normally do support unsigned numbers; C-Interoperability; see
also repository.

Problems:
If C-Interoperability is the main issue, then simpler means
(MAP_TO approach, some conversion intrinsic) may solve the
problems.

Amount of work for X3J3:
medium.

4.4 Specifying Default Precisions (49)

Subject:
The user should be able to define the KIND value which is
implicitly assigned to all floating point numbers which do not
have an explicit kind specification.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Amount of work for X3J3:
medium.

5.  Control Flow Constructs
5.1 Exception Handling (5,5a,5b,5c)

Subject:
The requirement deals with enhancements in two directions:

(1)  Establish some high-level control flow constructs (such as
     ENABLE... / SIGNAL) to define - for a certain code region -
     a central (user-defined) exception handling mechanism which
     is invoked by the processor whenever an error (of a certain
     kind) occurs

     *    within the designated piece of code, or
     *    within a subroutine which is invoked (either directly
          or indirectly at any calling depth) from within the
          designated piece of code.

     The control flow construct should allow

     *    block-structured nesting of exception handling
          definitions, and
     *    the signaling of user-detected exceptions at any
          calling depth which will cause a jump ("longjump") to
          the nearest appropriate exception handling block
          further up the calling chain.

(2)  Establish some mechanism to control the behaviour of the
     processor in certain error situations where now (normally
     in a processor-dependent fashion)

     *    the program is terminated with some error message, or
     *    the error might be ignored, resulting in wrong program
          results.

     Examples for such error situations are:

     *    IEEE floating point exceptions if the algorithm shall
          be halted in case of error (note that the IEEE TR
          covers *only* the case of continuation with not-a-
          number results after exceptions),
     *    integer arithmetic exceptions,
     *    lack of memory,
     *    I/O errors if no IOSTAT... parameter has been
          specified,
     *    access of array elements beyond the index bounds,
     *    access of dummy arguments which are not present,
     etc.

Example how the requirement might be satisfied:
The last version of John Reid's ENABLE proposal would
essentially satisfy all the requirements.
It introduced for the definition of "exception areas" a syntax
like:

ENABLE (condition)
  ....
  Fortran code to be controlled
  ....
HANDLE
  ....
  Fortran code to deal with the exception
  ....
END ENABLE

For signalling a user-detected exception there was some new

SIGNAL (condition)

statement.

Some reduced syntax (as Jerry Wagener has proposed) might be -
as a first step - sufficient as well.

It should be possible to discuss separately the general high-
level construct (ENABLE...) and the set of error situations
which have to be detected by every Fortran processor.


Rationale:
The reasons for exception handling (in general) are described
in the repository.
It has been argued that the exception handling needs are now
sufficiently satisfied by the IEEE TR. This is, however, only
partially true:

-    The IEEE deals with IEEE floating point exceptions only,
     and even with these only if the algorithm may be continued
     (with not-a-number result) in case of error.
     All the other exceptions (see above) cannot be handled so
     far.

-    There is no high-level construct yet to deal with
     exceptions at a central point, especially if the exceptions
     occur further down the calling chain.
     Therefore, the handling of exceptions which may occur in
     subroutines must currently be programmed as follows:

     *    the subroutine reports any exception by some return
          parameter value,
     *    at each invocation of the subroutine the caller must
          inquire this return value, normally just to stop the
          further processing in case of error and to hand back a
          (different) return value to its own caller.

     This handling is very error prone and causes the production
     of a lot of lines of code which are unnecessary in other
     programming languages (such as C++ which *does* offer an
     appropriate exception handling feature).

Problems:

(1)  The routines along the call chain between the exception
     handling block and the "signalling" point must always be
     prepared for a termination by "longjump". This preparation
     may involve some additional calling overhead even if no
     exception ever occurs.

     Possible solutions:
     *    accept the overhead (which is not all that large after
          all),
     *    demand from the user that he marks all subroutines
          which should prepare to for a longjump termination with
          some new syntax construct (e.g. USE EXCEPTION_SUPPORT).

(2)  The detection of certain exceptions may be difficult to
     implement (e.g. INTEGER_OVERFLOW may not be supported by
     all hardware architectures).

(3)  The impact of exception handling on optimization must be
     carefully observed (I think, though, that John Reid's
     proposal has solved this problem adequately).

Amount of work for X3J3:
large, although a good part (most?) of the necessary work has
already been done by John Reid's ENABLE proposal.

5.2 Extend the semantics of the EXIT statement (25)

Subject:
Enhance EXIT such that any kind of executable block construct
can be left.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Amount of work for X3J3:
small.

6.  Procedures
6.1 Nesting of internal procedures (33)

Subject:
It should be possible to define internal procedures which are
local to other internal procedures.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Amount of work for X3J3:
medium (large?).


6.2 Allow internal procedures as actual arguments (42)

Subject:
It should be possible to pass the names of internal procedures
as actual arguments.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Problems:
Since internal procedures have access to the variables in all
the surrounding scoping units, it has to be defined how this
access works (and has to be implemented) from an internal
procedure which is called via an external procedure.

Example (-> means "subroutine call"):

anton -> berta (internal to anton) -> otto (external, getting
berta as actual argument) -> berta (by calling the dummy-arg-
procedure).

Let's assume that berta accesses the variable xyz with xyz
being a local (stack) variable of procedure anton: how is this
access organized from the second invocation of anton, with
"otto" (being external) interrupting the purely internal
calling chain?
(Such problems are present in the PASCAL language currently and
have been solved there, but it was complicated for users as
well as implementors).

Amount of work for X3J3:
large.


6.3 New INTENT attribute: COPY_IN (100)

Subject:
There should be the possibility to specify COPY_IN as INTENT
attribute to dummy arguments (meaning that the argument may be
overwritten, but the value change must not be transferred to
the caller).

Rationale...:
see repository.

Amount of work for X3J3:
medium.


7.  Executable Statements
7.1 Controlling Pointer Bounds (2)

Subject:
The pointer assignment statement for array pointer variables
should allow to specify new index bounds (together with the
pointer target).

Rationale...:
see repository.

Amount of work for X3J3:
medium.


7.2 Selecting subarrays of non-rectangular form (26)

Subject:
Allow the use of implied-do control on the right hand side of a
pointer assignment to an array pointer.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Amount of work for X3J3:
medium.


8.  FORMAT processing
8.1 Variable Repeat Specifiers in Formats (48)

Subject:
It should be allowed that repeat specifiers in FORMAT
specifications may be variables (and not just constants).

Rationale...:
see repository.

Problems:
It might be sufficient to establish a simple integer-to-charac
ter conversion intrinsic function - say TO_CHAR(integer) -
which returns the external character representation of any
integer argument (the user could write such a routine himself
using internal I/O, but this is very clumsy).
Then the example problem (see repository) could be solved by

FMT='10X,'//TO_CHAR(M)//'(2X,''NO'',2X)'

and there would be no need for a new construct within the core
language any more.

Amount of work for X3J3:
medium (small for the additional intrinsic).


9.  I/O enhancements
9.1 STREAM I/O, Binary stream I/O (63, 63a)

Subject:
In parallel to the current record-oriented I/O, Fortran should
also provide support for binary (stream-oriented) I/O which is
usual in UNIX (and in the C programming language) and which
deals with files that have no record structure.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Amount of work for X3J3:
large.


9.2 Non-advancing I/0 combined with free format, Extend non-
advancing I/O to List-Directed I/O (63b, 65)

Subject:
Allow the combination of list-directed I/O with nonadvancing
I/O

Rationale...:
see repository.

Note:
Why has this combination ever been forbidden? Just by accident,
or was there any reason?

Amount of work for X3J3:
small.


9.3 Any Kind of Integer for I/O Specifiers (68)

Subject:
Allow integers of any KIND - and not just default integers - to
be specified with I/O parameters (such as IOSTAT=integer-var,
...).

Rationale...:
see repository.

Notes:
The only "default integer" constraint which actually might
create a problem (if the "default" should happen to be 2-byte-
integers) appears to be the IOLENGTH parameter in the INQUIRE
statement (all other "default" constraints only refer to error
codes or formatted record length where I cannot imagine any
real problems).

Amount of work for X3J3:
small.


9.4 Named Scratch Files (73)

Subject:
Allow names to be assigned to scratch files.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Problems:
If two programs (or program units) open the same file (i.e.
file with the same name) as scratch file: do they get different
files, or do they access the same file (and possibly get OPEN
errors)?

Amount of work for X3J3:
small (may be medium).


9.5 Default I/O mode (76)

Subject:
Allow the default I/O mode for READ/WRITE statements to be
ADVANCE="NO" (depending on some new OPEN parameter).

Rationale...:
see repository.

Amount of work for X3J3:
medium (simple, but probably many places to look at).


9.6 Recognition of TAB characters in Fortran input (79)

Subject:
Treat TAB characters like the corresponding string of blanks in
(formatted) Fortran input.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Amount of work for X3J3:
small.


9.7 New keywords READ_EOR, READ_EOF, WRITE_EOR (?), WRITE_EOF
(?) in INQUIRE statements (93)

Subject:
Create a way to inquire about the current EOR and/or EOF status
of a file.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Amount of work for X3J3:
small.


9.8 New keywords IS_EOR and IS_EOF in INQUIRE, READ and WRITE
statements (94)

Subject:
Create a way to inquire if EOR and/or EOF have occurred on a
file.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Amount of work for X3J3:
small.


9.9 New keywords DEFAULT_READ and DEFAULT_WRITE in INQUIRE
statement (95)

Subject:
Create a way to obtain the default unit number for READ or
WRITE.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Problems:
The standard does not demand currently that the default units
must be ordinary (numbered) units as well: this might create
compatibility problems.

Amount of work for X3J3:
small.


10.  Access to Features of the Environment
10.1 Command Line Arguments and Environmental Variables (20)

Subject:
Create some standardized interface (i.e. replace all those
system-specific interfaces which nearly all vendors offer) to
access command line arguments and/or environment variables.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Amount of work for X3J3:
small.


10.2 POSIX Binding to Fortran 90 (47)

Subject:
Provide some standardized interface to access (all?) POSIX
features from Fortran.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Problems:
The requirement might be covered by the standard C-interface of
POSIX in combination with the C interoperability.

It will be difficult to keep up with the development of POSIX
if the interface responsibility is not assigned to the POSIX
committee.

Amount of work for X3J3:
large (POSIX is big!).


10.3 Operation System Support (86)

Subject:
Provide a standard interface to pass a command string to the
operating system for execution.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Problems:
The requirement may be covered by 10.2 (see above).

Since the syntax of the command string will not be
standardized, one might as well leave the "command string
execution interface" system dependent as well.

Amount of work for X3J3:
small.


10.4 Handling of error messages (99)

Subject:
Provide some standard interface to obtain some reasonable error
message text for each IOSTAT... value produced by the
processor.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Problems:
National language support?
Context sensitivity of error messages (i.e. which message text
is produced if the same IOSTAT value can be produced by two
different error situations?).

Amount of work for X3J3:
medium.


10.5 Primitive graphic facilities in Fortran (102)

Subject:
Provide some elementary graphics features (e.g. "draw pixel",
"draw line") which can be supported nowadays by nearly all (?)
current terminal devices.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Amount of work for X3J3:
large.

Notes:
c. the more detailed description of the proposal (presented at
the Dresden meeting) in the attachment as an illustration what
exactly is intended.

11.  New / better Intrinsic functions
11.1 Regularize RANDOM_SEED functionality (55)

Subject:
Provide some means to reset the random number generator in a
non-repeatable way (and furthermore create a more comfortable
interface for the repeatable reset).

Rationale...:
see repository.

Amount of work for X3J3:
small.


11.2 Generic COUNT_RATE Argument for SYSTEM_CLOCK (61)

Subject:
Allow real numbers as COUNT_RATE argument (not only default
integers) in SYSTEM_CLOCK.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Amount of work for X3J3:
small.

11.3 Extend MAX, MIN, etc. to CHARACTER Data Type (64)

Subject:
Extend various MAX... intrinsics to accept character arguments
(for regularity).

Rationale...:
see repository.

Amount of work for X3J3:
small.

11.4 Intrinsic 'size' function for derived types (80)

Subject:
Provide some intrinsic to obtain the (processor-dependent) byte
size of Fortran data objects.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Amount of work for X3J3:
small.


11.5 Instrinsic 'sort' for arrays of intrinsic type (81)

Subject:
Provide some sorting facility.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Amount of work for X3J3:
small.


11.6 Intrinsic function 'fft' - Fast Fourier Transformation
(82)

Subject:
Secure the availability of the "Fast Fourier transformation" on
every Fortran processor.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Amount of work for X3J3:
small.


11.7 Four new elemental intrinsic functions: TRUNCATE, ROUND,
IBCHNG,ICOUNT (90)

Subject:
Provide some new functions for rounding (of real numbers) and
bit handling (within integers).

Rationale...:
see repository.

Amount of work for X3J3:
small.


11.8 PATTERN= in bit manipulation functions such as IBCLR,
IBSET, IBCHNG (91)

Subject:
Improve the bit handling intrinsic functions.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Amount of work for X3J3:
small.


11.9 New transformational functions: POSITION and LOCATION (97)

Subject:
Offer new functions for easier positioning of an array element
within some multidimensional array.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Amount of work for X3J3:
small.


11.10 New functions to handle arrays: SCRIPT and SCALAR (98)

Subject:
Offer new functions for easier positioning of an array element
within some multidimensional array.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Amount of work for X3J3:
small.


12.  Relaxation of Restrictions
12.1 Remove the restriction on the maximum rank of arrays,
Greater than 7 Array Dimensions (24, 24a)

Subject:
Increase the number of array dimensions which has to be
supported by every processor.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Amount of work for X3J3:
small.


12.2 Remove limitation on statement length (50)

Subject:
Increase the minimum statement length (currently 40*132
characters) which must be supported by every processor.

Rationale...:
see repository.

Amount of work for X3J3:
small.

===========
(to illustrate requirement 10.5 / repository entry 102)


     THE CANADIAN FORTRAN 2000 PRIMITIVE GRAPHICS PROPOSAL

The Canadian proposal is that Fortran 2000 be given a set of
primitive capabilities that would permit graphic objects to be
placed on a display surface.

Fortran now has very adequate facilities for developing the
software required for performing the higher graphic operations
such as clipping, scaling,the execution of other transformations,
and doing three-dimensional modelling.  However, it does not have
the facilities for performing the elementary graphic functions
such as drawing or picking a point on a display screen.  The
result is that a program written in Fortran must use non-standard
features if it is to perform any graphic operations.  Thus, if the
program is to be later transferred to another different platform,
the graphic part has to be re-written specifically for the new
platform.

While this limitation of standard Fortran may not present
difficulties for Fortran users having the appropriate resources
and technical knowledge, it does present difficulties, often
insurmountable, for many Fortran users with fewer resources.

In the past, Fortran has been especially suited for use by
scientists and engineers who are experts in their own disciplines
first, and programmers only secondly.  These people badly need
access to convenient computer graphics, not necessarily the
powerful computer graphics required by CAD systems or commercial
displays, but enough graphics to permit them to develop programs
that will produce graphs, figures and diagrams.  Even the
computational efficiency of certain commercial graphics systems is
not required because of the speed of modern CPUs.  For example,
many programmers and users could live with software clipping in
Fortran rather than clipping by hardware or assembler, if the only
alternative were non-portable programs.

What is required is access to the very basic graphic primitives in
a platform- independent manner.  This would permit the
computational power of Fortran to be used for the development of
specialized in-house programs by scientists and engineers having
modest computer expertise.  Such programs could be easily moved
from one platform to another.

In this proposal, we have avoided, at this time, the exact setting
forth of the primitive graphic features which we would like to see
contained in Fortran 2000. These features should be the minimum
required to permit a variety of types of graphic displays.  Any
feature that could be implemented with reasonably efficient
software written in present-day Fortran should probably be omitted
at this time.       For example, no new Fortran features are required
to do graphic scaling and panning.  Present-day Fortran is very
adequate for that purpose.
Some of the features that should be provided are as follows:

(1)  Turning on and off of the graphics mode.

(2)  Some control over the number of pixels to be used
     horizontally and vertically to represent the display
     surface, of course subject to the limitations of the
     graphics hardware in use.

(3)  Some control over colour ranges, again subject to hardware
     limitations.

(4)  An ability to draw a point (a pixel) on a selected location
     on the display surface, using a colour selected from the
     colour palate in use.  Once this capability is available,
     almost any graphic display can be done using present-day
     Fortran, although perhaps not as quickly as with
     specialized graphic systems.

(5)  An ability to pick a selected point on a display surface
     using a pointing device such as a mouse.  This would permit
     drawing and editing directly on the screen.

Some features that would be less essential but nevertheless
desirable would be:

(1)  The drawing of straight lines between any two points on the
     display surface.  This would permit the Fortran programmer
     to produce software that would draw a variety of curved
     and/or broken lines with more efficiency than if only
     pixels were available.

(2)  A minimum set of text fonts with size, colour, location and
     orientation under the control of the Fortran programmer.
     This feature would promote speed and simplify programming.

(3)  Boundary clipping.  This may save the Fortran programmer
     some trouble.

The objective would not be to provide in Fortran the resources
necessary to develop efficient CAD or commercial display systems
in a platform-independent manner.  The programmers of such systems
would be expected to have the technical and other resources to
develop such systems for each individual platform intended to be
used.     The provision of the facilities for developing such systems
in platform-independent Fortran could place an unreasonable burden
on Fortran compiler writers at this time.

It may be suggested that X-Windows, the various versions of
Microsoft Windows such as 3.X, 95 or NT, or the hopefully
forthcoming Posix graphic features, will have the effect of making
our proposal unnecessary.  In practice, at this time and in the
foreseeable future, none of these systems has or is likely to have
anything at all close to universal acceptance.

Another alternative that may be proposed is a more widespread use
of the GKS or PHIGS standards.  The GKS standard is now
approximately ten years old and  substantial differences of
opinion between different users seem to be impeding  the updating
of the Standard.  The software necessary to implement the GKS
Standard does not appear to be readily available for some
important platforms.   When it is available, it may be expensive
for users with limited resources and  it may provide much
functionality that is not needed, redundant or even in the  way
for many users. By contrast, the Fortran code required to exploit
the  proposed primitive Fortran graphic functions can easily
developed, published, and  made available to Fortran programmers
with limited resources.  The required  algorithms are generally
readily available to programmers having some initiative. Something
similar has already been done for certain platform-dependent
versions of the programming language Basic. However, the
benefits of such work in Basic have been limited because of the
platform-dependence problem.

The example of Basic is an interesting one.  In spite of their
substantial  limitations, platform-dependent versions of Basic
continue to be used on a  substantial scale in scientific and
engineering offices because these versions  of Basic contain
graphic primitives which can be used to good effect by
unsophisticated programmers.

I would be pleased to have the opportunity to discuss this
proposal with any of the delegates to the present Dresden WG5
meeting on Fortran.
