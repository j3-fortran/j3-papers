NUMBER: F18/nnnn
TITLE: FORM TEAM and failed images
KEYWORDS: failed images, FORM TEAM
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION 1:
18-007r1, 11.6.9 p6 says "If execution of a FORM TEAM statement
assigns the value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE to the stat-variable, the effect
is the same as for the successful execution of FORM TEAM except for
the value assigned to stat-variable."
How can this be the case?  11.6.11 says:
"If a STAT= specifier appears in a sync-stat in an image control
statement, the stat-variable is assigned the value zero if execution
of the statement is successful."

ANSWER 1:
This was intended to refer to a successful execution for the team of
active images. An edit is provided.

EDIT 1:
In 11.6.9 FORM TEAM statement p6 add "on a team consisting of the
active images of the team" before "except" to make the sentence read
"If execution of a FORM TEAM statement assigns the value
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE to the stat-variable, the effect is the same as for
the successful execution of FORM TEAM on a team consisting of the
active images of the team except for the value assigned to
stat-variable."

QUESTION 2:
If there are any failed images in a team that executes a FORM TEAM
statement, do these images belong to any of the new teams?

ANSWER 2:
No, provided the statement is successful or returns with its
stat-variable having the value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE. See edit 1 above.

QUESTION 3:
What happens if a new team was intended to have 16 images, one of these
images has failed, and an active image of the new team specified 16 as
its NEW_INDEX value?

ANSWER 3:
This would be an error condition because the new team has 15 images.
If no image in the team has stopped and the FORM TEAM statement has a
STAT= specifier, the variable specified will be given a
processor-dependent value other than STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE and
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE. This follows from the rules in 11.6.11, p5.

QUESTION 4:
In the definition of the FAILED_IMAGES intrinsic function, 16.9.77 p5
states: "If the executing image has previously executed an
image control statement whose STAT= specifier assigned the value
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE from the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV, or
referenced a collective subroutine whose STAT argument was set to
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, at least one image in the set of images
participating in that image control statement or collective
subroutine reference shall be known to have failed."
Should the list include the cases of a reference to the intrinsic
IMAGE_STATUS that returned STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, an atomic subroutine
with a STAT argument was set to STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, and an image
selector with a STAT= specifier that was set to STAT_FAILED_IMAGE?

ANSWER 4:
Yes. An edit is provided.

EDIT 4:
In 16.9.77 FAILED_IMAGES ([TEAM, KIND]) p5, change
"or referenced a collective subroutine whose STAT argument was set to
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, at least one image in the set of images
participating in that image control statement or collective
subroutine reference"
to
"referenced an atomic or a collective subroutine with a STAT argument
that assigned the value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, referenced an image
selector with a STAT= specifier that assigned the value
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, or referenced the intrinsic IMAGE_STATUS with value
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, at least one image in the set of images
involved in that execution or reference"
so that the sentence reads:
"If the executing image has previously executed an image control
statement whose STAT= specifier assigned the value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE
from the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV, referenced an atomic or a
collective subroutine with a STAT argument that assigned the value
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, referenced an image selector with a STAT=
specifier that assigned the value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, or referenced the
intrinsic IMAGE_STATUS with value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE, at least one image
in the set of images involved in that execution or reference shall
be known to have failed."

QUESTION 5:
A collective subroutine is defined (3.143.2) as an
"intrinsic subroutine that performs a calculation on a team of images
without requiring synchronization", and collective subroutines
are invoked "on all active images of its current team in segments that
are not ordered with respect to each other" (16.6 par. 1). Is
the guarantee provided by 16.6 par. 7:
"If the STAT argument is present and ... the current team contained
failed images, an error condition occurs and the value
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE from the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV is
assigned to the STAT argument"
too strong? It seems to imply that all images in the team will have
knowledge of a failed image if there is one.

ANSWER 5:
Yes. It was not intended to require a synchronization of all the images
involved. Rather than "if the current team contained failed images",
the standard should say "if the current team is detected to contain
failed images". This is particularly important for CO_BROADCAST,
because the failure of one image does not prevent others receiving
the correct result, and each should be allowed to continue execution
as soon as it has the result.

EDIT 5:
In 16.6 Collective subroutines, para 7, sentence 2, change
"if the current team contained failed images"
to
"if the current team is detected to contain failed images".
so that the sentence becomes
"Otherwise, if the current team is detected to contain failed images,
an error condition occurs and the value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE from the
intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV is assigned to the STAT argument."
