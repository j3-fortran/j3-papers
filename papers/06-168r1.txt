1. Introduction

This paper contains edits for the intelligent macro facility whose specs and
syntax are in 06-123r1, excluding the block-local variable edits which appear
in 06-142.  Rationale for this facility appears in 05-280.

2. Changes to the Specifications from 06-123r1

3. Changes to the Syntax from 06-123r1

3.1 PRESENT intrinsic

The suggested syntax in 06-123r1 for handling optional macro dummy arguments
is defective in that although it successfully handles absent ones, it forces
present ones to expand to a single name.  This is obviously bad!

Therefore, in a macro expression only, PRESENT(<macro-dummy-arg-name>)
should *expand* either to .TRUE. or .FALSE., i.e. it is "evaluated" by
expansion rather than normal evaluation.

4. Edits to 04-007

   3.5.1 Macro definition

   A macro definition defines a macro.  A defined macro may only be referenced
   by a USE statement, IMPORT statement, or macro expansion statement.  A
   defined macro shall not be redefined.

   R313 <macro-definition> <<is>> <define-macro-stmt>

   C3nn (R314) A <macro-dummy-arg-name> shall not appear more than once in a
        <macro-dummy-arg-name-list>.

   R315 <macro-attribute> <<is>> <access-spec>

   The DEFINE MACRO statement begins the definition of the macro <macro-name>.
   Appearance of an <access-spec> in the DEFINE MACRO statement explicitly
   gives the macro the specified attribute.  Each <macro-dummy-arg-name> is
   a macro dummy argument.  A macro dummy argument is a macro local variable.

   C3nn (R317) A <macro-local-variable-name> shall not be the same as the name
        of a dummy argument of the macro being defined.

   C3nn (R318) A <macro-dummy-arg-name> shall be the name of a dummy argument
        of the macro being defined.

   C3nn (R319) If <macro-expr> appears, when the macro is expanded it shall be
        of type integer, and have a non-negative value that specifies a
        representation method that exists on the processor.

   A macro type declaration statement specifies that the named entities are
   macro local variables of the specified type.  If the kind is not specified,
   they are of default kind.  A macro local variable that is not a macro dummy
   argument shall appear in a macro type declaration statement.

   C3nn A statement in a macro definition that is not a <macro-body-construct>
        or <macro-definition> shall not appear on a line with any other
        statement.

                               [ , <macro-do-limit> ]

   C3nn (R322) A <macro-do-variable-name> shall be a local variable of the
        macro being defined, and shall not be a macro dummy argument.

   R322a <macro-do-limit> <<is>> <macro-expr>

   C3nn (R322a) A <macro-do-limit> shall expand to an expression of type
        integer.

   R323 <macro-end-do-stmt> <<is>> MACRO END DO

   A macro DO construct iterates the expansion of its enclosed macro body
   block at macro expansion time.  The number of iterations is determined
   by the values of the expanded macro expressions in the MACRO DO statement.

   R329 <macro-condition> <<is>> <macro-expr>

   C3nn (R329) A macro condition shall expand to an expression of type logical.

   A macro IF construct provides conditional expansion of its enclosed macro
   body blocks at macro expansion time.  Whether the enclosed macro body
   blocks contribute to the macro expansion is determined by the logical
   value of the expanded macro expressions in the MACRO IF and MACRO ELSE IF
   statements.

   R330 <macro-body-stmt> <<is>> <result-token> [ <result-token> ]... [ && ]

   C3nn (R327) The first <result-token> shall not be MACRO unless the second
        <result-token> is not a keyword or name.

   R331 <result-token> <<is>> <token> [ %% <token> ]...

   Constraint: The concatenated textual <token>s in a <result-token> shall have
               the form of a lexical token.

   R332 <token> is any lexical token including labels, keywords, and
        semi-colon.

   Constraint: && shall not appear in the last <macro-body-stmt> of a macro
               definition.

   Constraint: When a macro is expanded, the last <macro-body-stmt> processed
               shall not end with &&.

   R333 <end-macro-stmt> <<is>> END MACRO [ <macro-name> ]

   Constraint: The <macro-name> in the END MACRO statement shall be the same as
               the <macro-name> in the DEFINE MACRO statement.

   R334 <macro-expr> <<is>> <basic-token-sequence>

   C3nn (R334) A <macro-expr> shall expand to a scalar initialization
        expression.

   Macro expressions are used to control the behavior of the MACRO DO and
   MACRO IF constructs when a macro is being expanded.  The type, type
   parameters, and value of a macro expression are determined when that macro
   expression is expanded."

{NOTE: This is because we (obviously) need to plug macro arguments and macro
 local variable values into macro expressions.  It does seriously limit the
 amount of checking that can be done at macro definition time.}

  "3.5.2 Macro expansion"

{Note: I have subdivided this section to give it better structure.
       It is perhaps unfortunate that the division into definition and
       expansion keeps the BNF away from the syntax of its effects.}

  "3.5.2.1 General

   Macro expansion is the conceptual replacement of the EXPAND statement with
   the Fortran statements that it produces.  The semantics of an EXPAND
   statement are those of the Fortran statements that it produces.  It is
   recommended that a processor be capable of displaying the results of macro
   expansion.  It is processor-dependent whether comments in a macro definition
   appear in the expansion.  It is processor-dependent whether continuations
   and consecutive blanks that are not part of a token are preserved.

   The process of macro expansion produces Fortran statements consisting of
   tokens.  The combined length of the tokens for a single statement, plus
   inter-token spacing, shall not be greater than 256*130 characters. If a
   statement contains any character that is not of default kind, the maximum
   number of characters allowed is processor dependent.

   \begin{note}
   This length is so that the result of macro expansion can be formed into
   valid free form Fortran source, consisting of an initial line and 255
   continuation lines, times 130 which allows for beginning and ending
   continuation characters (&) on each line.

   Also, breaking tokens across continuation lines in macro definitions and in
   EXPAND statements does not affect macro expansion: it is as if they were
   joined together before replacement.
   \end{note}

   R334 <expand-stmt> <<is>> EXPAND <macro-name>
                             [ ( <macro-actual-arg-list> ) ]

   C3nn (R334) <macro-name> shall be the name of a macro that was previously
        defined or accessed via use or host association.

   C3nn (R334) The macro shall expand to a sequence or zero or more complete
        Fortran statements.

   C3nn (R334) The statements produced by a macro expansion shall conform to
        the syntax rules and constraints as if they physically replaced the
	EXPAND statement prior to program processing.

   C3nn (R334) The statements produced by a macro expansion shall not include
        a statement which ends the scoping unit containing the EXPAND statement.

   C3nn (R334) If a macro expansion produces a statement which begins a new
        scoping unit, it shall also produce a statement which ends that scoping
        unit.

   C3nn (R334) If the EXPAND statement appears as the <action-stmt> of an
        <if-stmt>, it shall expand to exactly one <action-stmt> that is not
        an <if-stmt>, <end-program-stmt>, <end-function-stmt>, or
        <end-subroutine-stmt>.

   \obs{
   C3nn (R334) If the EXPAND statement appears as a <do-term-action-stmt>, it
        shall expand to exactly one <action-stmt> that is not a
        <continue-stmt>, a <goto-stmt>, a <return-stmt>, a <stop-stmt>, an
        <exit-stmt>, a <cycle-stmt>, an <end-function-stmt>, an
        <end-subroutine-stmt>, an <end-program-stmt>, or an
        <arithmetic-if-stmt>.
   }

   C3nn (R334) If the EXPAND statement has a label, the expansion of the macro
        shall produce at least one statement, and the first statement produced
        shall not have a label.

   C3nn (R334) A <macro-actual-arg> shall appear corresponding to each
        nonoptional macro dummy argument.

   C3nn (R334) At most one <macro-actual-arg> shall appear corresponding to
        each optional macro dummy argument.

   Expansion of a macro is performed by the EXPAND statement.  If the EXPAND
   statement has a label, the label is interpreted after expansion as belonging
   to the first statement of the expansion.

                                  <macro-actual-arg-value>

   C3nn (R335) <macro-dummy-name> shall be the name of a macro dummy argument
        of the macro being expanded.

   C3nn (R334) The <macro-dummy-name>= shall not be omitted unless it has been
               omitted from each preceding <macro-actual-arg> in the
               <expand-stmt>.

   R336 <macro-actual-arg-value> <<is>> <basic-token-sequence>

   R337 <basic-token-sequence> <<is>> <basic-token>

                               <<or>> <basic-token> <basic-token-sequence>

   R338 <basic-token> is any lexical token except comma, parentheses, array
                         constructor delimiters, and semi-colon.

   R340 <arg-token> <<is>> <basic-token>
                    <<or>> ,

   Macro expansion processes any macro declarations of the macro definition,
   and then expands its macro body block.  Any macro expressions in
   <macro-type-spec>s are evaluated and the kinds of the macro variables thereby
   declared are determined for that particular expansion.

   Macro expansion of a macro body block processes each macro body construct of
   the macro body block in turn, starting with the first macro body construct
   and ending with the last macro body construct.

   Expansion of a statement within a macro body construct consists of three
   steps:
   (1) token replacement,
   (2) token concatenation, and
   (3) statement-dependent processing.

   Token replacement replaces each token of a macro body statement or macro
   expression that is a macro local variable with the value of that variable.
   In a macro expression, a reference to the PRESENT intrinsic function with
   a macro dummy argument name as its actual argument is replaced by the
   token \cf{.TRUE.} if the specified macro dummy argument is present, and
   the token \cf{.FALSE.} if the specified macro dummy argument is not present.
   Otherwise, the value of a macro dummy argument that is present is the
   sequence of tokens from the corresponding actual argument.  The value of a
   macro dummy argument that is not present is a zero-length token sequence.
   The value of an integer macro variable is its minimal-length decimal
   representation; if negative this will produce two tokens, a minus sign and
   an unsigned integer literal constant.

   Token concatenation is performed with the %% operator, which is only
   permitted inside a macro definition.  After expansion, each sequence of
   single tokens separated by %% operators is replaced by a single token
   consisting of the concatenated text of the sequence of tokens.  The result
   of a concatenation shall be a valid Fortran token, and may be a different
   kind of token from one or more of the original sequence of tokens.

   Note 3.xx
   For example, the sequence
     3 %% .14159 %% E %% + %% 0
   forms the single real literal constant 3.14159E0.

   3.5.2.2 Macro body statements

   Processing a macro body statement produces a whole or partial Fortran
   statement.  A macro body statement that is either the first macro body
   statement processed by this macro expansion or the next macro body statement
   processed after a macro body statement that did not end with the
   continuation generation operator &&, is an initial macro body statement.
   The next macro body statement processed after a macro body statement that
   ends with && is a continuation macro body statement.  An initial macro body
   statement that does not end with && produces a whole Fortran statement
   consisting of its token sequence.  All other macro body statements produce
   partial Fortran statements, and the sequence of tokens starting with those
   produced by the initial macro body statement and appending the tokens
   produced by each subsequent continuation macro body statement form a Fortran
   statement.  The && operators are not included in the token sequence.

   3.5.2.3 The macro DO construct

   The macro DO construct specifies the repeated expansion of a macro body
   block.  Processing the macro DO statement performs the following steps in
   sequence:"
{Note: The following insertion is the literal LaTeX source, taken from the c08
 DO loop description with modifications.}
  "\begin{enum}
   \item
   The initial parameter $m_1$, the terminal parameter $m_2$, and the
   incrementation parameter $m_3$ are of type integer with the same kind type
   parameter as the \si{macro-do-variable-name}.  Their values are
   given by the first \si{macro-expr}, the second \si{macro-expr}, and the
   third \si{macro-expr} of the \si{macro-do-stmt} respectively, including, if
   necessary, conversion to the kind type parameter of the
   \si{macro-do-variable-name} according to the rules for numeric conversion
   (Table \ref{T:Numeric conversion and the assignment statement}).  If the
   third \si{macro-expr} does not appear, $m_3$ has the value 1.  The
   value of $m_3$ shall not be zero.

  \item The macro DO variable becomes defined with the value of the initial
  parameter $m_1$.

  \item The \tdef{iteration count} is established and is the value of the
  expression $(m_2-m_1 + m_3) / m_3$, unless that value is negative, in
  which case the iteration count is 0.

  \end{enum}

  After this, the following steps are performed repeatedly until processing
  of the macro DO construct is finished:

  \begin{enum}
  \item

  The iteration count is tested.  If it is zero, the loop terminates and
  processing of the macro DO construct is finished.

  \item
  If the iteration count is nonzero, the macro body block of the macro DO
  construct is expanded.

  \item
  The iteration count is decremented by one.
  The macro DO variable is incremented by the value of the incrementation
  parameter $m_3$.
  \end{enum}

  3.5.3.4 The MACRO IF construct

  The MACRO IF construct provides conditional expansion of macro body
  blocks.  At most one of the macro body blocks of the macro IF construct is
  expanded.  The macro conditions of the construct are evaluated in order until
  a true value is found or a MACRO ELSE or MACRO END IF statement is
  encountered.  If a true value or a MACRO ELSE statement is found, the macro
  body block immediately following is expanded and this completes the
  processing of the construct.  If none of the evaluated conditions is true and
  there is no MACRO ELSE statement, the processing of the construct is
  completed without expanding any of the macro body blocks within the
  construct."

  "3.5.3.5 Macro definitions

   Processing a macro definition defines a new macro.  If a macro definition is
   produced by a macro expansion, all of the statements of the produced macro
   definition have token replacement and concatenation applied to them before
   the new macro is defined.

   3.5.2.6 Examples

   Note 3.nn
   This is a macro which loops over an array of any rank and processes each
   array element.

   DEFINE MACRO loop_over(array,rank,traceinfo)
     MACRO INTEGER :: i
       BLOCK
     MACRO DO i=1,rank
         INTEGER loop_over_temp_%%i
     MACRO END DO
     MACRO DO i=1,rank
         DO loop_over_temp_%%i=1,size(array,i)
     MACRO END DO
           CALL impure_scalar_procedure(array(loop_over_temp_%%1 &&
     MACRO DO i=2,rank
                                             ,loop_over_temp%i &&
     MACRO END DO
                                              ),traceinfo)
     MACRO DO i=1,rank
         END DO
     MACRO END DO
       END BLOCK
   END MACRO

   Note 3.nn
   One can effectively pass macro names as macro arguments, since expansion
   of arguments occurs before analysis of each macro body statement.  For
   example:
      DEFINE MACRO :: iterator(count,operation)
        DO i=1,count
          EXPAND operation(i)
        END DO
      END MACRO

      DEFINE MACRO :: process_element(j)
        READ *,a(j)
        result(j) = process(a(j))
        IF (j>1) PRINT *,'difference =',result(j)-result(j-1)
      END MACRO

      EXPAND iterator(17,process_element)

  This expands into 17 sets of 3 statements:

        READ *,a(1)
        result(1) = process(a(1))
        IF (1>1) PRINT *,'difference =',result(1)-result(1-1)
        READ *,a(2)
        result(2) = process(a(2))
        IF (2>1) PRINT *,'difference =',result(2)-result(2-1)
        ...
        READ *,a(17)
        result(17) = process(a(17))
        IF (17>1) PRINT *,'difference =',result(17)-result(17-1)

   Note 3.nn
   Using the ability to evaluate initialization expressions under macro control
   and test them, one can create interfaces and procedures for all kinds of a
   type, for example:

   DEFINE MACRO :: i_square_procs()
     MACRO INTEGER i
     MACRO DO i=1,1000
       MACRO IF (SELECTED_INT_KIND(i)>=0 .AND.
                 (i==1 .OR. SELECTED_INT_KIND(i)/=SELECTED_INT_KIND(i-1))) THEN
           FUNCTION i_square_range_%%i(a) RESULT(r)
             INTEGER(SELECTED_INT_KIND(i)) a,r
             r = a**2
           END FUNCTION
         MACRO END IF
       MACRO END DO
     END MACRO"

    "The macro local variables of a macro definition have the scope of the
     macro definition.  If a global or local identifier accessible in the
     scoping unit of a macro definition is the same as a macro dummy argument,
     the name is interpreted within the macro definition as that of the macro
     dummy argument.  Elsewhere in the scoping unit, the name is interpreted as
     the global or local identifier."
{The macro local variables have the scope of the construct, i.e. they shall be
 construct entities.}

NOTE TO THE EDITOR: Factor out this boilerplate everywhere it occurs, replacing
                    it with a single paragraph stating
  "If a global or local identifier is the same as a construct entity, the name
   is interpreted within the construct as that of the construct entity.
   Elsewhere in the scoping unit, the name is interpreted as the global or
   local identifier."
{This is at [406:2-5] and [406:11-14].  Note that the FORALL statement part of
 [406:2-5] was already redundant with [405:37-40].}

[411:8] 16.4.1.3 Host association, first paragraph, last sentence,
  before "and namelist groups" insert "macros,".
{Macros shall be accessible via (both use and) host association.}
NOTE TO THE EDITOR: immediately before this, delete the pointless cross-ref for
  "generic identifiers".  We don't have cross-refs for anything else in the
  list, and "generic identifiers" appears in the index already.
NOTE TO THE EDITOR: The first two sentences of this paragraph are wrong.  Host
  association applies to identifiers, not just names (both these sentences say
  "named entities").  Fix, perhaps by incorporating the last sentence into the
  first and then we can just say "accessed entities" throughout the rest.  This
  is basically how we do it for use assoc...

[411:29+] 16.4.1.3, numbered list, insert new item near the end
  "(14a) The name of a macro".
{Local macro definitions have to block host association.}

[429:11] Annex A, entry for "entity", add macros to the list.
{This is helpful, but not necessary.  I'll remind people that Annex A is not
 normative, and any "definition" therein is not a definition, just a helpful
 hint or reminder of what we mean.  As it happens, "entity" is a formal and
 very general way of saying "thing"... and macros are of course "things" in the
 most general sense.}

6. Possibly better examples?

If anyone has any better example, e.g. like

    (a) use macros to create modules,
    (b) use macros to create types and procedures, and
    (c) use macros to create inline sections of code conveniently (like an
        inline procedure call),

please make a suggestion.
