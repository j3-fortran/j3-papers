1. Introduction

This paper accepts some of the editorial changes suggested in 12-105
and rejects others.

With regards to cross-references, the policy is not to insert these
when it is clear or nearby.  A cross-reference breaks up the flow of
the prose; this has a negative effect on comprehension and visual
searchability.


2. Edits to 10-007r1

Index "label" as "see statement label" instead of having a separate list
of pages.

[44:22] 3.2.5p3, After "Any statement may",
	"have" -> "begin with".
{A statement label is at the beginning of a statement, but the statement
 might "have" other labels inside it.}

[46:29] 3.3.2.6p1, index "statement label" here.
{Placement of statement labels in free form is important information.}

[47:24] 3.3.3.5p1, index "statement label" here.
{Placement of statement labels in fixed form is important information.}

[105:41] 5.4.7p9 After "data-pointer-initialization compatible"
	 insert "(4.5.4.6)"
	 viz "(\ref{Default initialization for components})".
{This horrible term is indexed, but since we are some distance away and
 it is important to the sentence, a cross-reference is useful.}

[150:17-18] 7.1.11p2(17), if it will fit on the line,
	    "contai-ning"->"contain-ing".
{LaTeX's auto-hyphenation is sometimes worse than useless.}


3. Rejected edits

[44:22] Insert cross references ... to make it easier to find where
        label declarations appear.
{This is clear enough as is, it is not needed here.}

[66:32] 4.5.4 C446, Insert a cross reference for "specification
        function (7.1.11)" or make it a hot link.
{That is unnecessary and would inappropriately draw attention to a
 minor aspect of the constraint.}

[66:41] 4.5.4 C450, Insert a cross reference for "specification
        function (7.1.11)" or make it a hot link.
{That is unnecessary and would inappropriately draw attention to a
 minor aspect of the constraint.}

[70:1] C460, After "data-pointer-initialization compatible"
       Insert "(4.5.4.6)".
{It is completely inappropriate to insert a cross-reference from one
 subclause to itself.}

[151:27] 7.1.12p1(4), Insert a cross ref for "specification inquiry"
         or make it a hot link.
{No.  It refers to the previous subclause and is clearly to do with
 specification expressions (that subclause).  It is also indexed.}
