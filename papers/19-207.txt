Subject: User notification of system and library exceptions

Reference: 18-133r2

Introduction
------------

When users were surveyed as to what new features they wanted in Fortran,
"exceptions" was a vey popular choice, second only to "templates/generics".
"Exceptions" is one of the "large" features on the WG5 work item list. But
what, exactly, is wanted here and how can it be made to play well with
Fortran?

Many languages have some form of exception handling built in, but when J3
started discussing possible approaches, it became clear that any approach
that involved changing control flow or "fixing up" the result of an
operation, would encounter strong resistance. There was also strong
opposition to any change that would seriously degrade run-time performance.
Also, some of the proposals would be very difficult to implement.

Paper 18-133r2 enumerates various use cases for exception handling:

1) Errors from library calls
2) Software testing frameworks
3) Software contracts
4) System-generated errors

This paper proposes a somewhat simpler approach that directly addresses
use cases 1 and 4, and could be useful for cases 2 and 3. The notions of
changing control flow ("long jumps") or fixups are excluded. This proposal
enables notification of a user routine when an error condition occurs.

The proposal is modeled, somewhat, on the OpenVMS Common Language
Environment nested exception handling mechanism. The names of keywords in
this proposal are inspired by those in OpenVMS but are just placeholders
here; they may change when/if the proposal is fleshed out.

This paper is intended to serve as a high-level concept, not detailed
specification nor syntax. The advantage of this approach is that the only
run-time cost is when establishing the handler and an extra call when an
error condition has been detected. No other changes to normally executing
code are needed.

Outline of Proposal
-------------------

Add an intrinsic subroutine ESTABLISH whose purpose is to register a user
error handler.

ESTABLISH (NEW_HANDLER, NEW_CONTEXT[, PREV_HANDLER, PREV_CONTEXT,
STATUS, ERRMSG])

NEW_HANDLER - shall be an external function with an interface as
PROCEDURE(HANDLER_INT) where HANDLER_INT is an abstract interface declared
in intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV

NEW_CONTEXT - shall be a scalar of some useful type. For this paper,
INTEGER(C_INTPTR_T) is used. It is INTENT(IN)

PREV_HANDLER (optional) - shall be POINTER, PROCEDURE(HANDLER_INT). It is
INTENT(OUT)

PREV_CONTEXT (optional) - shall be a scalar of the same type and kind as
NEW_CONTEXT. It is INTENT(OUT)

STATUS (optional) shall be a scalar of type integer with a decimal
exponent range of at least four. It is an INTENT (OUT) argument. It is
assigned a processor-dependent positive value if the registration fails.
Otherwise it is assigned the value 0.

ERRMSG (optional) shall be a default character scalar. It is an
INTENT (INOUT) argument. It is assigned a processor-dependent explanatory
message if the registration fails. Otherwise, it is unchanged.

The use of INTEGER(C_INTPTR_T) might be replaced with some type added to
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.

ESTABLISH registers NEW_HANDLER as an error handler for the current image,
and saves NEW_CONTEXT to be passed to the handler when it is called.

If PREV_HANDLER and/or PREV_CONTEXT are present, they are assigned the
handler procedure and context, if any, that were registered at the
time of the call. If no such handler was registered, PREV_HANDLER is
nullified and PREV_CONTEXT is assigned zero.

The following abstract interface is defined in ISO_FORTRAN_ENV:

ABSTRACT INTERFACE
  FUNCTION HANDLER_INT (STATUS, ERRMSG, SEVERITY, PROGRAM_HANDLES,
     CONTEXT)
    USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_C_BINDING
    INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: STATUS
    CHARACTER(*), INTENT(IN) :: ERRMSG
    LOGICAL, INTENT(IN) :: CONTINUABLE
    LOGICAL, INTENT(IN) :: PROGRAM_HANDLES
    INTEGER(C_INTPTR_T), INTENT(IN) :: CONTEXT
  END FUNCTION HANDLER_INT
END INTERFACE

When a condition occurs that would otherwise trigger some sort of
run-time handling (anything that would set an IOSTAT or STATUS
value to non-zero), the currently registered handler procedure (if any)
is called before the default processing (display an error, stop
execution, take an ERR= branch, etc.) The arguments passed to the
handler procedure are as follows:

STATUS - the integer value that would be assigned to an IOSTAT= or
STATUS= variable

ERRMSG - a processor-dependent explanatory message

CONTINUABLE - True if execution can continue, false if not

PROGRAM_HANDLES - True if the program supplies an error-handling
keyword such as ERR=, EOF=, IOSTAT= STAT=, or STATUS=, if applicable.
Otherwise, false. Not all conditions may result from operations
that allow such keywords.

CONTEXT - the context registered along with the handler

The user procedure may choose to display its own message, show
a traceback, log the error, or do nothing.

Result characteristics - default logical scalar

The handler function should return true if it "handled" the error.
This tells the processor to not display its own message, but
other processing as specified in the standard should proceed.
If the handler returns false, this signifies that the error
was not handled and the processor should take its default action.

Other Procedures
----------------

Procedures could be added to:
- Retrieve the current handler and context, if any
- Invoke the current handler and context, if any (useful
  for libraries)

  --END--
