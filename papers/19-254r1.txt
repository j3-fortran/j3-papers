Description. Parse a string into tokens.

Class: Subroutine.

Arguments.

STRING   shall be a scalar of type CHARACTER. It is an INTENT(IN)
         argument.  The SPLIT intrinsic will scan STRING, identifying
         tokens as described in the description of SET.

SET      shall be a scalar of type CHARACTER of the same kind as
         STRING. It is an INTENT(IN) argument.  Every character
         in SET is a token delimiter. Two consecutive token
         delimiters in STRING, or a token delimiter in the first
         or last character in STRING, indicate a null (zero-length)
         token. A sequence of zero or more characters in STRING
         delimited by any token delimiter, or the  beginning or end
         of STRING, comprise a token.

TOKENS   shall be of type CHARACTER of the same kind as STRING.
         It is an INTENT(OUT) argument.  It shall be an allocatable 
         array with deferred length. When TOKENS is present, every
         token found in STRING is assigned, in the order found, to 
         the next element of TOKENS.  

         Every element of TOKENS has the length of the longest token
         found, and SIZE(TOKENS) is the number of tokens found.  The
         elements of TOKENS are blank padded as needed. If the blank
         character was not one of the token delimiters in SET, then
         the form of SPLIT that returns FIRST and LAST may be more
         useful.

SEPARATOR (optional) shall be of type CHARACTER of the same kind
         as STRING. It is an INTENT(OUT) argument.  

         When TOKENS, or FIRST and LAST, are present, SEPARATOR, if
         present, shall be an allocatable array with deferred length,
         and the token  delimiter which separated TOKENS(i) from
         TOKENS(i+1), if any, is returned in SEPARATOR(i).  Note that
         when BACK is present and TRUE, SEPARATOR(i) is the token
         delimiter character, if any, that appeared immediately
         before the token stored in TOKENS(i). 

         When POS and SEPARATOR are present, SEPARATOR shall be a
         scalar, and is assigned the value of a token delimiter as
         described in 1) and 2) below when a token delimiter was found,
         and is not assigned a value when no token delimiter
         was found.
           1) When BACK is not present, or present with the value
              FALSE, the token delimiter that appeared immediately
              after the identified token, if any, is assigned to
              SEPARATOR.
           2) When BACK is present with the value TRUE, the token 
              delimiter that appeared before the identified
              token, if any, is assigned to SEPARATOR.

FIRST    shall be an allocatable array of type integer
         It is an INTENT(OUT) argument.

LAST     shall be an allocatable array of type integer
         It is an INTENT(OUT) argument.

         When FIRST and LAST are present, they are assigned the 
         offsets in STRING such that STRING(FIRST(i):LAST(i))is the
         ith token found.  When the ith token is a zero length token,
         LAST(i) will be FIRST(i)-1.

POS      shall be a scalar of type INTEGER. It is an INTENT(INOUT)
         argument.

         When POS is present, and BACK is not present or present
         with the value FALSE, the token beginning at
         STRING(POS+1:POS+1) is identified, and if that token was
         not the last token in STRING, POS is set to the position
         of the separator character that appeared immediately after
         the identified token.  When the identified token was the
         last token in STRING, POS is set to LEN(STRING)+1. When
         SPLIT is invoked with POS<LEN(STRING), the identified token
         is STRING(IPOS+1:OPOS-1) where IPOS is the value of POS
         passed into SPLIT and OPOS is the value of POS after SPLIT 
         returns. So when SPLIT is being used to find all tokens
         in STRING, POS should be set to zero for the first call
         to SPLIT, and when the value returned in POS is > LEN(STRING),
         the last token in STRING has been found.  When POS is present
         and no token is identified, POS is not modified.

         When POS is present, and BACK is present with the value TRUE,
         the token ending at STRING(POS-1:POS-1) is identified,
         and if that token was not the first token in STRING, POS is
         set to the position of the separator character that appeared
         immediately before the identified token.  When the identified
         token was the first token in STRING, POS is set to 0. When
         SPLIT is invoked with POS<LEN(STRING)+1, the identified token
         is STRING(OPOS+1:IPOS-1) where IPOS is the value of POS
         passed into SPLIT and OPOS is the value of POS after SPLIT 
         returns. So when SPLIT is being used to find all tokens
         in STRING, POS should be set to LEN(STRING)+1 for the first
         call to SPLIT, and when the value returned in POS is zero,
         the last token in STRING has been found.  When POS is present
         and no token is identified, POS is not modified.

BACK     (optional) shall be a scalar of type LOGICAL. It is an
         INTENT(IN) argument. STRING is scanned for tokens beginning
         with the first character in STRING, unless BACK is present
         with the value of TRUE, in which case STRING is scanned
         beginning with the last character.

When LEN(STRING) is zero, SPLIT will allocate TOKENS, FIRST, and LAST
as zero size arrays.

Examples.
  
  CHARACTER( LEN= :), ALLOCATABLE :: STRING
  CHARACTER( LEN= :), ALLOCATABLE, DIMENSION(:) :: TOKENS
  CHARACTER( LEN= 2) :: SET = ',;'
  STRING = 'first,second,third'
  CALL SPLIT( STRING, TOKENS, SET)
  PRINT *, TOKENS

  will print
    firstsecondthird

  CHARACTER( LEN= :), ALLOCATABLE :: STRING
  CHARACTER( LEN= 2) :: SET = ',;'
  INTEGER, DIMENSION(:):: FIRST, LAST
  STRING = 'first,second,,forth'
  CALL SPLIT( STRING, SET, FIRST, LAST)
  PRINT *, FIRST
  PRINT *, LAST

  will print the values
    1 7 14 15
    5 12 13 19

Example 3:
  CHARACTER( LEN= :), ALLOCATABLE :: INPUT
  CHARACTER( LEN= 2) :: SET = ', '
  INTEGER P
  INPUT = "one,last example"
  P = 0
  DO
     IF( P > LEN( INPUT) ) EXIT
     ISTART = P + 1
     CALL SPLIT(INPUT, SET, P)
     IEND = P - 1
     PRINT *, INPUT( ISTART: IEND)
  END DO

  will print
    one
    last
    example
