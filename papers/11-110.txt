The Fortran sub-committee of the MPI-3 Forum would like to define the
MPI Fortran interface with explicit interfaces. To ease the
implementation of portable MPI libraries, it would be helpful if this
interface can be defined as BIND(C). With BIND(C), the MPI library can
be implemented portably across different Fortran compilers.  For
backward-compatibility reasons, it is essential to guarantee that
existing MPI programs still run with MPI libraries based on the new
Fortran 2003 compatible MPI interface specification.

To achieve this goal, all existing intrinsic types (with default kind
parameter) should be usable as an actual arguments in routines defined
with BIND(C), Unfortunately, intrinsic Fortran types with default kind
parameter may not be interoperable.

For example, the following interface,

INTERFACE
   SUBROUTINE example(mpi_tag) BIND(C)
      INTEGER :: mpi_tag
END INTERFACE

when compiled with gfortran gives the warning,

   "Warning: Variable 'i' at (1) is a parameter to the BIND(C)
    procedure 'example' but may not be C interoperable"

The problem is that there is no defined C type corresponding to a
fortran default INTEGER, only with INTEGER(C_INT).  This problem could
be easily resolved by supplying typedefs in ISO_Fortran_binding.h, for
example CFI_integer_t.  The C implementation of the interface could cast
to whatever size C integer is appropriate for the implementation.

Currently, C types play a dominant role.  One can interoperate with a C
int from Fortran by using INTEGER(C_INT) from Fortran.  But symmetry
doesn't hold in that one can't let Fortran types play the dominant role;
one can't interoperate with a default Fortran INTEGER from C.  One might
widh to define the example function in C as follows:

void example(CFI_integer_t mpi_tag)
{
  // a C int will hold an mpi_tag so cast it to int
  int tag = (int) mpi_tag;
  return use_mpi_tag(tag);
}

The CFI_integer_t can be typedef'd in ISO_Fortran_binding.h as, for
example,

#ifdef VENDOR_INTEGER_PROMOTED
 typedef long CFI_integer_t;
#else
 typedef int CFI_integer_t;
#endif

This allows C files to be compiled with, for example,

gcc -DVENDOR_INTEGER_PROMOTED example.c

to complement Fortran compiler options that promote variables.

It might be desirable to standardize the macro VENDOR_INTEGER_PROMOTED,
though edits are not provided to do this.


EDITS

Section 15.2.2: Insert the following sentence at the end of paragraph 1:

  The C types, CFI_integer_t, CFI_real_t, CFI_double_real_t,
  CFI_complex_t, CFI_double_complex_t, CFI_logical_t, and
  CFI_character_t listed in the third column of table 15.2 are defined
  in ISO_Fortran_binding.h.

Section 15.2.2: Insert the following sentence at the end of paragraph 2:

  The value of F_DEFAULT_INTEGER shall be a valid value for an integer
  kind parameter on the processor if the corresponding C type
  CFI_integer_t exists on the companion processor or -2 otherwise.

Section 15.2.2: Insert the following paragraph after paragraph 3:

  The values of F_DEFAULT_REAL and F_DEFAULT_DOUBLE_REAL shall each be a
  valid value for a real kind parameter on the processor if the
  corresponding C type CFI_real_t or CFI_double_real_t exists on the
  companion processor or -4 otherwise.  The values of F_DEFAULT_COMPLEX
  and F_DEFAULT_DOUBLE_COMPLEX shall each be a valid value for a real
  kind parameter on the processor if the corresponding C type
  CFI_complex_t or CFI_double_complex_t exists on the companion
  processor or -4 otherwise.

Section 15.2.2: Insert the following sentence at the end of paragraph 4:

  The value of F_DEFAULT_LOGICAL shall be a valid value for a logical
  kind parameter on the processor if the corresponding C type
  CFI_logical_t exists on the companion processor or -2 otherwise.

Section 15.2.2: Insert the following sentence at the end of paragraph 5:

  The value of F_DEFAULT_CHARACTER shall be a valid value for a
  character kind type parameter on the processor if the corresponding C
  type CFI_character_t exists on the companion processor or -2
  otherwise.


Section 15.3.2, Table 15.2: Insert the following lines in Table 15.2 at
the appropriate location.

integer                 F_DEFAULT_INTEGER             CFI_integer_t
real                    F_DEFAULT_REAL                CFI_real_t
real                    F_DEFAULT_DOUBLE_REAL         CFI_double_real_t
complex                 F_DEFAULT_COMPLEX             CFI_complex_t

character               F_DEFAULT_CHARACTER           CFI_character_t

Section 15.3.2, paragraph 3: Replace the last line in paragraph 3 by,

  The C types mentioned in table 15.2 are defined in
  ISO_Fortran_binding.h or in subclauses 6.2.5, 7.17, and 7.18.1 of
  ISO/IEC 9899:1999.
