Subject: C_SIZEOF and null pointers F18/026 revisited
Date: 2022-March-02

Reference: 18-007r1, 20-151, 21-134r2

Consider the following program:

program p
 use iso_c_binding
 implicit none
 integer(c_int), pointer :: int_s
 integer(c_int), pointer :: int_a(:)
 print *, c_sizeof (c_null_ptr) ! (A)
 print *, c_sizeof (null ())    ! (B)
 print *, c_sizeof (null (int_s)) ! (C)
 print *, c_sizeof (null (int_a)) ! (D)
end

By the current text in 18-007r1, (A) is valid because its argument
is "an interoperable data entity that is not an assumed-size array or an
assumed-rank array that is associated with an assumed-size array"
(18.2.3.7p3). (B),(C) and (D) are not valid because the arguments have the
POINTER attribute and are thus not interoperable (18.3.4p1).

Interp F18/026, passed by J3 at m224, made (C) valid because the
prohibition on pointers was removed and the argument does have
interoperable type and type parameters. Even though the pointer is
disassociated, C_SIZEOF returns the size of an object of that type.

(D) is now problematic because C_SIZEOF needs to know the number of
elements in its argument, and what it is given is a disassociated pointer
for which that is undefined.

(B) is similarly undefined. When supplied as an actual argument, NULL()
takes on the "characteristics of the corresponding dummy argument"
(16.9.144 Table 16.5), but the dummy argument of C_SIZEOF has no specific
characteristics.

21-134r2 discussed the POINTER issue, but did not consider the case of
a disassociated pointer nor the NULL() intrinsic as an argument to
C_SIZEOF.

NUMBER: F18/026
TITLE: C_SIZEOF argument
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the example
    SUBROUTINE test(b)
      USE iso_c_binding
      REAL(c_double) b(:),a(SIZE(b))
      PRINT *,c_sizeof(a)               ! A
      PRINT *,c_sizeof(b)               ! B
      PRINT *,c_sizeof(a(::2))          ! C
      PRINT *,c_sizeof(a+1)             ! D
      PRINT *,c_sizeof(1.0_c_double)    ! E
    END SUBROUTINE

18.2.3.7 C_SIZEOF (X) states
    "X shall be an interoperable data entity..."

According to that, the reference to C_SIZEOF marked A is valid, as A
is interoperable (an explicit-shape array of interoperable type and
type parameters). And the reference marked B is invalid, as only
explicit-shape arrays and assumed-size arrays are interoperable, thus
assumed-shape arrays are definitely not.

For the references at C and D, the standard seems to be silent on the
matter of whether they are interoperable. It is clear for named
variables, but although subobject designators can denote variables,
they are not names, and expressions are not variables at all. Being
silent implies non-conformance as no interpretation is established.

The reference at E also appears to be non-conforming, as the standard
specifies no criteria for interoperability of expressions.

However, the description of the result of C_SIZEOF only makes use of
the interoperability of the type and type parameters.

Are these references intended to be conforming?
If not, should the standard be clarified to say that X shall be an
interoperable named variable?

ANSWER:

Yes, these references were all intended to be conforming.
An edit is supplied to correct this mistake, with an addition to
require that any pointer or allocatable argument be associated or
allocated.

EDIT to 18-007r1:

[473:27] 18.2.3.7 C_SIZEOF (X), p3 Argument,
  Replace the paragraph with:

   "Argument. X shall be of interoperable type and type parameters,
    and shall not be an assumed-size array, an assumed-rank array
    that is associated with an assumed-size array, an unallocated
    allocatable variable, or a pointer that is not associated."
{Loosen the requirements.}
