   Bill is working on the module for MPICH2;  Craig Rasmussen is working
   on it for OpenMPI.  Unfortunately it still uses default integer.

   MPI 4 work continues on resiliency - some processes failing doesn't
   crash the entire application.

   support for F2003 and for coprocessors {OMP TARGET}.

   Draft Minutes of the PL22.3 US TAG meeting
     {200th meeting since founding by ANSI/CBEMA as X3J3}

   Thursday, February 14, 2013

   Fairfield Inn Las Vegas Airport
   3850 South Paradise Road
   Las Vegas, NV 89109


   The meeting was called to order by Van Snyder, International
   Representative, at 4:15 PM PT.

   There were 6 members present from a total membership of 7.  The
   members, the attendees, and the organizations they represent
   are listed in the table below as column 1.

   Excerpts from the RD-2

     4.3.4 Quorum 
       Quorum for INCITS and its subgroups is defined accordingly: 
         a. For the Executive Board, quorum is a majority of the
            voting membership. 
         b. For SGs there is no minimum attendance required for quorum. 
         c. For all other INCITS Organization Entities, quorum is
            one-third of the voting membership with at least four
            voting members present. 

     4.4.2.2 2/3 Voting Rule
       The 2/3 voting rule is defined as: 
         • approval by at least 2/3 of those voting YES or NO, and 
         • approval by a majority of the voting membership. That
           threshold is not affected by the number of members
           present at the meeting for a meeting vote.
