A. Introduction
---------------

This document lists the technical issues raised by the editor with the
current working document, standing document 007.

Issues are separated into two lists; the resolved ones and the unresolved
ones.  When an issue is resolved, the J3 note in SD-007 will be deleted and
the item moved from the unresolved list to the resolved list.  Issue
numbers will not be reused.

The one-line description is just a hint as to the issue, not a
comprehensive statement of it.


B. Unresolved issues

008. Is the processor required to define a nonnegative type specifier value
     for the above cases?
     Feature: Further C interop (TS).
     Added in: 14-007r1 as a result of processing N1942.

012. Term "actual argument" wrong, nonsensical "effective argument".
     Feature: Further C interop (TS).

     Resolved in 15-007 by 14-197r2.

005. An effective argument is not EVER an address.
     Feature: Further C interop (TS).
     Added in: 14-007r1 as a result of processing N1942.
     Resolved in 15-007r1 by 15-113r3.

006. An interoperable procedure written in Fortran does not even have any
     formal parameter, so it cannot have the value of a null pointer.
     Feature: Further C interop (TS).
     Added in: 14-007r1 as a result of processing N1942.
     Resolved in 15-007 by 14-197r2.

007. Fortran objects do not have a "host instance".
     Feature: Further C interop (TS).
