ANSWER:

The answer to question 1 is yes, since each valid real kind type parameter value 
characterizes a representation method for an approximation method (4.3.1.2). 

Clause 1.4 says
   'This standard does not specify ...
   (6) The physical properties of the representation of quantities and the   
   method of rounding, approximating, or computing numeric values on a  
   particular processor,
   ...'
The processor is therefore free to use different precision for intermediate real 
calculations, which answers all the other questions.
