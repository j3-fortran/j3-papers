Date:       January 21, 1997
To:         X3J3
From:       Dick Hendrickson, R. Baker Kearfott
Subject:    Interval Intrinsic Functions
            Operations
References: X3J3/96-065


General guidelines used are:

* Fortran intrinsic functions that accept REAL data should also
  accept INTERVAL data.

* All interval functions shall return enclosures of the range of
  values as real functions. That is, for a function f(x), the returned
  enclosure for f(X), where X = [a,b] is an interval, shall contain
  the set of values:

        {f(x} | a <= x <= b}

  this definition generalizes in a straightforward way to functions
  of n-variables.

* Those generic intrinsics that are REAL elemental functions should also
  operate as elemental functions with INTERVAL vector data.

        Note: The sharpness of the enclosures is not specified, but an
        ideal enclosure should be the smallest-width interval with
        machine numbers as endpoints that contains the actual range.
        Thus, the only accuracy requirement for interval versions of the
        intrinsics mandates that they contain the range of the
        corresponding mathematical function over the set of interval
        arguments.

* Array operations, such as "reshape," work just as they would on
  any other array.

Dick systematically went through F95 intrinsics, categorizing
each intrinsic as follows:

def?    possibly does not apply
dna     does not apply to intervals
easy    straightforward, almost obvious, definition and computation
medium  harder than above to define and compute, but nothing really
           surprising
hard    hard to define and to compute
nc      no change from how F95 applies to structures


Baker, with analysis and other advice from the "interval"
experts (cf. X3J3/95-065), modified  Dick's original
classifications. In such cases, comments appear in the right column.
In particular, continuous monotonic functions are not classified
as "hard," since they can be computed from appropriately rounded
endpoint values; in turn, endpoint values can be obtained from existing
floating point libraries if the accuracy of those libraries is
known. An additional classification of:

tricky  lots of edge and corner cases, otherwise easy

to replace Dick's "hard" has been added.

There is an issue to be resolved concerning what
should be returned if part of the argument is in the domain
of the function and part is not, e.g. SQRT( (<-1,1>) ).  This
can  be disallowed, the range over the meaningful part of the
argument can be returned, or some facility can perhaps be
provided for the user to choose.  Based on the discussion,
my first recommendation is that the user somehow be given
control over which of the above options is executed.  If such user
control is not possible, it is possibly slightly more desirable
to merely return bounds on the range over the meaningful part of
the domain;  this scheme involves less runtime overhead because
of consistency considerations, and possible surprise of the user.
Furthermore, I also recommend that an exception be raised and
NAN be returned if the argument lies entirely outside the domain
of the function.   However,  in some cases, it would be more nearly
correct.  For example the range of SQRT over (<-1,1>) IS defined, but
in the complex plane;  an exception raised here would thus be
analogous to an overflow.

For many of the functions listed below, examples and more
extensive email discussion are available.  There is a fair amount
of  consensus within the interval discussion group,
(cf. X3J3/96-065), but I expect some additional discussion of
several points, as indicated.

                              that they are like those needed for
                              ATAN2.  Nevertheless, it is perfectly

                              -ABS(A).CH.ABS(A).  This is consistent
                              with the definition that the result
                              contain the range.

13.11.3 atan    medium        ATAN is monotonic.
13.11.3 atan2   tricky        There are a number of edge cases to
                              be considered.  But, in principle, it is
                              not difficult.

                              There is a question concerning what to
                              do if the intervals cross a branch
                              point.  For example, if X=(<-1>)
                              and Y=(<-.5,.5>),
                              ATAN2(Y,X) could simply contain
                              the interval [-pi,pi], since
                              the arguments contain the branch
                              point; alternately, may the range
                              be extended to include values greater
                              than pi or less than -pi?  The latter
                              leads to a more precise description
                              of the range and hence to more
                              meaningful computations in many
                              instances.

                              points of this function is well-known,
                              compact, and publicly available free
                              of charge.

13.11.3 tan     medium        The main problem here is
                              representation of infinite values.
                              This could be handled the same
                              as the floating-point version,
                              that is, by returning an error.

                             Implementations should be *permited*
                             to use the IEEE -inf and +inf
                             values to correctly depict the
                             range.  For implementations that do not
                             have these values, there are a number of
                             processor dependent possabilities,
                             including:

                             a) Assign some values, such as the
                                largest and smallest real values
                                to used in place of -inf and +inf.

                             b) Return NaN or abort when intervals
                                cannot be returned that contain
                                the correct result.

                             In no case should a standard conforming
                             interval program be permitted to
                             return an interval result that does not
                             contain the correct answer.
