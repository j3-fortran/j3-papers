where  Y means "yes"

       C       "yes with comment"
       N       "no with comment"

The comments for each interp are attached below in the same order as the
table above.

The summary of DRAFT results is as follows:

    P = passed
    C = passed as amended
    F = further consideration

  F03 F03 F03 F03 F03 F03 F03 F03 F03 F03 F03 F03 F03 F03 F03

    P   P   F   P   P   P   F   F   P   F   P   P   P   F   P

The interps marked "C" pass with some minor typo fixes, as noted
below.

The interps marked "F" will be reconsidered at J3 meeting
#171 by the /interp committee who will decide if the status becomes
"withdraw for more work", "passed as amended", or "passed as
printed".

F03/0001   Generic type-bound procedures

  Rob James' YES comment for F03/0001:

    While there is no technical problem, the different uses of <binding-
    name> are confusing, and should be changed in the next revision of
    the standard.

F03/0012   Procedure pointers and the EXTERNAL attribute

  Michael Ingrassia's NO comment for F03/0012:

    The language is confusing.  Asking reader to follow along that
    "A conspiracy of [thing 1] [thing 2] [thing 3] [thing 4] appears
    to completely wipe out procedure pointers (PPP because of [thing 5]
    )" is insufficiently kind to the reader, and too many different
    points are made.  Split into separate interps please.

F03/0017   Dummy procedure pointers and PRESENT

  Michael Ingrassia's NO comment for F03/0017:

    The statement "It is not clear in 13.7.91 whether the argument of
    PRESENT has or has not the POINTER attribute" seems to me to be
    wrong. In the fragment
        subroutine S(I)
        integer, optional :: I
        if (present(I)) then
    the argument of present does not have the POINTER attribute, but in
    the fragment
        subroutine S(I)
        integer, pointer, optional :: I
        if (present(I)) then
    it does, and the language of 13.7.91 is clear enough "[the argument
    to PRESENT] may be a pointer".  Delete the statement ("It is not
    clear...").  Since that removes justification for the edits
    submitted, change the answer to read "The program does not conform
    to the 2003 standard.  This is because the pointer F is not
    associated in subroutine S, which is not one of the possibilities
    permitted by 12.4.1.3 [271:16]."

F03/0021   What kind of token is a stop code?

  Rob James' NO comment for F03/0021:

    The last edit does not make sense for an <int-literal-constant> that
    does not have a <kind-param>.  [36:37-38] explicitly states that
    such an <int-literal-constant> is of type default integer.  The
    last edit, however, says that the value of this constant does not
    have to be representable in the default integer type.  How can a
    default integer not contain a value representable in the default
    integer type?

  Jeanne Martin's NO comment for F03/0021:

    21, 22, and 24 need more work.  The answers seem incomplete.

F03/0022   Coexistence of IEEE and non-IEEE kinds

  Dick Hendrickson's NO comment on F03/0022:

    The answer doesn't appear to answer the details of the
    question.  Saying that IEEE and non-IEEE reals are both
    allowed is not an answer the question about REQUIRING
    overflow and divide by zero for the NON-IEEE reals in the
    second paragraph.  What practical use is there in requiring
    a processor to support overflow and divide-by-zero for
    NON-IEEE reals in a subroutine that uses both kinds of
    reals?  Surely the purpose of NON-IEEE reals is that they
    are not bound by the same rules as the IEEE reals are.
    Why was it intentional to bind at least some of the IEEE
    rules to them?   The answer should be reversed to state
    that the speculation in the last paragrpah of the question
    is correct, and edits provided.

  Jeanne Martin's NO comment for F03/0022:

    21, 22, and 24 need more work.  The answers seem incomplete.

F03/0024   DEALLOCATE and array pointers

  Dick Hendrickson's NO comment for F03/0024:

    The answer appears to be incomplete.  The question is
    "What exactly does "whole" mean in this rule", but
    the answer appears to be limited just to the specific
    example given.  We also need to consider things like
           b=>a(10:1:-1)
    Also, pining the answer to ASSOCIATED is risky for
    understanding other cases.  ASSOCIATED is true for
    zero sized things.  Given
           ALLOCATE(A(0),C(0))
           b=>C
    then ASSOCIATED(B,A) is true, yet A isn't deallocated.

  Jeanne Martin's NO comment for F03/0024:

    21, 22, and 24 need more work.  The answers seem incomplete.

  Van Snyder's YES comment for F03/0024:

    I'm holding my nose and voting "Yes with comment" on F03/0024.  It's
    OK as far as it goes, and the questions it doesn't answer weren't
    asked.  But I expect there will be another interp along the lines
    of "Is this OK: ALLOCATE(A(N)); B => A(N:1:-1); DEALLOCATE(B)?"  I
    don't really care about the outcome of the vote on that interp, if
    it does come up; I just think the standard should be clear.

F03/0028   Commas in complex namelist output

  Rich Bleikamp's NO vote for F03/0028:

    For historically perverse reasons, a '/' is listed as a value
    separator in list item 2 on page 239 (04-007).  Because of this
    perversity, whereever a 'real' value separator is required, the text
    of F90 and F95 have to specifically call out a comma or period, as
    appropriate.  See 04-007 239:27-29.  A similar sentence is needed
    in section 10.10.1.3 when describing acceptable input forms for the
    complex datatype.

    I would note that fixing the standard so '/' does not need to be
    value separator is a better solution, and was proposed by Walt B in
    the last days of F90 processing, but that is a much harder fix than
    my suggestion above.
