Subject: Performance Information on Open


One recurrent theme, which has never been satisfactorily
answered, is:  "How to put performance hints on OPEN
statements?"  Of course, the reason is that it's very
hard to do so portably.

This paper cribs an idea from the MPI-2 I/O features,
which we may well be able to cobble into something very useful
to Fortran programs.

Title: The INFO= specifier on OPEN Statements

Submitted By: J3

Status: For Consideration

References: OPEN 9.4.5

Basic Functionality: Add a new specifier, INFO= to OPEN
                     to provide performance hints to the rtl.

Rationale:  There are many variables, whose value, if known to the RTL,
            could reasonably be translated into higher performance
            of Fortran I/O.  Items include, large or small buffer,
            large or small physical transfers, single pass of transfers
            or repeated transfers.  The difficulty is to make
            these hints portable.  This is one way to do so.

            See the Cray Unicos man page for "assign" for ideas.

Estimated Impact: This proposal allows vendors to "opt-out"
                  of any hint they want, so there's little impact
                  beyond parsing yet another specifier.

Detailed Specification: New OPEN specifier, INFO=

                        INFO = <info-string>, where the info-string
                        is a list of <info-items>, where each
                        info-item is a KEYWORD=VALUE pair.
                        <info-string> is a <s-d-c-e>.
                        The keyword is a name= string, the value
                        may be a number, logical, or string.

                        The rules are:
                        1. No info-item may change the semantics
                           of the connection.  Each must be
                           a "performance-only" hint.
                        2. No processor is required to recognize
                           any particular info-item.  Any unrecognized
                           info-item must be ignored.
                        3. Processors are encouraged to invent
                           their own info-items, to cover the specifics
                           of their supported systems.
                        4. A short list of keywords is specified, each of
                           which, if a processor chooses to recognize it,
                           has a standard-specified meaning.
                        5. As is our usual way, case is irrelavant
                           to the keywords (the values may depend on case).

                        Suppose keywords BUFFER_SIZE, TRANSFER_SIZE,
                        PREALLOCATE, CONTIGUOUS, ALLOCATE_INCREMENT
                        are given (obvious) meanings (numbers expressed
                        in file storage units?).  Then the following
                        is a standard-conforming OPEN:

                        OPEN( UNIT= iunit, FILE= 'something', &
                           & INFO= 'BUFFER_SIZE=1000000,DEVICE=SCSI-1')

                        If a processor chooses to recognize
                        the BUFFER_SIZE keyword, it will allocate
                        the I/O buffer that large.  The DEVICE
                        keyword is a processor-specific keyword,
                        so no processor (other than the vendor who
                        defined it) need recognize it.  Other
                        processors will ignore it.  (The processor
                        who defined it could ignore it, if it is
                        perhaps momentarily appropriate to do so.)
                        All is subject to the Size and Complexity
                        rule, so obnoxious requests may be ignored.

                        Perhaps INQUIRE should be enhanced to retrieve
                        a connection's info-string, but this paper
                        does not propose to do so.
