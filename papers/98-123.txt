Subject:     Edits for B.2, public entities of private type

Item B.2 on the f2k work list is to allow public entities of private
type.  Interpretations 91 and 161 required quite subtle reading of the
standard to deduce what the restrictions against such entities
actually meant.  It turns out that there is no real reason not to
allow such entities and there are some cases where they can be useful.
It apears to be just a gratuitous restriction that achieves nothing
useful.

Although the need for this feature is not overwhelming, it is probably
easier to allow it than to write reasonably clear text disallowing it.
The text in f90/f95 does not meet the criterion of being reasonably
clear.  This is witnessed by the subtle reasoning in interpretation
161, the several compilers that interpreted it differently, and the
continuing questions on this subject from users.

The only question of any significance is whether the components of a
public object of private type can be visible.  These edits go for
consistency with the other rules for the meaning of PRIVATE; that the
private attribute hides only a name, not the inderlying object.  Thus,
if a type is private, you cannot use that type name outside of the
module, but this does not prevent you from doing anything that does
not explicitly use the type name.  This is the same rule adopted for
host association, where "hiding" a type name does not per se hide any
variables of the type or ability to access their components.

The main reason for this choice is its simplicity.  There is then
nothing special about a type name being private.  Any other choice
still leaves a vestige of interp 161 to answer.

[39:5-7] Delete this constraint.  (1st constraint after R427)

[40:44-45] "the type name...are accessible" ->
   "the type name, and thus the structure constructor(4.4.4)
    of the type, is accessible"

[40:50+]  Add shaded note
  BEGIN NOTE
    The accessibility of a type name is independent of the
    accessibility of the components of the type.  It is possible to
    have all four combinations: public name with public components,
    private name with private components, public name with private
    components, and private name with public components.
  END NOTE

[50:16] Delete this constraint.  (10th constraint after R506)

[62:7-9] Delete this constraint.  (3rd constraint after R523)
