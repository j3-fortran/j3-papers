Part 2: Correctly numbered F95 interpretations

NUMBER: 00000e
TITLE: Rejected Minor edits and corrections
KEYWORDS: typographical errors
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress - done

QUESTION: Should the following be added to the list of edits?

 8. In 13.13.85 RANGE

        change 'Returns the decimal exponent range in the model ...'
            to 'Returns the upper bound of the decimal exponent range
                of the model ...' [228:20]

    Rationale(1): a range has two values; RANGE returns only one.

    Rationale(2): there is not a decimal range in the model, see
                  13.7.1, but a decimal range can be calculated. Thus
                  the change from 'in' to 'of'.

 9. In 13.13.79 PRECISION

        change 'Returns the decimal precision in the model ...'
            to '............................. of .............' at
            [226:4]

    Rationale: same as for RANGE, above.

ANSWER:

This item collects failed "minor edits and corrections" so that the
reasons for failing them can be recorded for historical purposes. No
further voting is needed for items in this list.

No, 8 and 9 should not be added.  The use of 'range' is consistent
with other uses in the standard and is meant to convey an entire
range of values not just 2.  The change from 'in' to 'of' is too
small a change to be included at this time and would best be
addressed in a future standard.

NUMBER: 000004
TITLE: Value returned by MAXVAL/MINVAL
KEYWORDS: MAXVAL, MINVAL
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot - done

QUESTION:

The Result Value section of the MAXVAL intrinsic function description
uses the phrasing:

  or has the value of the negative number of the largest magnitude
  supported by the processor for numbers of the type and kind type
  parameter of ARRAY if ARRAY has size zero

This phrasing has generated at least the two following views on the
return value:

 * If the machine supports the IEEE standard then the implementation
   should return -inf.
 * For portability, the implementation should return -HUGE(ARRAY).

These views lead to the following questions:

1. Is the intent of the standard to describe the result in terms of
   machine values rather than model values?

2. If the answer to 1 is "yes", how are programmers expected to use
   this intrinsic function portably?

ANSWER:

1.   Yes.  Processors may support values that are not present in the
model of 13.7.1.  IEEE -inf is an example of such a number and this
may be returned on a machine that supports the IEEE standard.  If the
negative number of the largest magnitude in the model had been
intended, the model would have been mentioned as, for example, in the
definition of HUGE (13.14.39).

2.   A simple example of its use is to test whether a set of numbers
SET1 has a value greater than any value in the set SET2.  Consider
the expression MAXVAL (SET1) > MAXVAL (SET2).  If SET1 is empty and
SET2 is not, this value is correctly false even if all of the values
are outside the model with values less than -HUGE (SET1).

     All of the reduction functions (e.g., MAXVAL, SUM) return values
when the arguments are zero-sized arrays that may be the same as the
values returned for some non-zero-sized arguments.

NOTE:

The NO votes in 00-254 were concerned that IEEE Infinities are not
model numbers and are therefore not valid results for MINVAL and
MAXVAL.  The IEEE 754 standard is neither integrated into nor
required by Fortran 95. However concessions were made to allow some
IEEE exceptional values to be used by standard-conforming processors,
like limited support for -0.0.

NUMBER: 000006
TITLE: Character length specification of a function result
KEYWORDS: character, function result
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot - done

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

      PROGRAM main
      CHARACTER(8) arg, func
      EXTERNAL func
      CALL sub(arg, func)
      END PROGRAM

      SUBROUTINE sub(arg, func)
      CHARACTER(*) arg, func
      CHARACTER(8) str
      str = func(arg)
      ...
      END SUBROUTINE

      CHARACTER(8) FUNCTION func(arg)
      CHARACTER(*) arg
      ...
      END FUNCTION

Some implementations reject the reference to FUNC in subroutine SUB
and some do not.  The implementations that do not reject the reference
to FUNC use essentially the following as the argument for allowing
the reference:

  The rules for when an asterisk can be used to specify character
  length are specified in section 5.1.1.5 (middle of page 51 of
  the Fortran 95 standard).

    * The first rule states that an asterisk may be used to declare a
      dummy argument of a procedure.  It is clear that FUNC is a
      dummy argument of SUB.

    * The third rule says that in an external function, the length of
      the result may be specified within the function itself with an
      asterisk but if the result length is so specified, any invoker
      of the function must specify the character length of the
      function result as something other than an asterisk.  But the
      function that is being invoked in the above example does not
      declare its result length using the asterisk, so this rule does
      not apply.

Is the above sample program a standard conforming program with
respect to the concept of declaring the function result length in the
invoking program as an asterisk?

ANSWER:

Yes. When item (1) on page 51 is applied to the argument func of sub,
it tells us that its length is 8 for the call from the main program.

NOTE:

The NO votes in 01-380 raised the concern that this answer introduced
a binary incompatibility with FORTRAN 77.  FORTRAN 77 features
continue to work in Fortran 95;  Fortran 95 features may not always
work in FORTRAN 77.

TITLE: Optional arguments to MAX/MIN
KEYWORDS: intrinsic function, MAX, MIN, optional, argument
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot - done

QUESTION:

It appears that there is a missing "optional" in the description of
the optional arguments [, A3, ...] in the MAX and MIN functions.  In
the Fortran 90 standard, the MAX/MIN descriptions said "optional
arguments.  A3, ...", but those words do not appear 13.14.64 of the
Fortran 95 standard.

Section 13.3 of Fortran 95 [217:27+] states

  ...optional arguments... are identified by the notation "optional"
  in the argument descriptions.

and goes on to describe another notation for the arguments that are
listed as optional.  But it doesn't say anything about arguments
given in [...] and NOT also listed as optional.

Suggested change to the argument descriptions for MAX and MIN:

Arguments.
A1, A2     shall both have the same type which shall be integer or
           real and they shall both have the same kind type parameter.

A3, ... (optional)  shall have the same type and kind type parameter
           as A1.

ANSWER:

There is an anomaly in the presentation of MAX and MIN but the intent
is clear, ie, dummy arguments A3 and beyond are optional.

EDITS: None

NOTE:

The same descriptive form reported here in Fortran 95 appears in
Fortran 2003 for MAX and MIN.

TITLE: Characteristics of an array function result
KEYWORDS: Characteristics, function
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot - done

Sections 12.2.1.1 and 12.2.2 of the Fortran 95 standard define rules
for dummy arguments and function returns in the presence of explicit
interfaces that allow array bounds expressions to be evaluated on
either the calling side or the called side of a call.  The
interpretation provided for RFI 000049 on the X3J3 website clarifies
and reinforces the conditions that permit evaluation on either side
of the call.  The erratum published in the same file for RFI 000070
changes the semantics of dummy arguments.  The erratum does not
explicitly mention function results, but it might be considered to
imply a similar change to the semantics of function results.

The erratum provided for RFI 000070 refers to altered text for the
interpretation provided for RFI 000049.  The version of the
interpretation that appears in the file on the X3J3 website does not
contain the altered text.

The definition of characteristics of function results as stated in
Section 12.2.2 of the Fortran 95 standard permits more efficient
implementation of array-valued functions, at least for some
architectures, than the definition implied by the erratum provided
for RFI 000070.  For Sun, it is more efficient for the calling
routines to allocate space for array results than to have the called
routines allocate the space.  In order for the calling routine to
allocate space for an array result, it must know the size of the
array.  To determine the size of the array, it must evaluate the
array bounds expressions given in the explicit interface for the
function.

Section 12.2.2 of the Fortran 95 standard requires the values of the
nonconstant bounds expressions given in an explicit interface to be
the same as the values of the bounds expressions given in the
corresponding function definition.  Thus, the values of the
nonconstant bounds expressions used to determine the size of the
array result can be passed to the called routine, avoiding any need
for the called routine to re-evaluate those expressions. Because
Fortran 95 allows user-defined routines to appear in bounds
expressions, evaluating the bounds expressions more than once per
call could prove inefficient and confusing.

The change implied by the erratum provided for RFI 000070 would
remove the nonconstant bounds expressions from the characteristics of
function results. The shape would still be a characteristic, but the
same shape can be produced by many different values of the bounds
expressions.  Thus, the values of the nonconstant bounds expressions
used in the called routine may differ from the values of the
corresponding expressions in the explicit interface.

For example, consider the explicit interface

      INTERFACE
        FUNCTION FOO(F, G, H)
          INTERFACE
            PURE INTEGER FUNCTION F()
            END FUNCTION
            PURE INTEGER FUNCTION G()
            END FUNCTION
            PURE INTEGER FUNCTION H()
            END FUNCTION
          END INTERFACE
          CHARACTER*(F()) FOO(G():H())
        END FUNCTION
      END INTERFACE

The definition given in Section 12.2.2 of the Fortran 95 standard
requires the values of the length and bounds expressions in the
interface to be the same as the values of the corresponding length
and bounds expressions in the function definition.

Under the definition implied by the erratum provided for RFI 000070,
the shapes must match, but the values of the nonconstant bounds
expressions need not. Thus, the function definition might be

      FUNCTION FOO(F, G, H)
        INTERFACE
          PURE INTEGER FUNCTION F()
          END FUNCTION
          PURE INTEGER FUNCTION G()
          END FUNCTION
          PURE INTEGER FUNCTION H()
          END FUNCTION
        END INTERFACE
        CHARACTER*(F()) FOO(G()-1:H()-1)
        . . .
      END FUNCTION

In this case, the values of the bounds expressions used in the called
routine must be the values of the expressions specified in the
function definition, not the values of the expressions specified in
the interface block.

QUESTION:

If a bound of a function result array is not a constant expression,
is the exact dependence on the entities in the expression a
characteristic of the function result?

ANSWER:

No. According to Corrigendum 1, the correct statement is now:

"If a bound of a function result array is not an initialization
expression, the exact dependence on the entities in the expression is
a characteristic of the function result."

NUMBER: 000023
TITLE: Termination of the previous record by a WRITE statement
KEYWORDS: Nonadvancing, Record termination, WRITE
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot - done

QUESTION:

Suppose a sequential formatted file is positioned within a record as
a result of a nonadvancing READ.

1. If the next operation performed on the file is a WRITE, can the
   current record be terminated at its current position before the
   next record is written?  Section 9.2.1.3.2 appears to preclude the
   record from being terminated, but at least one Fortran 90
   implementation does the record in such an instance.

2. If next operation is a nonadvancing WRITE and the number of
   characters written does not extend to the end of the current
   record, are the remaining characters at the end of the record
   preserved?

ANSWER:

1. No.  If the current record were to be terminated, the file
   position would be changed.  Section 9.2.1.3.2 of Fortran 95
   [136:37-39] states:
   "For sequential access on input, if there is a current record, the
   file position is not changed.  Otherwise, the file is positioned
   at the beginning of the next record and this record becomes the
   current record."

2. Yes.  The remaining characters in the record are preserved.

   Consider the following different, but related, example:

        program write_write
        write (10,"(a,t1,a,a)") "XXXXXXXXX", "ABC", "DEF"
        write (10,"(a,t1,a)",advance='no') "XXXXXXXXX", "ABC"
        write (10,"(a)") "DEF"
        end

   The output from this program is

        ABCDEFXXX
        ABCDEFXXX

   From the description of Position editing (10.6.1) it is clear
   that the output following the tab does not cause the deletion
   of the final XXX characters from the record.  The fact that the
   second output record is created by a non-advancing write
   followed by an advancing write is not operationally different
   from the single advancing write that created the first record.

   The fundamental difference between this example and the question
   considered in the interp is the mechanism by which the current
   location in the record is established prior to the final
   advancing write statement. It would be inconsistent to have one
   case preserve previously existing characters in the record and
   the other case to require the opposite.  To avoid this
   inconsistency, the answer to Question 2 is Yes.

TITLE: Ordering requirements on definition of specification functions
KEYWORDS: Specification expressions, specification functions
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: F95: Passed by WG5 ballot;  Included in F03 corrigendum 1

QUESTION:

Consider the following program unit.

      MODULE MOD
        INTERFACE INT
          MODULE PROCEDURE F1, F2
        END INTERFACE
      CONTAINS
        INTEGER PURE FUNCTION F1(I)
          INTEGER :: A(INT(1_4)), B(INT(1_2))    ! A(1), B(19)
          INTEGER, PARAMETER :: KIND = SIZE(A)   ! KIND == 1
          INTEGER(KIND), INTENT(IN) :: I

          F1 = 17
        END FUNCTION F1

        INTEGER PURE FUNCTION F2(J)
          INTEGER :: C(INT(2_4))                 ! C(2)
          INTEGER, PARAMETER :: KIND = SIZE(C)   ! KIND == 2
          INTEGER(KIND), INTENT(IN) :: J

          F2 = 19
        END FUNCTION F2
      END MODULE MOD

In processing the references to "INT(1_4)" and "INT(1_2)" in F1, the
processor needs to determine whether the references are to the
intrinsic function, INT, or to one of the specific procedures, F1 or
F2.  Determining that requires the processor to have determined the
kind type parameter of the dummy argument J, of F2.  In turn, that
requires the processor to determine whether the reference to
"INT(2_4)" is a reference to the intrinsic function, INT, or to one
of the specific procedures, F1 or F2.  Determining that requires the
processor to determine the kind type parameter of the dummy argument
I, which requires it to determine that "INT(1_4)" in F1 was a
reference to the intrinsic function INT.

After all this is determined, the processor can determine that the
reference to "INT(1_2)" in the declaration of B in F1 is a reference
to the specification function F2.

According to 7.1.6.1 [94:38-41],

     "If an initialization expression includes a reference to an
      inquiry function for a type parameter or an array bound of an
      object specified in the same <specification-part>, the type
      parameter or array bound shall be specified in a prior
      specification of the <specification-part>.  The prior
      specification may be to the left of the inquiry function in the
      same statement."

According to 7.1.6.2 [96:27-37],

     "A variable in a specification expression shall have its type and
      type parameters, if any, specified by a previous declaration in
      the same scoping unit, or by the implicit typing rules in effect
      for the scoping unit, or by host or use association.  If a
      variable in a specification expression is typed by the implicit
      typing rules, its appearance in any subsequent type declaration
      statement shall confirm the implied type and type parameters.

      If a specification expression includes a reference to an inquiry
      function for a type parameter or an array bound of an entity
      specified in the same <specification-part>, the type parameter
      or array bound shall be specified in a prior specification of
      the <specification-part>.  The prior specification may be to
      the left of the inquiry function reference in the same
      statement.  If a specification expression includes a reference
      to the value of an element of an array specified in the same
      <specification-part>, the array shall be completely specified
      in prior declarations."

The rules regarding references to variables in a specification
expressions and initialization expressions require a strict
left-to-right, top-to-bottom ordering between specification and
inquiry.  Specification functions appear to be unrestricted in this
respect.

Assuming that the processor supports integers with kind type
parameters of 1, 2 and 4, was it the intent of the committee that the
program unit above should be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

No, it is not the intent that the above program unit be standard
conforming.  The required complexity of implementation is not
justified.  The standard has no prohibition against it, but the
lack of such a prohibition was an oversight.  The edits below
correct this oversight.

EDITS:

Add the following new paragraph immediately before Note 7.14:

  If an initialization expression in a module includes a reference to
  a generic, that generic shall have no specific procedures defined
  in the module subsequent to the initialization expression.

Add the following new paragraph immediately before Note 7.16:

  If a specification expression in a module includes a reference to
  a generic, that generic shall have no specific procedures defined
  in the module subsequent to the specification expression.

TITLE: Asterisks as I/O units
KEYWORDS: Asterisk, I/O, unit
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot - done

Question:

1.   Does the Fortran 95 standard require the external unit
     corresponding to the I/O unit identified by an asterisk for
     input or output to be the same as the external unit identified
     by some fixed nonnegative integer value?

2.   Can the I/O unit identified by an asterisk for input or output
     correspond to more than one external unit?

3.   If the external unit identified by an integer value that
     corresponds to the I/O unit identified by an asterisk for input
     or output is closed, does that cause the I/O unit identified by
     an asterisk to become disconnected?

ANSWER:

     1.   No.

     2.   No.

     3.   Not addressed by Fortran 95.

DISCUSSION:

The submitter states:  At least one Fortran 95 implementation uses -1
as the value of the I/O unit identified by an asterisk.  A carefully
constructed INQUIRE statement can expose this value to the user.  Many
users expect I/O to the units identified by asterisks to continue to
work even after the corresponding units identified by integer values
have been closed.

     1.   There is no requirement in the standard that the asterisk
correspond to an external-file-unit; it is, however, permissible.

     2.   For the units identified by the asterisk, the text of
section 9.3.2 does not allow two or more units to be connected
simultaneously to the same file [139:8-9].

     3.   Fortran 95 does not specify the behavior in this instance.

TITLE: Resolving generic procedure references
KEYWORDS: INTENT(IN), NULLIFY
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: F95: Passed by WG5 ballot:  Included in F03 corrigendum 1

QUESTION:

14.1.2.4 (Resolving procedure references) seems to fail to resolve
the following example.

Consider:
  INTERFACE sin
    CHARACTER FUNCTION sinch(c)
      CHARACTER,INTENT(IN) :: c
    END
  END INTERFACE
  PRINT *,sin(3.5)  ! Reference to which procedure?
END

According to rule (1)(a), SIN is established to be generic; thus
references are resolved by the rules in 14.1.2.4.1.

In 14.1.2.4.1:
   Rule (1) fails - the reference is not consistent with any
            specific interface in the interface block for SIN.
   Rule (2) fails for the same reason.
   Rule (3) fails because there is no INTRINSIC statement.
   Rule (4) fails because there is no host scoping unit.

Is this program legal?
How should the reference to the generic procedure be resolved?

ANSWER:

This program was intended to be valid.
The reference is to the intrinsic SIN.
An edit is supplied to clarify this.

DISCUSSION:

(1) INTERFACE OPERATOR(+) does not hide the intrinsic operator.
(2) CHARACTER SIN does not hide the intrinsic function.

Given that, it would seem perverse for
    INTERFACE SIN
to completely block the intrinsic.  Indeed, according to interp
F90/000054 the intrinsic is still accessible in this kind of
situation.

Furthermore, it is clear from the original version of Fortran 90 that
a user generic was not intended to hide the intrinsic.  This text was
modified by interpretation F90/000083 which allowed the user to
override an intrinsic function by providing a specific function with
the same argument characteristics.  The failure of the current
14.1.2.4.1 to resolve the above example was an inadvertent side-effect
of that change.

EDITS:

[279:36+] Append new paragraph
  "If (1), (2), (3) and (4) do not apply, the name is that of an
intrinsic procedure, and the reference is consistent with the
interface of that intrinsic procedure, then the reference is to that
intrinsic procedure."

{Note:  This edit made to Fortran 2003 in WG5/N1620 is made as item
        (5), not as a new paragraph.  In 05-182r1, a "," follows

TITLE: End-of-record and PAD
KEYWORDS: End-of-record, PAD
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: F95: Passed by WG5 ballot;  Included in F03 corrigendum 1

Subclause 9.4.3 specifies:

  If an end-of-record condition occurs during execution of a
  nonadvancing input statement, the following occurs: if the PAD=
  specifier has the value YES, the record is padded with blanks
  (9.4.4.4.2) to satisfy the input list item and corresponding data
  edit descriptor that require more characters than the record
  contains;

There appears to be a problem if a list item does not correspond to
exactly one edit descriptor.

QUESTION:

If an End-of-record condition occurs during execution of a
nonadvancing input statement and the PAD= specifier has the value YES

  (1) do enough blanks get supplied for the next data edit descriptor
      and whatever part of the list item corresponds to that edit
      descriptor, or
  (2) do enough blanks get supplied for the remainder of the list item
      and as many edit descriptors as necessary, or
  (3) do enough blanks get supplied to process the rest of the input
      list?

ANSWER:

The situation can only arise for list items of complex type, because
list items of derived type are processed as if their components had
appeared as list items -- see [149:8-10].  It is clear from text at
[150:15] and [153:13] that blanks are not supplied for more than one
list item.  So the answer to part (3) of the question is "no".  Since
the texts at [150:15] and [153:13] also refer to a single format item,
this leaves the answer to parts (1) and (2) of the question ambiguous:
Is it one list item, or one edit descriptor?

The answer is that enough blanks are supplied by the processor to
satisfy all of the edit descriptors for a list item.

TITLE: STAT= variable requirements in ALLOCATE
KEYWORDS: ALLOCATE, STAT=
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot - done

QUESTION:

[79:40-41] says
  "The <stat-variable> shall not appear in a bound in the same
   ALLOCATE statement."

This requirement appears, on the face of it, to apply to the syntax,
not to whichever actual variable is identified by the syntax.

Question 1:

Given
  INTEGER :: A(10) = (/ (i,i=1,10) /)
  POINTER P(:)
  READ *,I,J
  ALLOCATE(P(A(I)),STAT=A(J))

Is the ALLOCATE standard-conforming, or does it depend on the relative
values of I and J?

From the quoted text, it would appear that it is always conforming,
even when I==J.

Question 2:

Similarly, given:
  EQUIVALENCE(I,J)
  POINTER P(:)
  I = 5
  ALLOCATE(P(I),STAT=J)

is the ALLOCATE conforming?

Question 3:

Similarly, given:
  POINTER P(:)
  INTRINSIC DIGITS
  I = 5
  ALLOCATE(P(DIGITS(I)),STAT=I)

is the ALLOCATE conforming?

From the quoted text, it would appear not to be conforming, despite
the non-dependence of the array bound on the value of the STAT=
variable.

ANSWER:

The intent was that the restriction should apply to the actual
variable being used for the STAT= variable, not to the syntax.  Thus,

(1) The ALLOCATE statement is only standard-conforming if I and J are
    not equal.

(2) The ALLOCATE statement is not standard-conforming.

(3) The ALLOCATE statement is standard-conforming.

Edits to the standard are supplied to clarify this.

EDITS:

[79:40-41] Delete "The ... statement."
[80:6] Append to paragraph
  "No array bound in an ALLOCATE statement shall depend on the value

TITLE: TARGET attribute and structure components
KEYWORDS: TARGET, POINTER
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot - done

QUESTION:

The standard says ([110:43-44]), of R737 <pointer-assignment-stmt>,
  "Constraint: The <variable> shall have the TARGET attribute or be a
               subobject of an object with the TARGET attribute, or
               it shall have the POINTER attribute."

It also says ([75:22-23]), of structure components
  "A structure component has the ... TARGET ... attribute if the
   parent object has the attribute."

The <<parent object>> is defined ([75:16]) as
   "the data object whose name is the leftmost part name".

Consider:
  TYPE t
    REAL x
  END TYPE
  TYPE(t),POINTER :: p
  REAL,POINTER :: q
  ALLOCATE(p)
  q => p%x

Q1. Is this standard-conforming?

If the answer to Q1 is Yes, this still appears to leave unspecified
the case of A%B%C where A does not have the TARGET attribute and B
has the POINTER attribute.  The parent object of A%B%C is just A, and
A does not have the TARGET attribute.

Therefore the conclusion is that A%B%C does not have the TARGET
attribute.

Note: Although the standard says that "Allocation of a pointer
creates an object that implicitly has the TARGET attribute"
[81:47-48], is it not entirely sure that this shows that A%B%C has
the attribute for two reasons:

(1) Allocation is not the only way of establishing pointer
    associations.
(2) According to the quoted text, whether A%B refers to an object
    with the TARGET attribute is immaterial; the only question is
    whether A itself has the TARGET attribute.

Q2. Does this A%B%C have the TARGET attribute?

Note: the following example may be relevant:

  TYPE t
    TYPE(t2),POINTER :: p
  END TYPE
  TYPE t2
    REAL x
  END TYPE
  TYPE(t) v
  TYPE(t2),POINTER :: z
  REAL,POINTER :: q
  ALLOCATE(v%p)
  !
  ! (a)
  !
  z => v%p
  q => z%x
  !
  ! (b)
  !
  q => v%p%x

The pointer assignments following (a) are clearly valid: the first
assigns one pointer to another, and if the answer to Q1 is Yes, the
second one follows from that.

But the (a) statements have the same effect as the (b) statement, so
it would be inconsistent to disallow (b).

Q3. Apparently, substrings never have the INTENT, TARGET or PARAMETER
    attribute.  Is this a deliberate omission?

ANSWER:

Q1: Yes.  P points to an object with the TARGET attribute, and X is a
    subobject of this object.  Therefore, "Q => P%X" is conforming.

Q2: The standard leaves this case unspecified, but the intent is that
    any part of an object with the TARGET attribute should itself
    have the attribute.  An edit is supplied to remedy this omission
    in the standard.

Q3: No, this omission was inadvertant.  An edit is supplied to fix
    this.

EDITS:

[74:33] Append to paragraph
  "A substring has the INTENT, TARGET, or PARAMETER attribute if its
   parent has the attribute, but it never has the POINTER attribute."
{Fix omission.  Text parallels that for array elements and sections.}

[75:22] Delete ", TARGET,".

[75:23] After "." insert
  "A structure component has the TARGET attribute if the parent
   object has the attribute or if any <part-ref> except the rightmost
   has the POINTER attribute."

[110:43-44] Delete
  "be a subobject of an object with the TARGET attribute or it shall
   have".
{Now that propagation of TARGET is fixed, we don't need the weasel
 words.}

TITLE:  Representation method of result of REAL
KEYWORDS: "Representation method" KIND REAL
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot - done

QUESTIONS:

Subclause numbers refer to 97-007r2.

The second and third sentences of subclause 4.3.1.2 are

     A processor shall provide two or more approximation methods that
     define sets of values for data of type real. Each such method has
     a representation method and is characterized by a value for a
     type parameter called the kind type parameter.

1. Does this imply that there is a one-to-one correspondence between
kind type parameter values and representation methods?

Since the second quoted sentence says "a value," not "some values,"
assume the answer to this question is "yes."

Subclause 7.1.4.2 specifies the type and kind type paramter value for
the result of an operation.

2. Is a processor allowed to use a representation method that
corresponds to a different kind type parameter value of the same type,
or no kind type parameter value, at least if neither the precision nor
exponent range of the different representation method is less than the
one specified in 7.1.4.2?

Subclause 7.1.4.1 specifies the type and kind type paramter value for
a variable.

3. Is a processor allowed to use a representation method that
corresponds to a different kind type parameter value of the same type,
or no kind type parameter value, at least if neither the precision nor
exponent range of the different representation method is less than the
one specified in 7.1.4.1?

Subclause 7.1.4.1 specifies the type and kind type parameter value
for a result of a function.

4. Is a processor allowed to use a representation method that
corresponds to a different kind type parameter value of the same type,
or no kind type parameter value, at least if neither the precision nor
exponent range of the different representation method is less than the
one specified in 7.1.4.1?

Subclause 13.14.28 specifies that the result of DBLE is the same as
the result of REAL with a KIND argument having the value KIND(0.0d0).

Subclause 13.14.88 specifies that the kind type parameter value of the
result of REAL is that specified by the KIND argument.

5. Is a processor allowed to use a representation method for the
result that corresponds to a different kind type parameter value of
the same type, or no kind type parameter value, at least if neither
the precision nor exponent range of the different representation
method is less than the one specified in 13.14.88?

ANSWER:

The answer to question 1 is yes, since each valid real kind type
parameter value characterizes a representation method for an
approximation method (4.3.1.2).

Clause 1.4 says
   'This standard does not specify ...
   (6) The physical properties of the representation of quantities and
   the method of rounding, approximating, or computing numeric values
   on a particular processor,
   ...'

The processor is therefore free to use different precision for
intermediate real calculations, which answers all the other questions.

Question 4: What is the meaning of the phrase "the exact dependence
on the entities" in section 12.2.2?

ANSWER:

Answer 1. Yes
Answer 2. Yes
Answer 3. Yes
Answer 4.  The sentence containing the phrase "the exact dependence
on the entities" in section 12.2.2 is intended to convey that in
those cases where the shape or character length type parameter is not
constant, the corresponding characteristic of the function result is
not a value but the way the value is determined when the procedure is
invoked.

Discussion: Only the mapping from program state to value is
significant, not the particular form in which that mapping is
expressed.

In question 3, for example, it is a characteristic of FUN and ENT
that their lengths are twice the value of M.  It is not required that
the expressions of this mapping be identical, only that they yield
the same results.  Thus, twice the value of M could be expressed as
M+M for FUN and as M*2 for ENT.

The phrase "the exact dependence on the entities in the expression is
a characteristic" is used to give the processor the freedom to
evaluate lengths and bounds in any convenient manner.  Since the
characteristics must be the same, the phrase implies, as a minimum,
that the expressions be algebraically equivalent and use the same
variables.  In an example such as:

            FUNCTION FUN(M)
            CHARACTER (LEN=M)::FUN
            CHARACTER (LEN=M + 0*K)::ENT
            ...
            ENTRY ENT(M, K)
            ...
            END

FUN and ENT do not have the same characteristics since their
dependence on "K" is different.  Indeed, if on entry to FUN the
length of FUN or ENT were evaluated using the expression for the
length of ENT the evaluation would fail since K is not associated
with a value.

Clearly, it can be extremely difficult to determine on a static basis
whether two expressions of a mapping are consistent, and there is no
requirement in the standard that this be done.  It would be possible
to check during execution that the values expressed are identical
each time such a procedure is invoked, but it is expected that a more
typical application of this requirement would be to assume that it
has been met and use one expression of this mapping as the basis for
computing attributes of all of the result variables.

QUESTION:

Section 12.3.2.2 indicates that an interface body specifies all of a
procedure's characteristics and that the characteristics must be
consistent with those in the procedure definition.  Are the following
code fragments standard conforming?

(a)      PROGRAM FRED
           INTERFACE
             SUBROUTINE SUB (ARR,J)
               INTEGER ARR(1:)
             END SUBROUTINE
           END INTERFACE
         INTEGER ARR(10)
         CALL SUB(ARR,2)
         END PROGRAM

         SUBROUTINE SUB(ARR, J)
           INTEGER ARR(J:)
           ...
         END SUBROUTINE SUB

(b)      FUNCTION C1( )
           CHARACTER(*) C1
           ...
         END FUNCTION C1
         FUNCTION C2(N)
           CHARACTER(N) C2
           ...
         END FUNCTION C2

         SUBROUTINE CALLER( )
           INTERFACE
             FUNCTION C1( )
               CHARACTER(*) C1
             END FUNCTION
             FUNCTION C2(N)
               CHARACTER(2) C2
             END FUNCTION
           END INTERFACE
           CHARACTER(5) CC
           CC=C1( )//C2(2)

ANSWER:

  (a)  This example is standard conforming.

  (b)  This example is not standard conforming.

Discussion:

(a) 12.2.1.1 states that the characteristics of a dummy data object
include its shape, and that if the shape is assumed then that is a
characteristic.  Section 2.4.5 states that the shape of an array is
determined by its rank and extent in each dimension (but not by its
bounds, 5.1.2.4.2).  Both the interface block for SUB and the
definition of SUB describe the shape of ARR as assumed, so they are
describing the same shape, and the program is standard conforming.

(b) Section 12.2.2 states that the characteristics of a function
include whether or not the function result value is a character of
assumed length.  So the interface body for function C1 must indicate
that C1 is of assumed length. However, item (3) in 5.1.1.5 indicates
that scoping units that invoke an external character function of
assumed length must have access to a declaration of the function name
with a length type parameter value other than *. This is explained in
Note 5.6, (which has been removed in Fortran 2003).

In addition, the interface for C2 does not conform to the standard as
the length of C2 specified as 2 is not consistent with the length
specified as N within the function definition.

DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot - done

QUESTION:  "Declaration" is a significant concept of Fortran 90.

Section 5 is titled "Data object declarations and specifications" and
what were in FORTRAN 77 "type statements" are now "type declaration
statements".  5.1.1 states

    "A type specifier specifies the type of all entities declared in
     an entity declaration list."

Nowhere, though, is there a definition of "declaration".

What does it mean, in Fortran 90, to "declare" something?

ANSWER:

That is correct, the standard does not define the term "declaration".
It is used both in the sense of explicit specification, and of
implicit declaration via usage or context.  Both of these meanings
fall within the normal English meaning of the term.

The suggestion that the standard should define the term "declaration"
may be considered for a future revision of the standard.

KEYWORDS: POINTER attribute, TARGET attribute, structure, structure
          component
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot - done

QUESTION:

Section 6.1.2 (page 63) states:

   "A structure component has the INTENT, TARGET, or PARAMETER
    attribute if the parent object has the attribute."

A constraint following R505 (page 40) states:

   "Constraint: If the POINTER attribute is specified, the TARGET,
    INTENT, EXTERNAL, or INTRINSIC attribute must not be specified."

This would seem to imply that a derived-type object with a pointer
component could not have the TARGET attribute. Though it is
informative, Annex C.4.6 (page 267) contains the following example:

       "TYPE CELL
                INTEGER :: VAL
                TYPE (CELL), POINTER :: NEXT_CELL
        END TYPE CELL
        TYPE (CELL), TARGET :: HEAD
        TYPE (CELL), POINTER :: CURRENT
        ...
        CURRENT => HEAD"

which allows the static head of a linked list or tree.  Does the
structure component HEAD % NEXT_CELL contradict the text cited above
from section 6.1.2 or the cited constraint following R505?

ANSWER:

No, the component reference does not contradict either the constraint
or the cited text from 6.1.2.  The cited text from 6.1.2 has been
clarified by F95 interpretation 000100.

Discussion: The constraints that follow a syntax rule, or a set of
syntax rules, are syntactic constraints and apply only to the syntax
rules they immediately follow.  Thus, the constraints that follow
rules R501 through R505 at the beginning of section 5 apply only to
those rules.  This means they apply only to type declaration
statements.  Since a derived type component is part of a derived type
definition (which is not a type declaration statement), the
constraints do not apply to derived type components.  The rule that
prevents an entity from having conflicting attributes when applied by
multiple specification statements is found in 5.2:

  "The combination of attributes that may be specified for a
   particular entity is subject to the same restrictions as for type
   declaration statements regardless of the method of specification."

              CALL GEN2()      ! CALL TO G3
         END SUBROUTINE

      END

There are rules in section 14.1.2.3 that determine within a scoping
unit what procedures can have the same generic specification.  These
rules directly mention access of a generic procedure via use
association, but they make no mention of generic names accessed via
host association.

There is evidence that the rules in section 14.1.2.3 were not intended
to apply to generic interfaces accessed by host association.  Section
14.1.2.4.1 indicates that a call to a generic name can be resolved to
a generic name in the host if the scoping unit and the host scoping
unit both agree that the generic name is the name of a function or a
subroutine.  This indicates that in the example above, the definition
of 'GEN2' is valid, even though 'G1' and 'G2' are functions while 'G3'
is a subroutine.  If the rules set out in 14.1.2.3 were to apply then
the definition of 'GEN2' would be invalid.

Do the rules in 14.1.2.3 apply to generic procedures accessed via host
association?

ANSWER:

Yes. [277:12-14] in Fortran 95 explains that the rules apply for all
accessible generic interfaces, including those accessible by host
association.  The example program is not valid.

TITLE: Collating sequence inconsistencies
KEYWORDS: Collating sequence, ACHAR, CHAR, ICHAR
DEFECT TYPE: interpretation
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot - done

[F95 36:28+] says that "A <<collating sequence>> is a one-to-one
mapping of the characters into the nonnegative integers such that
each character corresponds to a different nonnegative integer."

QUESTION 1:

Does this definition imply that the one-to-one mapping is
dense? That is, is there a requirement that if the default CHARACTER
type has <n> characters, the corresponding collating sequence maps
to 0..<n>-1 ?

QUESTION 2:

If the answer to question 1 is NO: is it correct that the restriction
  0 <= i <= <n>-1
on argument I of the intrinsic procedure CHAR (13.14.19) is
inappropriate?

QUESTION 3:

If the answer to question 1 is NO: is it correct that the
description of the << Result Value>> of the intrinsic procedure ICHAR
(13.14.45), 0 <= ICHAR(C) <= <n>-1 is inappropriate?

QUESTION 4:

Shouldn't argument I of the intrinsic procedure ACHAR
(13.14.2) be restricted to the nonnegative integers?

ANSWERS:

(1) Yes. In the context of Fortran the character collating sequence is
    an ordered list of the characters in the character set associated
    with a list of integers denoting the position of each
    corresponding character in the ordered list of characters. The
    position number 0 is associated with the first character in the
    list. As position numbers, the list of integer values is
    necessarily dense. These position numbers are referenced in the
    descriptions of the CHAR and ICHAR intrinsic functions. The
    position numbers may be, but are not necessarily, equivalent to
    the bit patterns used to represent the associated characters in
    the computer hardware.

(2) Moot because the answer to (1) is Yes.

(3) Moot because the answer to (1) is Yes.

(4) No.  For characters that are not part of the ASCII character set,
    IACHAR  returns a processor-dependent value that need not be in
    the ASCII collating sequence.  ACHAR, being the inverse of
    IACHAR, should accept such values.

QUESTION:

Is the following observation true?

[F90 185:last sentence of 13.5.7] and [WG5/N1176, 219:22+] says ``In
particular, whereas the models are identical for w_{z-1}=0, they do
not correspond for w_{z-1}=1 and ...''

This statement assumes r==2 in the model for integer data defined in
 13.7.1, it is not true for general r. The above sentence should be
 changed to something like

``In particular, whereas the models are identical for r=2 and
  w_{z-1}=0, they do not correspond for r/=2 or w_{z-1}=1, and =
...''

ANSWER: Yes.

DISCUSSION:

The integer model in 13.7.1 describes integer values using a
signed-magnitude, base r representation. The bit model in 13.5.7
describes a method for characterizing a sequence of bits. The two
models do not generally correspond and the final sentence of 13.5.7 is
defective.

    character of the current record is not a blank, list-directed
    output is not required, though possibly permitted, to replace
    that character with a blank.)

ANSWER: No.

DISCUSSION:

Following the non-advancing output operation, the location for the
start of the next output operation is within the current record.  The
list-directed output operation begins at this location. List-directed
output is an advancing output operation. Following the list-directed
output the file position is after the just-written record.

If the location for the start of the list-directed output operation is
at the beginning of the record, a blank is written to the first
location.  Otherwise, no characters are inserted between the end of
the non-advancing output and the start of the list-directed output.

EDITS: None.

QUESTION:
    If a program does a nonadvancing WRITE followed by a
    list-directed WRITE, must the list-directed WRITE write to the
    current record or may it start a new record?


ANSWER: The list-directed WRITE is not required to start a new record.

DISCUSSION:

Following the non-advancing output operation, the location for the
start of the next output operation is within the current record.  The
list-directed output operation begins at this location. New records
may be created during processing of the list-directed output
statement.

EDITS: None.

TITLE: Multiple occurrence of namelist group object in namelist group
KEYWORDS: NAMELIST
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot - done

QUESTION:

JP-17)

  5.4 3rd paragraph after R545 and constraints states that:

  "A namelist group object may be a member of more than one
   namelist group."

  Can a namelist group object occur more than once in one
  namelist group?

  Is the following NAMELIST statement standard conforming?

        NAMELIST /NLIST/A,B,A

ANSWER: Yes.

DISCUSSION:

  Sections 5.4 "NAMELIST Statement" and 10.9 "Namelist Formatting"
  in Fortran 95 do not disallow multiple occurrences of a namelist
  group object in a namelist group.  This is also true in Fortran 90.
  Therefore the multiple occurrences are standard conforming.

EDITS:  None.

NUMBER: JP-24
TITLE: The bnf term shared-term-do-construct
KEYWORDS: DO, BNF
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot - done

QUESTION:

JP-24)
  In 8.1.4.2, second constraint below R833 states that:

  "The do-term-shared-stmt shall be identified with a label
   and all of the label-do-stmts of the shared-term-do-construct
   shall refer to the same label."

  This implies a label-do-stmts of the outer-most outer-shared-
  do-construct will permit not to refer to the same label, because
  shared-term-do-construct does not include outer-most outer-
  shared-do-construct.

  So the term "shared-term-do-construct" should be changed to
  "inner-share-do-construct and outer-shared-do-construct."

DISCUSSION:

  There is a typographical error in the question - "8.1.4.2"
  should read "8.1.4.1.2".

  The following amplification of the question was provided at the
  August 2000 WG5 meeting:

  The present BNF does not preclude the following as a single
  construct:

    do 10 i=1,5     ! outer
     do 20 j=1,5    ! outer
      do 20 k=1,5   ! outer
       do 20 l=1,5  ! inner
         ...
    20 continue     ! shared

ANSWER:

  Agreed.

EDITS:

  [127:29.5] Replace "<shared-term-do-construct>" by
   "<inner-shared-do-construct> and <outer-shared-do-construct>".

  {The intention is to alter the second line of the second constraint
   following R833.  The line numbering is awry in the F95 copy being
   used.}

{The equivalent edits appear in Fortran 2003 04-007 [166:6-7].}
