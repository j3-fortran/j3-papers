Subject: C16 - UTI 76 : definition of associated objects
Date:    28-jul-2006

---------------------

Unresolved Technical Issue 76 (page 497) points out that defining a
bits object does not have the effect of defining an object with which
it is either pointer or argument associated.

Reply: The ultimate problem raised appears to be a missing edit in
16.6.6 "Events that cause variables to become undefined". From list
item (1) at [506:8-14] one would conclude that defining an object of
type bits causes an associated object with a type other than bits to
become undefined. The list of exceptions to that general rule does not
cover the bits compatible case. This is inconsistent with the rest of
the implementation of bits, and needs to be corrected.


Edit:
-----

Option 1: This covers all forms of association:

[506:8-9] Replace "all associated variables of different type become
undefined" with "all associated variables of a different type that is
not bits compatible become undefined."

Option 2: This covers only argument association:

[506:14] Append another exception sentence to list item (1): "When a
dummy argument of type bits is associated with an actual argument of a
different type, definition of the dummy argument does not cause the
actual argument to become undefined."
