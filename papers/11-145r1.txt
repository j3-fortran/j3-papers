[v:Introduction p3] Replace entire paragraph with
  "The provision in the existing system for interoperability with a C
   formal parameter that is a pointer to void is inconvenient to use
   and error-prone.  C functions with such parameters are widely used.".
{First sentence was completely wrong, and I see no need to reference
 MPI - their problems are mostly of their own making in any case.}

[1:14-15] "ISO/IEC TR 29113" -> "this Technical Specification".
{Form required by ISO directives 6.6.7.2.}

[2:3] "ISO/IEC TR 29113" -> "This Technical Specification".
[2:4-5] "ISO/IEC TR 29113" -> "this Technical Specification".
[2:8] "ISO/IEC TR 29113" -> "This Technical Specification".
etc.  I believe these are all done via macros...

[5:16] "When"->"If".
{Contradicts the time specification "is deallocated on entry", i.e.
 not "when invoked".}

[5:16,19] "ALLOCATABLE"->"allocatable".
{We use lower case for "allocatable thingy", upper case for
 "ALLOCATABLE attribute".}

[5:24] Before "SHAPE" insert "the intrinsic function".
{That is how we refer to intrinsic functions.}

[6:3] Before "SIZE" insert "the intrinsic function".
{Ditto.}

[6:9] Before "UBOUND" insert "the intrinsic function".
{Ditto.}

[7:1] "Intrinsic"->"intrinsic".

[7:3] "RANK generic intrinsic procedure" ->
      "generic intrinsic function RANK".
[7:5] "RANK intrinsic function" -> "intrinsic function RANK".
{Fix reference forms.}

[7:6] "a pure function" -> "pure".
{That's how we say that.}

[9:3] Disembolden "C descriptor".
{We don't do that.}

[16:23] Disembolden "interoperable".
{We don't do that.}

[17:1-2] "C International Standard" -> "ISO/IEC 9899:1999".
{Incorrect form of citation.}
