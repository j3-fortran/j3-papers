Edits to J3/08-007:

[277:10-11] In 10.7.2.4 B, O, and Z editing, replace paragraph 4 with:

  "The value is INT (X) if the input list item is of type integer and
   REAL (X) if the input list item is of type real or complex, where X is a
   <boz-literal-constant> that specifies the same bit sequence as the
   digits of the input field."

[277:14] In 10.7.2.4 B, O, and Z editing, paragraph 5,
  replace
    "with the same value and without leading zeros"
  by
    "that specifies the same bit sequence but without leading zero bits".

Delete UTI 146 if resolved.
