    |	Issues resolved in this revision:

    |     - changed READ/WRITE statements ASYNCHRONOUS specifer
    |	    to ASYNCHRONOUS="YES|NO" form, to avoid ambiguity.
    |
    |     - scrapped old text about what variables could not be
    |       defined, referenced, passed as actual arg, etc., due
    |       to problems describing which variables the restrictions
    |       applied to.  Replaced this with a new term, the
    |       "pending I/O storage sequence", a NON-contiguous collection
    |       of storage units, the actual memory being referenced by the
    |       I/O list items.
    |
    |       Also added a new term, "pending I/O storage sequence
    |       AFFECTOR". An affector variable is a
    |       variable in a scoping unit where at least one
    |	    executable statement
    |	    was executed while the I/O operation is pending, and any
    |	    "use" of a variable in that scoping unit (if it had been
    |	    executed, due to optimizater hoisting the "use" of the
    |       variable), would have referenced or defined any storage
    |	    unit in the pending I/O storage sequence.


	Remaining issues:
    |	  - Finish the edits for affector variables, and prohibiting
    |       copyin/copyout procedure calls of affector variables while
    |       the pending I/O is active.

     	 5.1.2.12    ASYNCHRONOUS attribute
     	
    |	All variables which are pending I/O storage sequence affectors
    |   shall have the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute (9.4.1.10) in a scoping
    |   unit in which they appear, if:
    |	  1) they appear in an executable statement or in a
    |        specification expression, and

	sequence (the actual memory locations to which asynchronous I/O
	is being performed).  This information is used to disable certain

    |	Add a new section, 5.2.10 (and renumber 5.2.10 and later
	sections):
	
    |	  5.2.10  ASYNCHRONOUS  statement
	  
	  R5xx  asynchronous-stmt is  ASYNCHRONOUS  [::]
	                                         <object-name-list>
	  
	  The ASYNCHRONOUS statement specifes the ASYNCHRONOUS
	  attribute for a list of objects.
	  
	In rule R905 (OPEN statement connect-spec), add, after PAD=
	(on its own line)(pg. 140):
	  or  ASYNCHRONOUS = <scalar-default-char-expr>

						      page 4 of 16
     	
	Add section 9.3.4.11 (page 142/143):
	
     	  9.3.4.11  ASYNCHRONOUS= specifier in the OPEN statement
	
     	  The <scalar-default-char-expr> shall evaluate to
    |  	  YES or NO.  If an ASYNCHRONOUS= specifier with a value of YES
    |	  is specified, then READ and WRITE statements for opened unit
    |	  may include an ASYNCHRONOUS= specifier with a value of YES in
    |     the control information list.  An ASYNCHRONOUS= specifier with
    |	  a value of NO is always permitted in READ and WRITE statements.
	
    |	  The presence of an ASYNCHRONOUS= specifier with a value of
    |	  YES in a READ or WRITE statement permits, but does not
	  require, a processor to perform the data transfer
	  asynchronously.  The WAIT, CLOSE, and file positioning
    |	  statements may be used to wait for pending asynchronous data
	  transfer operations to complete, and the INQUIRE statement may
    |	  be used to inquire whether or not pending asynchronous data
	  transfer operations have completed.
	
	Note to the reader: the above rules imply only external unit
	input / output (not including the "*" unit) may specify an
	ASYNCHRONOUS= specifier for READs and WRITEs, since internal
	files and the "*" external unit are not OPENed.
	
	In section 9.3.5 (CLOSE statement), page 143, add the
	following paragraph and
	notes after line 5:
	
	  Execution of a CLOSE statement causes the processor to
    |	  wait for all pending asynchronous data transfer operations for
	  the specified unit to complete.
	
	  If a CLOSE statement is executed for a unit with
    |	  pending asynchronous data transfer operations, that CLOSE
	  statement is considered to be the corresponding wait operation
	  for the READ or WRITE statements that initiated those
	  pending asynchronous data transfer operations, and the CLOSE
	  statement is considered to be a data transfer statement
	  for purposes of end of file, end of record, and error
	  processing.
	
	
	In rule 912 (io-control-spec) (page 144), add:
	
    |	  or  ASYNCHRONOUS=<scalar-default-char-initialization-expr>
	  or  ID = <scalar-default-int-variable>

						      page 5 of 16
	Add the following constraints after the constraint on line
	19, page 145:
	
	  Constraint: An ASYNCHRONOUS= specifier shall be present
	  if an ID= specifier is present.
	  
	  Constraint: An ASYNCHRONOUS= specifier shall not be
	  specified if the <io-unit> is an <internal-file-unit>
	  or "*".

	  Constraint: The <scalar-default-char-initialization-expr> in
          an ASYNCHRONOUS= specifier shall have the value "YES" or "NO".

     	Note to the reader: an ID=
	specifier, typically used in a corresponding WAIT statement,
	is NOT required in an asynchronous READ or WRITE statement.
	The user would have to CLOSE the unit (or execute another
	wait operation) before referencing any storage locations in
	an input list or namelist, and to NOT define any storage
	locations referenced by an output list or namelist in an
	output statement.  This allows a knowledgeable user to
	READ or WRITE massive amounts of data to a file, without
	ever waiting for completion, as long as they close the file
	or perform some other wait operation before modifying or
	referencing any storage locations referenced by an
	input / output list or namelist.
	
	In section 9.4.1.9 (page 147), first sentence, insert
	
	  without an ASYNCHRONOUS= specifier
	
	before "terminates", and add the following as the last
	sentence of that paragraph:
	
    |	  If an ASYNCHRONOUS= specifier with a value of YES is present
    |	  in a non-advancing input statement, the variable specified in
    |	  the SIZE= specifier becomes defined with the count of
    |	  characters transfered when the wait operation corresponding
    |     to the non-advancing input statement is executed.

	  Note: A CLOSE, INQUIRE or a file positioning statement,
	  as well as a WAIT statement, can be a wait operation
	  (9.3.5).

	Insert a new section:

	  9.4.1.10  Asynchronous specifier
	  
    |	  An ASYNCHRONOUS= specifier with a value of YES indicates
	  that this data transfer operation can be performed
	  asynchronously.  Records read or written by asynchronous
	  data transfer statements are read, written, and
	  processed in the same order as they would have been if the
	  data transfer statement did not contain the ASYNCHRONOUS
	  specifier.
	  
    |	  An ASYNCHRONOUS= specifier with a value of YES shall not
	  be present in a READ or WRITE statement unless the OPEN
          statement for the unit referenced in the READ or WRITE
    |	  statement contained an ASYNCHRONOUS= specifier with a
    |	  value of YES.

    |	  When a data transfer statement with an ASYNCHRONOUS=
    |	  specifier with a value of YES is executed, the set of
    |	  storage units specified by the item list or namelist in the
    |	  data  transfer statememt, as well as the storage units
    |	  specified by the SIZE= specifier, is called the
    |	  "pending I/O storage sequence" for this asynchronous data
    |	  transfer statement.

    |	  In a scoping unit containing a data transfer statement with
    |	  an ASYNCHRONOUS= specifier with a value of YES, all variables:
    |	    1) contained in the input/output list, or
    |	    2) contained in a namelist specified in the data transfer
    |	       statement, or
    |	    3) in a SIZE= specifier,
    |	  implicitly receive the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute.

    	  
    |     A "pending I/O storage sequence affector variable" is a
    |     variable appearing in a scoping unit where at least one
    |	  executable statement is executed while an asynchronous I/O
    |	  operation is pending, and:
    |	    1)  any reference or definition of the variable in that
    |		instance of that scoping unit references or defines
    |		any storage unit in the pending I/O storage sequence for
    |		a pending asynchronous data transfer operation, or
    |	    2)  the variable appears as an actual argument of a procedure
    |		which:
    |		a) is referenced while an asynchronous data transfer
    |		   operation is pending, or
    |		b) initiates an asynchronous I/O operation that is still
    |		   pending when that procedure returns
    |           and the variable is associated or partially associated
    |		with any storage unit in the pending I/O storage sequence
    |		for that asynchronous data transfer operation.

    |	  If an ASYNCHRONOUS= specifier with a value of YES is
	  specified in a data transfer statement, data transfers may
	  occur during execution of the statement, during execution
	  of the corresponding wait operation, or anywhere in-between.
	  The data transfer operation is considered to be a pending
	  data transfer operation until a corresponding wait operation
	  is performed.
	
	  When a data transfer operation is performed asynchronously,
	  any errors that would have caused the ERR= branch on a
	  synchronous READ or WRITE to be taken, and the IOSTAT
	  variable to be defined with a non-zero value, may instead
	  occur during execution of the corresponding wait operation
	  (a WAIT, CLOSE, INQUIRE or file positioning statement) and
	  take the ERR= branch of that wait operation instead.  If an
	  ID= specifier is not present in the initiating READ or WRITE
	  statement, the errors may occur during the execution of any
	  subsequent data transfer statement for that same unit,
	  and not just during the corresponding wait operation.

	Insert a new section 9.5, and renumber every section
	thereafter appropriately:
	  
	  9.5  WAIT statement
	  
	  Execution of a WAIT statement causes the processor to
	  wait for one of more previously initiated (pending)
	  asynchronous data transfers to complete.
	  
	      R919  <wait-statement> is  WAIT (<wait-spec-list>)
	  
	      R920  <wait-spec> is  [UNIT = ]
	                             <external-file-unit>
	                      or  IOSTAT =
			             <scalar-default-int-variable>
	                      or  ERR = <label>
	                      or  END = <label>
			      or  EOR = <label>
	                      or  ID = <scalar-default-int-variable>
	
	  Constraint: A <wait-spec-list> shall contain exactly one
	  <external-file-unit> specifier, and may contain at most
	  one of each of the other specifiers.
	  
	  Constraint: If the optional characters UNIT= are
	  omitted from the unit specifier, the unit specifier
	  shall be the first item in the <wait-spec-list>.
	
	
	    (note to Richard Maine: insert other appropriate
	     constraints, similar to the position-spec constraints,
	     and one for the END=label branch target)
	
	  The IOSTAT=, ERR=, and END= specifiers are described in
	  x, x, and x respectively.
	

	  If an ID= specifier is not present, the processor waits
	  for all pending data transfers on the specified unit to
	  complete, if any.  If an ID= specifier is present, the
	  processor waits for the corresponding READ or WRITE
	  operation to complete.  The corresponding READ or WRITE
	  operation is that READ or WRITE that returned the same
	  value for the ID= specifier for the specified unit.
	  The value specified for the ID= specifier shall be a
	  value returned by a READ or WRITE statement for the
	  specified unit, for which a corresponding wait
	  operation has not been executed.
	
	  The data transfer operation specified in the
	  corresponding READ or WRITE statement may happen when
	  the WAIT statement is executed, when the corresponding
	  READ or WRITE statement was previously executed, or
	  anytime in-between.  The WAIT statement is considered
	  to be a data transfer statement for purposes of end of
	  file, end of record, and error processing.

	  during execution of the corresponding wait operation.
	  If the end of file condition occurs during the wait
	  operation, and there is not an END= or IOSTAT= specifier
	  in the statement that is the corresponding wait
	  operation, then program execution terminates.  Error
	  conditions are handled in a similar manner.

	and renumber all subsequent rules.  
	
	In the old section 9.5 (File Positioning statements), add
	the following after the last sentence in that section:
	
	  Execution of a file positioning statement causes the
	  processor to wait for all pending data transfer
	  operations for the specified unit to complete.
	  
	  If a file positioning statement is executed for a unit
	  with pending data transfer operations, that statement
	  is considered to be the corresponding wait operation
	  for the READ or WRITE statements that initiated the
    	  pending data transfers, and is also considered to be a
	  data transfer statement for purposes of end of file,
	  error, and end of record processing.
	  
     	
	In section 9.6.1, add the following to rule 924:
	  or  ID = <scalar-default-int-variable>
	  or  PENDING = <scalar-default-logical-variable>
     	  or  ASYNCHRONOUS = <scalar-default-char-variable>
	
	and add these constraints around line 40 on page 156:
	  Constraint: The ID= and PENDING= specifiers shall not
	  appear in an INQUIRE statement if the FILE = specifier
	  is present.
	  
	  Constraint: If an ID= specifier is present, a PENDING=
	  specifier shall also be present.

						      page 13 of 16
	  
	On page 159, add section 9.6.1.23
	  9.6.1.23    ID= and PENDING= specifiers in the INQUIRE
	              statement
	  If an ID= specifier is not present in an INQUIRE
	  statement, the variable specified in the PENDING=
	  specifier is assigned the value true if there are any
	  pending asynchronous data transfers for the specified
	  unit that have not completed.  If an ID= specifier is
	  present, the variable specified in the PENDING=
	  specifier is assigned the value true if the data
	  transfer identified by the ID= specifier for the
	  specified unit has not yet completed.  In all other
	  cases, the variable specified in the PENDING= specifier
	  is set to false.
	  
	  When the variable specified in the PENDING= specifier is
	  set to false, then any pending data transfer operations
	  for this unit are considered to have completed, and
	  this INQUIRE is the corresponding wait operation for
	  the corresponding READ or WRITE statements.  When an
	  ID= specifier is present, the corresponding operation
	  is the READ or WRITE statement identified by the unit
	  and ID= specifier value.  When an ID= specifier was not
	  present, then this INQUIRE statement is the
	  corresponding wait operation for all pending data
	  transfer operations for the specified unit.  When an INQUIRE
	  statement is considered to be a wait operation, it is also
	  considered to be a data transfer statement for purposes
	  of end of file, end of record, and error processing.
	
     	On page 159, add section 9.6.1.24

     	  9.6.1.24  ASYNCHRONOUS= specifier in the INQUIRE statement

     	  The <scalar-default-char-variable> in the ASYNCHRONOUS=
     	  specifier is assigned the value "YES" if the file is connected
    |     and was opened with an ASYNCHRONOUS= specifier with a value
          of "YES"; otherwise, it is assigned the value "NO".

	In section 9.6.1.14 (page 158), add the following sentence as the
	last sentence of the paragraph.

	  If there are pending data transfer operations for the
	  specified unit, the value assigned to the variable specified
	  in a NEXTREC= specifier is computed as if all the pending
	  data transfers had already completed.
	  
	
	
	Note to the reader:  the POSITION= specifier does not appear
	to need any edits.

	Note to the reader.  In section 14, we discuss events
	causing definition and undefinition of variables.  In item
	(3) of 14.7.5, we discuss when input causes an item to be
	defined, in terms of when the data is transferred, so no
	edit is needed in (3).  Note that the second part of (3)
	applies to internal units, which cannot be read from or written
	to asynchronously.

	In section 12.3.1.1, add this item under the list (2)
	  (f) A dummy argument that has the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute, or

        and delete the trailing " or" from item (e) in that list.

	In section 14.7.5, item (5), change "an input/output
	statement" to "an input/output statement without an
    |	ASYNCHRONOUS= specifier, or an input/output statement
    |	with an ASYNCHRONOUS= specifier with a value of NO".
	
	In section 14.7.5, item (8), change "statement" to
    |	"statement without an ASYNCHRONOUS specifier or with an
    |	ASYNCHRONOUS= specifier with a value of NO".
	
	In section 14.7.5, insert this new item (9), and renumber
	the remaining items:
	  (9) Execution of a READ statement containing both an
    |	  ASYNCHRONOUS= specifier with a value of YES and a SIZE=
	  specifier may cause the variable specified in the SIZE=
	  specifier to become defined, or the corresponding wait
	  operation may cause that variable to become defined.
	  Either the READ statement or the corresponding wait
	  operation will cause that variable to become defined.
	
	In section 14.7.6, item (4), change "input/output statement"
	to "input/output statement or its corresponding wait
	operation".
	
	In section 14.7.6, item (5), change "input/output statement"
	to "input/output statement or its corresponding wait
	operation".
	
	In section 14.7.6, item (7), change "input statement" to
	"input statement or its corresponding wait operation".
	
	In section 14.7.6, add a new item (16) (the editor may
	relocate to another part of the list if desired):

    |	  Execution of a READ statement with an ASYNCHRONOUS= specifier
    |     with a value of YES causes all variables in the item list or
	  namelist, and the variable specified in the SIZE= specifier,
	  if any, to become undefined.  Variables in a namelist group
    |	  specified in such a READ statement that are not defined
	  by the data transfer statement do not become undefined.

	-------------------------------------------------------------
	Rationale for Asynchronous I/O: may be inserted in the
	                                appropriate annex if desired.
	
	Rather than limit support for asynchronous I/O to what has
	been traditionally provided by facilities such as BUFFERIN-
	BUFFEROUT, this standard builds upon existing Fortran syntax.
	This permits alternative approaches for implementing
	asynchronous I/O, and simplifys the task of adapting existing
	standard conforming programs to utilize asynchronous I/O.
	
	Not all processors will actually perform I/O asynchronously,
	nor will every processor that does, be able to handle data
	transfer statements with complicated I/O item lists in an
	asynchronous manner.  Such processors can still be standard
	conforming.  Hopefully, the documentation for each Fortran
	processor will describe when, if ever, I/O will
	be performed asynchronously.

	------------------------------------------------------------
	Conceptual Model
	
	This proposal allows for at least two different conceptual
	models for asynchronous I/O.

	Model 1: the processor will perform asynchronous I/O when the
	item list is simple (perhaps one contiguous named array) and the
	I/O is unformatted (possibly MAGTAPE).  The implementation cost
	is reduced, and this is the scenario most likely to be
	beneficial on traditional "big-iron" machines.
	
	Model 2: The processor is free to do any of the following:
	  on output, create a buffer inside the I/O library, completely
	  formatted, and then start an async write of the buffer, and
	  immediately return to the next statement in the program.  The
	  processor is free to wait for previously issued WRITEs,  or not.
	OR
	  pass off the I/O list addresses to another processor/process,
	  that will process the list items independently of the processor
	  which executes the user's code.
	  The addresses of the list items must be computed before the
	  asynchronous READ/WRITE statement completes.
	  There is still an ordering requirement on list item processing,
	  to handle things like READ (...) N,(a(i),i=1,N).

	One source of confusion is the role of the ID= values and
	wait operations.  The standard allows a user to issue a
	large number of asynchronous I/O requests, without waiting for any
	of them to complete, and then wait for any or all of them.
	It may be impossible, and undesirable to keep track of each of
	these I/O requests individually.

	                                                  J3/97-216r1
						      page 16 of 16
	
	The proposed support does not require all requests to be
	tracked by the runtime library.  When the user does NOT specify
	an ID= specifier on a READ or WRITE, the runtime is free to
	forget about this particular request once it has successfully
	completed.  If it gets an ERR or END condition, the processor
	is free to report this during any I/O operation to that unit.
	  
	When an ID= specifier is present, the processors runtime I/O
	library is required to keep track of any END or ERR conditions
	for that specific I/O request.
	However, if the I/O request succeeds without any exceptional
	conditions occuring, then the runtime can forget that
	ID= value if it wishes.  Typically, I expect a runtime to only
	keep track of the last request made, or perhaps a very few.
	Then, when a user WAITs for a particular request, either the
	library knows about it (and does the right thing w.r.t. error
	handling, etc.), or will assume it is one of those requests
	that successfully completed and was forgotten about (and will
	just return without signaling any end/err conditions).  It is
	incumbent on the user to pass valid ID= values.  There
	is no requirement on the processor to detect invalid ID= values.
	  
	There is of course, a processor dependent limit on how many
	outstanding I/O requests which generate an END or ERROR condition
	can be handled before the processor runs out of memory to keep
	track of such stuff.
	  
	The restrictions on the SIZE= variables are designed to allow
	the processor to update such variables at any time (after the
	request has been processed, but before the WAIT operation),
	and then forget about them.  That's why there is no SIZE=
	specifier allowed in the various WAIT operations.  Only
	exceptional conditions (errors or EOFs) are expected to be
	tracked by individual request by the runtime, and then
	only if an ID= specifier was present.
	  
	The END= and EOR= specifiers have not been added to all
	statements which can be WAIT operations.  Instead, the IOSTAT
	variable will have to be queried after a WAIT operation to handle
	this situation.  This choice was made because we expect the WAIT
	statement to be the usual method of waiting for I/O to complete
	(and WAIT does support the END= and EOR= specifiers).
	This particular choice is philosophical, and was not based on
	significant technical difficulties.

	Note that the requirement to set the IOSTAT variable correctly
	requires an implementation to remember which I/O requests got
	an EOR condition, so that a subsequent wait operation will
	return the correct IOSTAT value.  This means there is a
	processor defined limit on the number of outstanding non-advancing
	I/O requests which got an EOR condition (constrained by available
	memory to keep track of this info, similar to END/ERR conditions).
