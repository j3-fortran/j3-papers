Subject: Dynamic arrays and interfacing with C

The aim of this paper is to ensure that

   1. It is possible for a Fortran procedure, while being called from
      C, to allocate an array and make that array available to the C
      code; and

   2. It is possible for a C function, while being called from Fortran,
      to allocate an array and make that array available to the Fortran
      code.

Re 1: 
We already have a procedure for constructing a C pointer, but it 
is not applicable to an allocatable array, so an allocatable array
cannot be passed to C. We propose to remove this restriction, while
continuing to disallow pointer arrays and assumed-shape arrays since
these need not be a contiguous subarray of the original declared or
allocated parent array.

Re 2: 
Explicit-shape and assumed-size arrays are already interoperable with 
C. The underlying assumption is that it is the address of the first
element that is passed. Thus an array allocated in C can be passed to
an explicit-shape or assumed-size dummy argument. However, it cannot be
passed as a component of a structure. The mechanism in C is to have a
pointer component. We need a mechanism in Fortran to reference its
target. William Mitchell (J3/00-168) proposed a function that accepts a
C pointer and returns a Fortran pointer result. We think it would be
better to have a subroutine that performs a pointer assignment to a
given pointer.  Then, the pointer itself provides a natural
specification of the type and rank. We have included some restrictions
for the new subroutine to avoid the possibility of back-door pointer
associations that cannot happen within Fortran 95 and which compiler
optimizations may rely upon.

We have extended the examples in C.10.2.1 and C.10.3 (which should be
C.10.2.2) to illustrate the new features.

EDITS

372:24. Change 'C_LOC function is' to 'C_LOC, C_ASSOCIATED, and 
C_F_POINTER procedures are'.

374:4. Change 'inquiry functions' to 'procedures'.

374:7 Add: 'The C_F_POINTER subroutine provides a means of associating a
Fortran pointer with the target of a C pointer.'

374:11-12. Replace sentence by 'X shall be a procedure that is
interoperable, a variable that has the TARGET attribute and is
interoperable, or an allocatable array that has the TARGET attribute 
and is of a type and type parameters that is interoperable.

375:17+. Add:

C_F_POINTER (CPTR, FPTR [, SHAPE])

  Description.  Associates a pointer with the target of a C pointer
       and specifies its shape.

  Class. Subroutine.

  Arguments

  CPTR shall be a scalar of type C_PTR. It is an INTENT(IN)
       argument. Its value shall be the C address of a C entity
       that is interoperable with variables of the type and
       type parameters of FPTR. It shall not be the C address of
       a Fortran variable that does not have the TARGET
       attribute.

  FPTR shall be a pointer. It becomes pointer associated with
       the target of CPTR. If it is an array, its shape is specified 
       by SHAPE.

  SHAPE (optional) shall be of type integer and rank one. It is an
       INTENT(IN) argument. If SHAPE is present, its size shall be
       equal to the rank of FPTR. If FPTR is an array, SHAPE shall
       be present.

   NOTE. Execution of this subroutine could cause FPTR to become 
   associated with a target that has a different type and type 
   parameters. In such a case, definition of either FPTR or the
   original target causes the other to become undefined.

457:40. Replace by

       INTEGER (C_INT), ALLOCATABLE, TARGET :: RECVCOUNTS(:)
       ...
       ALLOCATE ( RECVCOUNTS(100) )

457:41. At line end, delete '}'.

458:15. Replace 'array RECVCOUNTS, with' by  'allocatable array
        RECVCOUNTS, which'.

458:19. Replace 'C.10.3' by  'C.10.2.2'.

458:21. Change 'DELTA' to 'DELTA, ARRAYS'

458:27+ Add:
   TYPE, BIND(C) :: PASS
      INTEGER (C_INT) :: LENC, LENF
      TYPE (C_PTR) :: C, F
   END TYPE PASS
   TYPE (PASS), INTENT(INOUT) :: ARRAYS
   REAL (C_FLOAT), ALLOCATABLE, TARGET, SAVE :: ETA(:)
   REAL (C_FLOAT), POINTER :: C_ARRAY(:)
   ...
   ! Associate C_ARRAY with an array allocated in C
   CALL C_F_POINTER (ARRAYS%C, C_ARRAY, (/ARRAYS%LENC/) )
   ...
   ! Allocate an array and make it available in C
   ARRAYS%LENF = 100
   ALLOCATE (ETA(ARRAYS%LENF))
   ARRAYS%F = C_LOC(ETA)

458:30+. Add
   C Struct Declaration

     struct pass {int lenc, lenf; float* f, c}

458:32 Change 'delta[]' to 'delta[], pass *arrays'.

458:34 Change 'delta' to 'delta, &arrays'.

459:14+ Add:

The fifth Fortran dummy parameter is ARRAYS, which is a structure
for accessing an array allocated in C and an array allocated in Fortran.
The lengths of these arrays are held in the components LENC and LENF
and their C addresses are held in components C and F.
