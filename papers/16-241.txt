Subject: Missing constraint on VALUE
Date: 2016 August 31
Reference: 16-007r2


Interp F08/0096 added a constraint to prohibit an array dummy argument
with VALUE in a BIND(C) procedure. This was included in Corrigendum 3
for F2008.  This was done as an edit to an existing constraint.
Unfortunately, TS 29113 affected the same constraint, effectively
eliminating the change from Corrigendum 3.  The restriction from
F08/0096 (and Corrigendum 3) needs to be restored.  The edit could be
made either in the VALUE attribute subclause, or in the subclause
limiting procedures with BIND(C).  Alternatives are provided for both
options.

Note that alternative 2 places the constraint in the subclause on
Function subprograms, along with other constraints on BIND(C)
procedures. This seems unnatural. Most of those constraints are
independent of whether the procedure is a function or subroutine It
might be better to have a separate subclause that includes the
constraints on procedures with a suffix of
proc-language-binding-spec. If that is done, the edit for alternative
2 should be made in that subclause.


Edits to 16-007r2:

ALTERNATIVE 1:

[112:22+] In 8.5.18 VALUE attribute, after the last constraint, add a
new constraint:

"C865a An array dummy argument of a procedure with the BIND attribute
shall not have the VALUE attribute."


ALTERNATIVE 2:

[330:37+] In 15.6.2.2 Function subprogram, after constraint C1561
beginning "If <proc-language-binding-spec> is specified for a
procedure..." add a new constraint:

"C1561a If <proc-language-binding-spec> is specified for a procedure,
it shall not have an array dummy argument with the VALUE attribute."
