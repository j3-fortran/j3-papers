Introduction:
-------------

Over time, the complexity of many Fortran applications has grown
considerably.  A consequence of this growth in complexity is that the
relative fraction of non-numerical lines of code has also inreased
substantially.  Indeed, except for the bottom-most procedures many
procedures consist of nothing except a sequence of procedure calls to
other layers of the application or to external libraries.

The ability to meaningfully trap run-time errors becomes extremely
important in such large applications.  Indeed nearly well-supported
libraries with Fortran interfaces either include a so-called
return-code integer dummy argument or use functions whose integer
return value is used for the same purpose.  Many applications follow a
similar practice for their own infrastructure layers.

Whereas many developers ignore these return-codes at their own peril,
well-run development shops have mandatory practices for checking all
return codes.  Because of the desire to determine the call path, the
check consists of (1) a test of the value, (2) a call to the error
handler, (3) setting the return-code of the current procedure, and (4)
a RETURN statement.


Example:
--------

Combined with the
statement above about the growing fraction of code that is in the form
of calls ot other layers, the number of lines of code spent trapping
potential error conditions is actually quite large in some codes.

Here is a simple example of what such high-level code then tends to
look like:

CALL proc1(dum1, dum2, ..., rc=status)
IF (status /= SUCCESS) THEN
   CALL ERROR_HANDLER('proc 1 failed, status)
   rc = status
   RETURN
END IF
CALL proc2(dum1, dum2, ..., rc=status)
IF (status /= SUCCESS) THEN
   CALL ERROR_HANDLER('proc 2 failed', status)
   rc = status
   RETURN
END IF
...


As you can see, the lines of code for error handling can actually
exceed those for the actual main line of work by a substantial margin!
Further, this example is actually oversimplified in some respects.
E.g., development teams often want to know the file and line number
where the failure occurs, and thus resort to __FILE__ and __LINE__
CPP/FPP macros.  And at that point, one can introduce a custom CPP
macro of the form:


#define _VERIFY(msg,s) IF(s/=SUCCESS)THEN; \
        CALL ERROR_HANDLER(msg,__FILE__,__LINE__,s);rc=s;RETURN;ENDIF

And the example then looks like:


CALL proc1(dum1, dum2, ..., rc=status)
_VERIFY('proc 1 failed',status)
CALL proc2(dum1, dum2, ..., rc=status)
_VERIFY('proc 2 failed',status)
...


This is a significant improvement, but the approach still has significant
drawbacks:

1) The remaining error handling lines still tends to significantly
   obscure the natural flow of the algorithm.

2) If a developer accidentally omits a _VERIFY() statement somewhere
   in the chain, then code may continue to execute until some other
   error is encountered.  This can complicate forensics when the small
   trace for the first error is hidden in a deluge of subsequent output.

3) Although CPP/FPP provide the file and line number, it would also be
   useful to know the module name and procedure name where the error
   was encountered.



Desired outcome:
----------------

Provide language features to support robust error handling in a less
verbose manner.


Note that the desire is to ameliorate the issue in higher-level
procedures where performance overhead for error handling is minimal.
If potential solutions have inherent overhead then it should be
possible to disallow the capability within performance intensive
procedures.
