Number:
Title:        Rank > 7
Submitted By: J3
Status:       For Consideration

Basic Functionality:

Relax the restriction on the maximum rank of an array.

Rationale:

Requests for increasing this limit have been made by international bodies for
years.

Estimated Impact:  (Listed as 4 on the JKR scale)  The standard would require
changes in two places.  This will not impact any existing code.  Any other
impact should be apparent only when arrays of rank greater than seven are
declared and referenced.

Detailed Specification:

Changes would be needed to the following places:
[18:5] An array may have up to seven dimensions ...
[78:4] C541 (R510) The maximum rank is seven.
