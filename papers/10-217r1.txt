Subject: Inappropriate use of "may"
Date: 2010 October 10


Discussion:

The draft TR incorrectly uses "may" in several places.


The use at [12:31] might be correct, but I doubt it.  {The intent is
to allow the user to modify the base address in a pointer. See paper
10-235 for added restrictions on modifications of members.}

The use at [12:32] is almost certainly wrong, but there are other
problems with that paragraph so it is the subject of a separate paper.
{See paper 10-218 (Problem 2)}

The use at [17:20] is definitely wrong - one cannot give permission to
do something in non-normative text.  But that paragraph has other
problems so is the subject of a separate paper.  {See paper 10-218
(Problem 3). Edits there replace this paragraph.}

Edits are provided for other incorrect uses of "may" that are not
covered above.


Edits to 10-165r2:

[3:8] 2.1p2, "may appear only" -> "shall appear only".
{Requirement.}

[3:17] 2.2p2, "may appear only" -> "shall appear only".
{Requirement.}

[11:1-] Immediately before 5.2.6 Functions, in NOTE 5.1,
  "may have the same value" -> "can have the same value".
{Possibility.}

[11:7] 5.2.6p2, "may become associated" -> "can become associated".
{Possibility.}
