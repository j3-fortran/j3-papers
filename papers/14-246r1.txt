Subject: Improving subclause names
Date: 2014 October 14

1. Introduction

Many subclauses have uninformative names, especially those invented to
follow the (entirely reasonable) ISO rule about no initial text in a
clause or subclause that itself has subclauses.  E.g. "General".

These uninformative names make it more difficult to refer to the text,
especially in edits.

We should revise these names.  Some of the introductory witter in these
subclauses could also be profitably revised.


2. Discussion

(a) [ 4. Types; 4.1 The concept of type; 4.1.1 General ]

    This subclause contains 2 paragraphs of introductory witter a plus
    3 paragraphs about type classification.  We could split that into
    two, or use a combined heading; better to split it.

(b) [ 4. Types; 4.4; Intrinsic types; 4.4.2 Numeric intrinsic types;
      4.4.2.1 General ]

    This subclause contains only unnecessary witter; the first sentence
    being unwanted rationale, the second sentence merely cross-referencing
    operations defined in clause 7.  It is also incomplete in that it
    completely omits references to intrinsic functions, but that's ok since
    we don't consider those to be "operations" (in defiance of both normal
    English and computing English, without any definition!).  It also omits
    user-defined operations.  Which we omit everywhere.

COMMENT: Although it would be technically fine to delete the subclause
         entirely, that would leave the "Types" clause without any per-type
         references to intrinsic operations.

    [ 4. Types; 4.4 Intrinsic types; 4.4.3 Character type;
      4.4.3.1 Character sets ]

    The last paragraph in this subclause is not about character sets but
    about intrinsic operations.  Either we should
    (i) change to "Character sets and operations",
    (ii) introduce a new subclause header "Character operations",
    (iii) or delete the paragraph entirely.

    Ditto Logical, but here the paragraph actually mentions all the
    operations by operator name.  Ugh.

    I think it is best to add a single new subclause 4.4.2 "Operations on
    intrinsic types" and dump all of these operation cross-references in
    there.

(c) [ 5.2 Type declaration statements; 5.2.1 Syntax; ... ]

    The first heading should be singular.  The second heading is ambiguous
    and misleading.  5.2.2 "Automatic data objects" need not be a subclause
    of 5.2 (it is generally applicable, not just to type declaration
    statements).  5.2.3 "Initialization" ditto.  The examples (5.2.4) can
    be moved they don't need a whole subclause to themselves (there being
    no text in the subclause it violates ISO guidelines anyway).  Therefore
    move the examples and flatten the structure.

    An alternative would be to change 5.2 to "Type declaration" and 5.2.1
    to "Type declaration statement".  Except that "Automatic data objects"
    applies equally to implicitly-typed objects (with a variable character
    length, for example) and the DIMENSION statement with variable bounds,
    and "Initialization" applies equally to DATA statements; none of which
    are described in other subclauses of 5.2, so I think flattening is
    slightly preferable.

(d) [ 7.1 Expressions; 7.1.1 General ]

    This is pretty ugly.  It talks about both syntax and semantics, and
    contains mostly introductory witter, the only things that we actually
    need are the first sentence and the last paragraph.  The introductory
    witter is all about the syntax, so really should be 7.1.2.1 instead,
    if we moved (or just deleted!) it we could rename 7.1.1 to be
    "Expression semantics".

3. Edits to 14-007r2

Note that insertions/removals of subclause headings will result in
automatic renumbering by LaTeX; that renumbering is not reflected in
the edits.

[51:2] 4.1 "The concept of type" -> "Characteristics of types",
[51:3] 4.1.1 "General" -> "The concept of type",
[51:7+] 4.1.1p2+ insert new subclause header "Type classification".

[55:20+] Insert new subclause
  "4.4.2 Intrinsic operations on intrinsic types

   Intrinsic numeric operations are defined as specified in
   \ref{D7:Interpretation of numeric intrinsic operations} for the numeric
   intrinsic types.  Relational intrinsic operations are defined as
   specified in \ref{D7:Relational intrinsic operations} for numeric and
   character intrinsic types.
   The intrinsic concatenation operation is defined as specified in
   \ref{D7:Character intrinsic operation} for the character type.
   Logical intrinsic operations are defined as specified in
   \ref{D7:Logical intrinsic operations} for the logical type."
{If we want to expand this to mention functions or user-defined operations,
 here is where we would put it.}

[55:22-24] Delete entire subclause 4.4.2.1 "General".

[59:17-18] 4.4.3.1 "Character sets", Delete p4.

[62:28-31] 4.4.4 Logical type, Delete p6.

[77:15] 4.5.6.1 "Declaration" -> "FINAL statement".
        Make sure this is properly indexed with \defstmt.

[79:18] 4.5.7.1 "Concepts" -> "Extensible, extended, and abstract types".

[91:2] 5.1 "General" -> "Attributes of procedures and data objects".

[91:12] 5.2 "Type declaration statements" -> "Type declaration statement".
        Make sure this uses \defstmt.

[91:13] Delete heading "5.2.1 Syntax"

[92:35+] Move NOTE 5.1 to here, with
         (i) an initial line "Examples of type declaration statements:";
         (ii) all the examples indented 7 spaces;
         (iii) make all the names unique to reduce confusion.

[92:36] "5.2.2" (Automatic data objects) -> "5.3".

[93:6] "5.2.3" (Initialization) -> "5.4".

[93:19] Delete heading "5.2.4 Examples of type declaration statements".
[93:19+0-many] This was moved to [92:35+].

[93:21] 5.3.1 "Constraints" -> "Attribute specification".
{More accurate.}

[131:4] 6.7.1.1 "Syntax" -> "Form of the ALLOCATE statement".

[134:8] 6.7.3.1 "Syntax" -> "Form of the DEALLOCATE statement".

[137:3] 7.1.1 "General" -> "Expression semantics".

[137:5-8] 7.1.1p1-3, Delete/move (see next edit to see where it goes)
            "An expression is formed ... themselves expressions."
          and join p3 to the remnants of p1.

[137:11] 7.2.1.1 "Expression categories" -> "Overall expression syntax",
         then include the removed text from 7.1.1 as a single paragraph
         before the current first paragraph.

[171:3] 8.1.1 "General" -> "Blocks".

[199:18] 9.2.1 "General" -> "Definition of a record".

[200:14] 9.3.1 "Basic concepts" -> "External file concepts".

[213:28] 9.6.1 "General" -> "Form of input and output statements".

[221:2] 9.6.4.1 "General" -> "Data transfer sequence of operations".

[242:17] 9.11.1 "General" -> "Occurrence of input/output conditions".
[242:18] Append sentence
         "Except as otherwise specified, when an error condition occurs or
          is detected is processor dependent.".
{Perhaps unnecessary, but nice to have it there in black-and-white.}

[252:18] 10.7.1 "General" -> "Purpose of data edit descriptors".

[265:10] 10.10.1 "General" -> "Purpose of list-directed formatting".

[269:17] 10.11.1 "General" -> "Purpose of namelist formatting".

[275:18] 11.2.1 "General" -> "Module syntax and semantics".

[276:14+1-10] Move all the NOTEs to the end of the subclause [276:19+].
{This is nothing to do with the name of the subclause, it is just that
 their current position is an unnecessary violation of ISO
 recommendations.}

[496:12+] Annex A, after bullet "the set of error conditions ... (9.11)",
          insert new bullet
  "- when an input/output error condition occurs or is detected (9.11)".
