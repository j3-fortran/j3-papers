Title: Remove unnecessary I/O restriction


Problem statement:

  According to the first paragraphs after NOTES 9.34 and 9.35
  in subclause 9.5.2 [193:5,12], the following
  program does not conform to the 2003 standard:

  program P
    type :: T
      integer, allocatable :: I(:)
    end type T
    type(t) :: X
    allocate ( x%i(10) )
    read *, x%i
  end program P

  The restriction against allocatable components in input/output
  lists or as namelist group objects is unnecessarily too strong.
  It would be sufficient to require them to be allocated.  It
  isn't necessary to add anything to the definition of how a
  list is expanded into a sequence of effective list items
  because that definition depends upon "component order", which
  extends across pointer and allocatable components.

Proposed edits:

  The edits are against 04-007.

  [193:5,12][Editor:  At the ends of the first paragraphs after
  NOTES 9.34 and 9.35 in subclause 9.5.2, replace "and shall
  not be pointers or allocatable" with ", shall not be pointers,
  and, if allocatable, shall be allocated".]

  [198:28][Editor: In the second paragraph of 9.5.3.6,
  replace "allocatable or a pointer" by "a pointer or a deallocated
  allocatable variable".]

Response:

  The above program is standard-conforming.  x%i is not a
  derived type;  it is of type integer.  The proposed edits will
  not be made.

  If the program included

    read *,x

  that would be non-conforming.  In order to accomplish this
  read, the user should define a UDTIO routine.
