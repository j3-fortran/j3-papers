Subject: Redefinition of active team variables
Date: 2017 June 27

Discussion:

The current draft standard clearly permits the redefinition of an active
team variable:

  11.1.5.2 Execution of a CHANGE TEAM construct page 188, p1, lines 7-9
  "If team-value is a variable, the current team is not changed by a
   redefinition of that variable during execution of the CHANGE TEAM
   construct."

There are several problems with permitting redefinition of an active team
variable:

  1) It is prohibited to use a redefined active team variable in a CHANGE
     TEAM construct outside the construct where it was redefined.
  2) Using a redefined active team variable in an inquiry function is
     undefined behavior.
  3) The definition of parent team is "current team at time of execution
     of the FORM TEAM statement that created the team".  Redefining an
     active team variable means the same team variable can define a team
     and any number of ancestor teams.
  4) Allowing redefinition of an active team variable requires runtime
     bookkeeping and managing temporary copies of team variables upon
     entry to and exit from a CHANGE TEAM construct.

Section 11.1.5.2 p1 second sentence states:

  "When the CHANGE TEAM statement is executed, the current team shall be
   the team that was current when those team variables were defined."

This prohibits modification of an active team variable inside the
CHANGE TEAM construct, exiting the construct, and then re-entering the
construct with the modified TEAM variable.

  USE,INTRINSIC :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
  TYPE(TEAM_TYPE) team_var
  ...
  FORM TEAM (num, team_var)
  ...
  DO i = 1, n
    CHANGE TEAM (team_var)       ! Legal only on first iteration of loop
      ...
      FORM TEAM (TEAM_NUMBER(), team_var)  ! Removes inactive images;
                                           ! permitted but of little use
      ...
    END TEAM
  END DO

During each iteration of the loop other than the first iteration, the team
that was current when team_var was defined is not the team that executes
the CHANGE TEAM statement. If it is desired to re-form the team to say,
remove failed images from the team, the team must be re-formed outside the
CHANGE TEAM construct.

If the above example were made to be legal for iterations 2...n of the
loop, in each of those iterations, by definition of parent team, upon
entering the CHANGE TEAM construct, the parent team is no longer an
active team for those iterations (the parent team is the team that was
the current team at the time of the execution of the FORM TEAM statement).

Redefinition of active team variables also leads to undefined behavior.
Consider the following program fragment, executed on 16 images.

  USE,INTRINSIC :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
  TYPE(TEAM_TYPE)  :: odd_even
  ...
  FORM TEAM (2-MOD(THIS_IMAGE(),2), odd_even) ! 2 teams, 8 images each
  CHANGE TEAM (odd_even)
    IF ((THIS_IMAGE()==1) .AND. (TEAM_NUMBER() == 1))
      PRINT *, NUM_IMAGES(odd_even)    ! prints 8
    ...
    FORM TEAM (2-MOD(THIS_IMAGE(),2), odd_even) ! form teams of 4 images
    IF ((THIS_IMAGE()==1) .AND. (TEAM_NUMBER()==1))
      PRINT *, NUM_IMAGES (odd_even)  ! prints 8 or 4?
    ...
    CHANGE TEAM (odd_even)
      IF ((THIS_IMAGE()==1) .AND. (TEAM_NUMBER()==1))
        PRINT *, NUM_IMAGES (odd_even) ! prints 4?
    END TEAM
  END TEAM

The output of the second and third print statements in the above program
fragment are not defined by the draft standard.

This program fragment also demonstrates the need for an implementation to
create copies of the team variable when a CHANGE TEAM statement is
executed.  The TEAM_TYPE is defined to be an extensible derived type,
which means there could be non-trivial execution time overhead introduced
to manage copies of team variables.

Proposed solution:

Prohibit redefinition of active team variables (technical change from
the TS).

Edits:

[xx:3-] At end of the final bullet of paragraph 2 that begins Changes
to features previously described by ISO/IEC TS 18508:2015:

  Add: "A team variable that appears in a CHANGE TEAM statement can no
        longer be defined or become undefined during execution of the
        CHANGE TEAM construct."

{Document change to the TS}

[188:8-9] 11.1.5.2 Execution of a CHANGE TEAM construct p1
 Change "the current team is not changed by a redefinition of that
         variable during execution of the CHANGE TEAM construct"
 to     "the variable shall not be defined or become undefined during
         execution of the CHANGE TEAM construct"
This makes lines 7-9 read:
  "The current team for the statements of the CHANGE TEAM <block> is the
   team identified by the <team-value>.  If <team-value> is a variable,
   the variable shall not be defined or become undefined during execution
   of the CHANGE TEAM construct."
{Disallow modifying active team variables}
