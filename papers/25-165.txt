1. Background
-------------
Use case paper 23-174 "Asynchronous Tasks in Fortran" describes
"non-blocking collectives" that inspire the current requirements for what
we are now referring to as "asynchronous collective subroutines".

Paper WG5/N2245 provides a rationale for asynchronous collective
subroutines.

The current Fortran 202Y work list WG5/N2249 includes asynchronous
collective subroutines as accepted work item US04.

Paper J3/25-162 "US04: Requirements for Asynchronous Collective
Subroutines" presents an illustrative use case and a list of requirements.

The current paper provides specifications for the asynchronous collective
subroutines feature.

2. Completion Type
------------------

T1. Add a new COMPLETION_TYPE to the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module.

T2. COMPLETION_TYPE represents an abstraction for the completion status
    of one or more asynchronous collective operations.

T3. COMPLETION_TYPE is a derived type with private components. It is an
    extensible type with no type parameters. Each nonallocatable component
    is fully default-initialized.

T4. A scalar variable of type COMPLETION_TYPE is a completion variable.

T5. The value of a completion variable includes its completion count,
    which is a count of outstanding asynchronous collective operations
    associated with this variable.

T6. The initial value of the completion count of a completion variable
    is zero, representing that there are no outstanding asynchronous
    collective operations associated with this variable.

T7. A completion variable shall not appear in a variable definition context
    except as an allocate-object, or as an actual argument in a reference
    to a procedure with an explicit interface if the corresponding dummy
    argument has INTENT (INOUT).

T8. A variable with a nonpointer subobject of type COMPLETION_TYPE shall
    not appear in a variable definition context except as an
    allocate-object in an ALLOCATE statement without a SOURCE= specifier,
    as an allocate-object in a DEALLOCATE statement, or as an actual
    argument in a reference to a procedure with an explicit interface if
    the corresponding dummy argument has INTENT (INOUT).

3. Asynchronous Collective Initiation
-------------------------------------

C1. Add a new keyword argument COMPLETION= to each of the five existing
    collective subroutines: CO_BROADCAST, CO_MAX, CO_MIN, CO_REDUCE, CO_SUM

C2. COMPLETION is an optional INTENT(INOUT) argument.

C3. If the optional COMPLETION argument is absent, the collective
    subroutine retains unchanged semantics as specified in Fortran 2023.

C4. If the optional COMPLETION argument is provided, it shall be a
    completion variable of type COMPLETION_TYPE from the intrinsic module
    ISO_FORTRAN_ENV. It shall not be coindexed.

C5. When the optional COMPLETION argument is provided, the completion
    variable shall have its count incremented by one before return, and
    this variable becomes "associated" with the asynchronous collective
    operation. This subroutine call is termed the "initiation" of the
    asynchronous collective operation.

C6. Implementations are encouraged to return as quickly as possible from
    the initiation call, but are permitted to stall for processor-dependent
    reasons before returning from the initiation call.

C7. After initiation, the collective operation proceeds asynchronously
    towards completion.  After the collective operation finishes its
    computation with respect to the current image, the count of the
    completion variable is decremented by one by the implementation.
    This decrement occurs regardless of whether an error condition occurs.
    This decrement is permitted to occur before the initiation call
    returns. A completion variable decrement on one image does not imply
    that other images participating in the same collective operation have
    finished their computation.

C8. An asynchronous collective operation is considered "outstanding" on a
    given image during the period between initiation and when the
    completion count of the associated completion variable next reaches
    zero.

C9. While an asynchronous collective operation is outstanding, any
    variable provided as the A, STAT or ERRMSG argument to the initiation
    call shall not be referenced, appear in a variable definition context,
    become undefined, or have its pointer association status changed.

C10. A completion variable shall not become undefined while its completion
     count is non-zero.

C11. It is permitted for multiple outstanding asynchronous collective
    operations to become associated with the same completion variable.
    Implementations shall support association of up to no less than 128
    outstanding asynchronous collective operations with any given
    completion variable.


4. Completion Wait Statement
----------------------------

Illustrative syntax:  COMPLETION WAIT( completion-item )

W1. The completion-item provided to the COMPLETION WAIT statement shall
    be a variable with type COMPLETION_TYPE from the intrinsic module
    ISO_FORTRAN_ENV. It shall not be coindexed.

W2. When completion-item is scalar, execution of the COMPLETION WAIT
    statement results in the executing image waiting until after the count
    of the completion variable reaches zero.

W3. When completion-item is an array, execution of the COMPLETION WAIT
    statement results in the executing image waiting until after the count
    of every completion variable in the array reaches zero.

W4. A COMPLETION WAIT statement contains no specifiers other than the
    completion-item.

W5. COMPLETION WAIT is not an image control statement.

5. Completion Query Function
----------------------------

Illustrative syntax:
   logical :: l
   l = COMPLETION_QUERY( completion-variable )

Q1. The completion-variable argument to COMPLETION_QUERY shall be a
    completion variable of type COMPLETION_TYPE from the intrinsic module
    ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.  It is an INTENT(IN) argument. It shall not be
    coindexed.

Q2. completion_query is an elemental function.

Q3. The result of the COMPLETION_QUERY function has type default logical,
    and its value is true if and only if the count of the completion
    variable is zero.

Q4. A COMPLETION_QUERY function accepts no arguments other than the
    completion-variable.

6. Error Behavior
-----------------

E1. If an error condition occurs during the execution of a collective
    operation and no STAT variable was present during the initiation call,
    the implementation initiates error termination.

E2. If a STAT variable was present during the initiation of an asynchronous
    collective and no error condition occurs during the computation, the
    STAT variable is assigned a zero value as if by intrinsic assignment.
    This assignment occurs between initiation and the decrement of the
    associated completion variable.

E3. If an error condition occurs during the execution of an asynchronous
    collective operation and a STAT variable was present during the
    initiation call, the STAT variable is assigned a non-zero value as if
    by intrinsic assignment.  This assignment occurs between initiation and
    the decrement of the associated completion variable.

E4. If an error condition occurs during the execution of an asynchronous
    collective operation and an ERRMSG variable was present during the
    initiation call, the ERRMSG variable is assigned an explanatory error
    message as if by intrinsic assignment.  This assignment occurs between
    initiation and the decrement of the associated completion variable.
