Discussion

We need to alter the wording of the final paragraph of 8.1.6 [183:14-18]. 
The statements executed during the execution of a critical construct form a
segment. We need to say that if image T is the next to execute the construct
after image M, the segment on image M precedes the segment on image T. The
present wording leaves each such segment unordered with respect to any
segment on another image.

The first sentence of the paragraph does not need rewording, but is included
in the edit to make it easy to understand the new wording of the rest. 



Edit to J3/07-007

[183:14-18] In 8.1.6 CRITICAL construct, replace the final paragraph by

The processor shall ensure that once an image has commenced executing
<block>, no other image shall commence executing it until the image has
completed executing it.  No image control statement shall be executed during
the execution of <block>. The sequence of executed statements is therefore a
segment (8.5.1). If image T is the next to execute the construct after image
M, the segment on image M precedes the segment on image T.
