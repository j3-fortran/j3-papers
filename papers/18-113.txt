For consideration.

Basic Functionality
===================

Provide a facility to define new types, not type aliases, from existing
types.

Rationale
=========

New types can be used for every purpose for which type aliases are
desired, but there are many things a new type can do that a type alias
cannot.

Here's one example where a new type solves a problem and a type alias
doesn't.  Suppose you have the requirement to evaluate something using,
say, rational approximations, and in some cases you need six digits of
precision while in other cases you need twelve.  Assume the twelve-digit
case is sufficiently more expensive that you want to use the six-digit
version where possible.  With two routines, you use SELECTED_REAL_KIND
to declare their characteristics, and glue them together with a generic
name.  You develop and certify them on a 32-bit machine.  Then you send
your whole program off to production and they can't even compile it
because they use a 64-bit machine where SELECTED_REAL_KIND(6) and
SELECTED_REAL_KIND(12) have the same value.

Estimated Impact on Standard
============================

Minor.

Detailed Specification
======================

Provide syntax to define a new type in terms of an existing one. 
Objects of the type from which new types are created are compatible with
objects of those new types, provided corresponding type parameters have
the same values.  New types inherit operations and type-bound procedures
from the type from which they are created.  Compatibility and
inheritance are already well-described concepts that can be exploited to
simplify description of new type definitions.

Type parameter values for the original type may be specified during the
definition of a new type.  Objects of the new type have those type
parameter values, which cannot be specified during declaration of
objects of the new type.  If values are not specified for type
parameters of the original type, values for those parameters shall be
specified during declarations of objects of the new types.

An already-existing example is the type DOUBLE PRECISION.  Objects of
that type have the same kind type parameter value as objects of type
REAL(kind(0.0d0)), and a kind type parameter value cannot be specified
during declaration of objects of type DOUBLE PRECISION.

Concrete syntax can be decided in due course.

Example:

  type, new :: Real6 => Real(selected_real_kind(6))
  type, new :: Real12 => Real(selected_real_kind(12))

or

  new type :: Real6 => Real(selected_real_kind(6))
  new type :: Real12 => Real(selected_real_kind(12))

wherein the blank in "new type" is optional.

Types Real6 and Real12 are distinct types, even if their type parameter
values are the same.  Therefore generic interfaces continue to work,
even if SELECTED_REAL_KIND(6) and SELECTED_REAL_KIND(12) have the same
value.
