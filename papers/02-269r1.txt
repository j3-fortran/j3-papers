In response to the discussion about the "or portion thereof"
text on 02-007r2.

[203:10-11], JOR offers the following clarifying edits:

203:9-11  Replace "the processor ... procedure." with
"the *dtv* dummy argument is argument associated with the effective
list item that caused the user-defined derived-type input procedure
to be invoked, as if the effective list item were an actual argument
in this procedure reference (2.5.6)."


Note to Editor: these next two edits refer to lines that are moved by
paper 02-219r2.  These two edits refer to the 02-007r2.

201:26    Replace "(OUT)" with "(INOUT)"

201:41    Replace "(OUT)" with "(INOUT)"
