From: Richard Bleikamp & JOR
Subject: SPLIT intrinsic rework
Date: 2021-February-25

Reference: 21-007, 21-109

This r2 paper adds edits to make TOKENIZE() and SPLIT() PURE and
SIMPLE, and update the relevant tables, etc.  Also, the straw
vote has been removed, and both batches of edits have been
combined into one set of edits.
- - - - -
Milan Curcic proposed separating the 3rd form of the new SPLIT
intinisic from the other forms, and either just keeping the 2 forms
of SPLIT that tokenize the whole string all at once, or making the
3rd form of SPLIT, the serialized form, a new intrinsic.

JOR also notes that the names "TOKENIZE" and "SPLIT" can be changed
to something more appropriate, but JOR has no objections to these
names.

Note that a straw vote at meeting #223 (19-0-3-2) was in favor
of renaming the first two forms of the old SPLIT as TOKENIZE, and
keeping the 3rd (serialized) form as SPLIT.  The edits below do that.

Note that Bill's suggested edits for the original SPLIT, to prohibit
coarrays and coindexed objects as arguments, is included (cut and
pasted verbatim from 21-109, except substituting TOKENIZE for SPLIT).
Bill's changes only affected the first two forms of the old SPLIT
intrinsic, not the 3rd serialized form.

Edits to 21-007

[xiii, 2] under Intrinsic procedures and modules:
    Change "SPLIT" to "TOKENIZE" in the list of new intrinsics.

[xiii, 2] under Intrinsic procedures and modules:
    Add this sentence just before the description of the new TOKENIZE.
    "The intrinsic subroutine SPLIT parses a string into tokens,
     one at time."

[338:17]
  Immediately before "and the elemental subroutine MVBITS,"
  Insert "the subroutine SPLIT, the subroutine TOKENIZE, "

[343:18+] add a new entry
    "SS indicates that the procedure is a simple subroutine."

[348, before line 1]
  In table 16.1, "Standard generic intrinsic procedure summary"

    Delete the 3rd form of SPLIT, and the word "or" at the end of the
    preceding line AND
    Rename SPLIT as TOKENIZE, and place the entry for TOKENIZE after
    the entry for TINY. Make its "class" "SS".  Renumber as
    appropriate (16.9.xxx)

[348, 1-] in table 16.1, "Standard generic intrinsic procedure summary"
    Add an entry for SPLIT after the entry for SPACING
    "SPLIT (STRING, SET, POS [, BACK])" with class "SS" and a
    description of "Parse a string into tokens, one at a time."

[432:23] Delete the 3rd form of SPLIT (renamed TOKENSIZE above), and
    delete the word "or" from the preceding line (line number may vary
    after reordering in the edit above for [348, before line 1]).

[432:25] Change "Class. Subroutine." to "Class. Simple subroutine."

[432:33-34] In 16.9.194 SPLIT (renamed TOKENIZE above), in the
  description of the TOKENS argument change the second sentence:

  "It is an INTENT(OUT) argument."

to

  "It is an INTENT(OUT) argument. The corresponding actual argument
  shall not be a coarray or a coindexed object."


[433:4-5] In 16.9.194 SPLIT (renamed TOKENIZE above), in the
  description of the SEPARATOR argument change the second sentence:

  "It is an INTENT(OUT) argument."

to

  "It is an INTENT(OUT) argument. The corresponding actual argument
  shall not be a coarray or a coindexed object."

[433:9] In 16.9.194 SPLIT (renamed TOKENIZE above), in the
  description of the FIRST argument change the second sentence:

  "It is an INTENT(OUT) argument."

to

  "It is an INTENT(OUT) argument. The corresponding actual argument
  shall not be a coarray or a coindexed object."

[433:15] In 16.9.194 SPLIT (renamed TOKENIZE above), in the
  description of the LAST argument change the second sentence:

  "It is an INTENT(OUT) argument."

to

  "It is an INTENT(OUT) argument. The corresponding actual argument
  shall not be a coarray or a coindexed object."

[433:20-36]  Delete all the descriptions for POS and BACK.  They
             are added back to the new SPLIT by the edits
             to [432:22+] below.

[434:3-19] Delete the example thats uses a DO loop.  They are added
           back to the new SPLIT by the edits to [432:22+] below.


[432:22+] After the entry for SPACING, add a new entry
          (note, all the added text below is identical to what was
           in 21-007, for SPLIT, but just those parts that apply to
           the 3rd/serialized form, EXCEPT that the Description has
           been reworded)

    "16.9.xxx SPLIT (STRING, SET, POS [, BACK])

     Description. Parse a string into tokens, one at a time.

     Class. Simple Subroutine.

     Arguments.

     STRING shall be a scalar of type character. It is an INTENT (IN)
     argument.

     SET shall be a scalar of type character with the same kind type
     parameter as STRING. It is an INTENT (IN) argument. Each
     character in SET is a token delimiter. A sequence of zero or more
     characters in STRING delimited by any token delimiter, or the
     beginning or end of STRING, comprise a token. Thus, two
     consecutive token delimiters in STRING, or a token delimiter in
     the first or last character of STRING, indicate a token with zero
     length.

     POS shall be an integer scalar. It is an INTENT (INOUT) argument.
     The value of POS shall be in the range
     0 < POS <= LEN (STRING) + 1.

     If BACK is absent or is present with the value false, POS is
     assigned the position of the leftmost token delimiter in STRING
     whose position is greater than POS, or if there is no such
     character, it is assigned a value one greater than the length of
     STRING.

     If BACK is present with the value true, POS is assigned the
     position of the rightmost token delimiter in STRING whose
     position is less than POS, or if there is no such character, it
     is assigned the value zero.

     If SPLIT is invoked with a value for POS in the range
     1 <= POS <= LEN (STRING), and the value of STRING (POS:POS) is
     not equal to any character in SET, the token identified by SPLIT
     will not comprise a complete token as described in the
     description of the SET argument, but rather a partial token.

     BACK (optional) shall be a logical scalar. It is an INTENT (IN)
     argument.

    Example.

    Execution of
      CHARACTER (LEN=:), ALLOCATABLE :: INPUT
      CHARACTER (LEN=2) :: SET = ', '
      INTEGER P
      INPUT = "one,last example"
      P = 0
      DO
          IF (P > LEN (INPUT)) EXIT
          ISTART = P + 1
          CALL SPLIT (INPUT, SET, P)
          IEND = P - 1
          PRINT '(T7,A)', INPUT (ISTART:IEND)
      END DO

    will print
      one
      last
      example"
