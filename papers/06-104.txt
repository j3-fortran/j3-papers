Subject: Bug in generic type-bound procedure example
Date:    2005 December 7

There must not be any working Fortran 2003 compilers yet, because
the example showing off generic type-bound procedures in
C.1.7 will not compile cleanly!  Fix the syntax.

At [447:24] change

< PROCEDURE, PRIVATE :: rat_asgn_i, rat_plus_rat, rat_plus_i

to

> PROCEDURE, PRIVATE :: rat_asgn_i
> PROCEDURE, PRIVATE :: rat_plus_rat
> PROCEDURE, PRIVATE :: rat_plus_i
