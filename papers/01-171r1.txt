Subject:  I/O modes (issues 306, 305, and 30)

Unresolved issue 306 gripes about inconsistent and repetitive
discussions of I/O modes.  The intent has been clarified in the
expositions of other papers, but has not to date been accurately
reflected in the actual edits.

EDITS

{In addition the the cases above, there are undoubtedly other
uses of "rounding mode" that should be "io rounding mode".
Haven't had time to grep for them all and get into this paper.
Editor intends to find and replace them all.  Noted on the
floor that there are several on page 222.}

{Here's where we really say it once.}

168:36-42 Replace the para with a new section 9.4.1 (thus
renumbering the existing 9.4.x sections).  All references too
9.4.1 in the rest of this paper are to the new 9.4.1, not the old
one.

  "9.4.1 Connection modes

    A connection for formatted input/output has several
    changeable modes: the blank interpretation mode (10.7.6),
    delimiter mode (10.9.2, 10.10.2.1), sign mode (10.7.4),
    decimal edit mode (10.7.8), io rounding mode (10.7.7), pad mode
    (9.5.4.4.2), and scale factor (10.7.5).  A connection for
    unformatted input/output has no changeable modes.

    Values for the modes of a connection are established when the
    connection is initiated.  If the connection is initiated by
    an OPEN statement, the values are as specified, either
    explicitly or implicitly, by the OPEN statement.  If the
    connection is initiated other than by an OPEN statement (that
    is, if the file is an internal file or preconnected file) the
    values established are those that would be implied by an
    initial OPEN statement without the corresponding keywords.

    The scale factor cannot be explicitly specified in an OPEN
    statement; it is implicitly 0.

    The modes of a connection to an external file may be
    permanently changed by a subsequent OPEN statement that
    modifies the connection.

    The modes of a connection may be temporarily changed by a
    corresponding keyword specifier in a data transfer statement
    or by an edit descriptor.  Keyword specifiers take effect
    at the beginning of execution of the data transfer statement.
    Edit descriptors take effect when they are encountered in
    format processing.  When a data transfer statement terminates,
    the values for the modes are reset to the values in effect
    immediately before the data transfer statement was executed.

{Delete a redundant and poorly phrased text.  Poorly phrased because
it uses the term "initial modes" which we never did a good job of
defining.  We've goten rid of it now.  There are just current
modes.}

[170:4-5] Delete "The initial...executed."

{Some terminology consistency trivia.}

[170:9] "specifiers" -> "modes"

[170:17] "properties" -> "modes"

{This list is out of date.  Fix it in a way that will stay fixed.}
[170:22] "BLANK=...specifiers"
   -> "specifiers for changeable modes (9.4.1)"

[170:27-28] "BLANK=...specifiers" -> "specifiers for changeable modes"

[170:27] "value" -> "values"  {for number agreement}

{Make wording of OPEN statement specifiers consistent.  Say the
same things, using the same terminology and in the same order for
each of the specifiers that really do act the same.  It is really
quite impressive how different these sections were in various
trivial ways.  Also make them reference how changeable modes work
instead of repeating it in multiple inconsistent ways.  Get rid
of "initial" terminology.  Also fix miscellaneous inappropriate
phrasing; for example these specifiers aren't for files - they
are for connections.  And say modes have no effect instead of
"are ignored" in some cases.}

[172:34-37] replace "The BLANK=...NULL."

  The BLANK= specifier is permitted only for a connection for
  formatted input/output.  It specifies the current value of the
  blank interpretation mode (10.7.6, 9.5.1.11) for input for this
  connection.  This mode has no effect on output.  It is a
  changeable mode (9.4.1).  If this specifier is omitted in an
  OPEN statement that initiates a connection, the default value
  is NULL.

[173:11-15] replace "The DELIM=...during formatted input."

  The DELIM= specifier is permitted only for a connection for
  formatted input/output.  It specifies the current value of the
  delimiter mode (9.5.1.12) for list-directed (10.9.2) and
  namelist (10.10.2.1) output for the connection.  This mode has
  no effect on input.  It is a changeable mode (9.4.1).  If this
  specifier is omitted in an OPEN statement that initiates a
  connection, the default value is NONE.

[173:17-20] replace "The PAD=...during formatted output."

  The PAD= specifier is permitted only for a connection for
  formatted input/output.  It specifies the current value of the
  pad mode (9.5.4.4.2, 9.5.1.13) for input for this connection.
  This mode has no effect on output.  It is a changeable mode
  (9.4.1).  If this specifier is omitted in an OPEN statement
  that initiates a connection, the default value is YES.

[173:24-29] replace "The DECIMAL=...unchanged."

  The DECIMAL= specifier is permitted only for a connection for
  formatted input/output.  It specifies the current value of the
  decimal edit mode (10.7.8, 9.5.1.9) for this connection.  This
  is a changeable mode (9.4.1).  If this specifier is omitted in
  an OPEN statement that initiates a connection, the default
  value is POINT.

[173:36-42] replace "The ROUND=...unchanged."

  The ROUND= specifier is permitted only for a connection for
  formatted input/output.  It specifies the current value of the
  io rounding mode (10.7.7, 9.5.1.10) for this connection.  This is
  a changeable mode (9.4.1).  If this specifier is omitted in an
  OPEN statement that initiates a connection, the io rounding mode
  is processor dependent; it shall be one of the above modes.

[174:7-10] replace "The SIGN=...(10.7.4)."

  The SIGN= specifier is permitted only for a connection for
  formatted input/output.  It specifies the current value of the
  sign mode (10.7.4, 9.5.1.14) for this connection.  This is
  a changeable mode (9.4.1).  If this specifier is omitted in an
  OPEN statement that initiates a connection, the default value
  is PROCESSOR_DEFINED.

{I assume the last sentence above is the intent.  I couldn't find
anything that actually said it.}

{Similarly fix data transfer statements.  These were just plain
wrong before.}

[179:39-44] replace "The DECIMAL=...no DECIMAL= specifier."

  The DECIMAL= specifier temporarily changes (9.4.1) the decimal
  edit mode (10.7.8, 9.4.4.11) for the connection.  If the specifier
  is omitted, the mode is not changed.

[180:2-7] replace "The values...no ROUND= specifier."

  The ROUND= specifier temporarily changes (9.4.1) the io rounding
  mode (10.7.7, 9.4.4.13) for the connection.  If the specifier
  is omitted, the mode is not changed.

[180:9-14] replace "The BLANK=...formatted input."

  The BLANK= specifier temporarily changes (9.4.1) the blank
  interpretation mode (10.7.6, 9.4.4.6) for the connection.  If
  the specifier is omitted, the mode is not changed.

[180:16-21] replace "The DELIM=...formatted output."

  The DELIM= specifier temporarily changes (9.4.1) the delimiter
  mode (10.9.2, 10.10.2.1, 9.4.4.9) for the connection.  If the
  specifier is omitted, the mode is not changed.

[180:23-28] replace "The PAD=...formatted input."

  The PAD= specifier temporarily changes (9.4.1) the pad
  mode (9.5.4.4.2, 9.4.4.10) for the connection.  If the
  specifier is omitted, the mode is not changed.

[180:30-36] replace "The SIGN=...formatted input."

  The SIGN= specifier temporarily changes (9.4.1) the sign
  mode (10.7.4, 9.4.4.14) for the connection.  If the
  specifier is omitted, the mode is not changed.

[181:1-17] Delete issue 306.

[192:45-193:5] Delete.  {Now covered by 9.4.1 in a way independent
of dtio.  The dtio procedure doesn't need to worry about resetting
this stuff because it is reset after each child data transfer
statement...or indeed after any data transfer statement at all.}

{Will likely later end up deleting note 9.45 also, but that's
in a separate paper.}

{Similarly fix up stuff in 10.7.  Including a bunch of
previously uncaught typos.}

[221:1-8] replace "may...restored to the procesor."

  temporarily change (9.4.1) the sign mode (9.4.4.14,9.5.1.14)
  for the connection.   The edit descriptors SS, SP, and S set
  the sign mode corresponding to the SIGN= specifier values
  SUPPRESS, PLUS, and PROCESSOR_DEFINED, respectively.

  The sign mode controls optional plus characters in numeric
  output fields.  When the sign mode is PLUS, the processor
  shall produce a plus in any position that normally contains
  an optional plus.  When the sign mode is SUPPRESS, the processor
  shall not produce a plus in such positions.  When the sign
  mode is PROCESSOR_DEFINED, the processor has the option of
  producing a plus or not in such positions, subject to
  10.6.1(5).

[221:13-20] replace these lines (including the superfluous 10.7.5.1
section header and the note that we don't bother with for any
of the other modes - plus the note is obvious with the new
phrasing) with

  The <k>P edit descritor temporarily changes (9.4.1) the
  scale factor for the connection to <k>.  The scale factor
  affects the editing of F, E, EN, ES, D, and G edit decriptors
  for numeric quantities.

[221:40-45] replace "may...are ignored."

  temporarily change (9.4.1) the blank interpretation mode
  (9.4.4.6, 9.5.1.11) for the connection.  The edit descriptors
  BN and BZ set the blank interpretation mode corresponding to
  the BLANK= specifier values NULL and ZERO, respectively.

  The blank interpretation mode controls the interpretation of
  nonleading blanks in numeric input fields.  Such blank
  characters are interpreted as zeros when the blank
  interpretation mode has the value ZERO; they are ignored when
  the blank interpretation mode has the value NULL.

[221:2-5] Delete "If a BZ...ZERO."

[221:6] "BN and BZ edit descriptors affect"
     -> "blank interpretation mode affects"
[221:7] "They have" -> "It has"

[222:9-10] replace "may..9.5.1.10." and the following para break with.

  temporarily change (9.4.1) the io rounding mode (9.4.4.13,
  9.5.1.10) for the connection.

[222:13-15] replace "This...only"
  "The io rounding mode affects the conversion of real and complex
  values in formatted input/output.  It affects only"

[223:20-26] replace "may...only"

  "temporarily change (9.4.1) the decimal edit mode (9.4.4.11,
  9.5.1.9) for the connection.  The edit descriptors DC and DP
  set the decimal edit mode corresponding to the DECIMAL=
  specifier values COMMA and POINT, respectively.

  The decimal edit mode controls the representation of the
  decimal symbol (10.5) during conversion of real and
  complex values in formatted input/output.  The decimal edit
  mode affects only"

{Annex C fixes}
{This is a substitute for the parts of paper 01-108r2 other
than the edits to table c.1}.

[169:1-6] Delete the J3 note.

[437:36-46] Delete.  This doesn't really add anything to what is
said better in the normative text.

[437:19] After "properties" insert ", among others,"
{Ok, it's a quick fix, but it works.  Note that even paper 108r2
doesn't add most of them - just the changeable modes.}

[220:33-42] Delete issue 30
