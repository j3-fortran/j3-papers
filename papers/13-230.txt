Title: BEQ, BNE instrinsic functions

Submitted by: Van Snyder

Status: For consideration

Basic functionality: Add intrinsic functions to test for equality and
inequality of bit strings.

Rationale: Testing for equality of bit strings (I,J) requires one of
the following:

  if ( BLE(I,J) .and. BLE(J,I) ) ....
  if ( POPCNT(IEOR(I,J)) == 0 ) ....
  if ( I == J ) ....

The first two are cryptic and increase long-term cost for developers,
and for processor implementors if they optimize.  They are inefficient
unless the processor recognizes the idiom.

The third is required by 4.4.2.2p1 to fail on ones-complement or
sign-magnitude platforms if I == +0 and J == -0.

Estimated impact: Minor

Markham M6 conformance: Remove simple deficiency and discrepancy.

Detailed specification: Add intrinsic functions to test for equality and
inequality of bit strings.

Draft edits: To estimate scope of project

Insert subclause 13.7.21a after 13.7.21:

<<13.7.21a BLE (I, J)>>

Description. Bitwise equality.

Class. Elemental function.

Arguments.

I        shall be of type integer or a <boz-literal-constant>.
J        shall be of type integer or a <boz-literal-constant>.

Result Characteristics.  Default logical.

Result Value.  The result is true if each bit of I has the same value
as the corresponding bit of J; otherwise the result is false.

The interpretation of a <boz-literal-constant> as a sequence of bits is
described in 4.7.  The interpretation of an integer value as a sequence
of bits is described in 13.3.

Example.  BLE ( B"1100", B"1100" ) has the value true.  BLE ( B"1010",
B"1100") has the value false.

Insert subclause 13.7.32a after 13.7.32:

<<13.7.32a BNE (I, J)>>

Description. Bitwise inequality.

Class. Elemental function.

Arguments.

I        shall be of type integer or a <boz-literal-constant>.
J        shall be of type integer or a <boz-literal-constant>.

Result Characteristics.  Default logical.

Result Value.  The result is true if any bit of I has a different value
from the corresponding bit of J; otherwise the result is false.

The interpretation of a <boz-literal-constant> as a sequence of bits is
described in 4.7.  The interpretation of an integer value as a sequence
of bits is described in 13.3.

Example.  BNE ( B"1010", B"1100") has the value true.  BNE ( B"1100",
B"1100" ) has the value false.
