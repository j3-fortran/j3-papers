Subject:     Draft answers to paper 309 INQUIRE by unit interp
Date: 2007 October 26

Paper 309 asserts that the results of an INQUIRE by unit are not
defined by the standard for some specifiers if there is no file
connected to the unit.  The list below is the specifiers and the
proposed result for an unconnected inquire by unit.  If these
results are correct, then for each specifier /INTERP will need
to craft sentences of the form "In an INQUIRE by unit where there
is no file connected, the result is ...."  The exact form will
vary with each specifier.  there seems little point in working out
the exact wording until we agree that it is necessary and that
the proposed answer is correct.  For what it's worth, different
compilers give different answers for some of the specifiers.

                        Proposed result for
Specifier               inquire by unit with
                        no file connected
