Discussion
----------

In interp F18/040 in N2205 the sentence
"If the coarray is an ultimate component of a dummy argument, the
ultimate arguments on those images shall be declared with the same name
in the same scoping unit and if in a recursive procedure at the same
depth of recursion."
was passed for 9.7.1.2 Execution of an ALLOCATE statement. The words
"and if in a recursive procedure at the same depth of recursion" at the
end of the sentence were not included in N2203 (Corrigendum 2) or the DIS
because something cannot be declared at a depth of recursion. However, in
the case of unsaved local variable of a recursive procedure, the depth of
recursion should be taken into account. An edit for the DIS is suggested.


Edit to the DIS
----------------

In 9.7.1.2 Execution of an ALLOCATE statement, para 4, at the end of the
sentence
"If the coarray is an ultimate component of a dummy argument, the
ultimate arguments on those images shall be declared with the same name
in the same scoping unit."
add
"; if the ultimate argument is an unsaved local variable of a recursive
procedure, the execution of the ALLOCATE statement shall be at the same
depth of recursion of that procedure on every active image in the
current team".
