                      TUTORIAL ON ASYNCHRONOUS  I/O
         
                   GETTING ASYNC I/O TO WORK PROPERLY
         
         Simple example:
         
         OPEN (unit=u, .."ASYNC")
         
         READ (u, wait="NO", handle=ha,  errs=100), A
         
           WAIT (u, handle=ha,  errs=100)
         
           compute using  A
         
           READ (u, wait="NO", handle=ha,  errs=100), A
         
         
         100   deal with eof, errors
         
         Note:  
          - "handle" is probably an integer tag, defined by library
          -  also provide inquiry capability to see if wait would occur
         
           INQUIRE (u, handle=ha, would_wait=ans)
         
         --------------------------------------------------------

         Example with two buffers  (unrolled)
         
           OPEN (unit=u, .."ASYNC")
         
           READ (u, wait="NO", handle=ha,  errs=100), A
         -
               READ (u, wait="NO", handle=hb,  errs=100), B
           WAIT (u, handle=ha,  errs=100)
           compute using  A
           READ (u, wait="NO", handle=ha,  errs=100), A
               WAIT (u, handle=HB,  errs=100)
               compute using  B
               READ (u, wait="NO", handle=hb,  errs=100), B
           WAIT (u, handle=ha,  errs=100)
           compute using  A
         
         
         100   deal with eof, errors

         SEMANTIC  ISSUES
         
         - Semantics must be correct with asynch operation
         
         - Processor allowed to perform the entire I/O 
         	operation entirely at either the READ (WRITE) or WAIT
         
         - State of data is nondeterministic between READ (WRITE) and WAIT
         
         - Processor allowed to copy data to an internal 
         	buffer immediately on WRITE; or not copy.
            ==> program MUST do one WAIT for each write
         	(if implementation copies, WAIT always fast)
         
         - Errors can be handled at either R/W or at WAIT
            --- but NOT in between (!)
         
         --------------------------------------------------------

         PROBLEMS:
         - in order to handle errors, the WAIT statement 
         	will need all the error-handling information of READ (WRITE)
           ==> statement form must allow it
           ==> user should provide same info to both
         
         - How does the optimizer know the boundaries for code motion?
           <<  There's no link between READ (WRITE) and associated WAIT >>
         
           possible solutions:
           -- worst-case assumption
           -- provide better information somehow
         	idea:  model after hardware "cache prefetch"

         Same example, with "PRE-READ" approach:
         
         
           OPEN (unit=u, .."ASYNC")
         
           READ (u, wait="NO", handle=ha,  errs=100), A
         >
               READ (u, wait="NO", handle=hb,  errs=100), B
           READ (u, wait="YES", handle=ha,  errs=100), A
           compute using  A
           READ (u, wait="NO", handle=ha,  errs=100), A
               READ (u, wait="YES", handle=hb,  errs=100),B
               compute using  B
               READ (u, wait="NO", handle=hb,  errs=100), B
           READ (u, wait="YES", handle=ha,  errs=100), A
           compute using  A
         
         100   deal with eof, errors
