Section 1 Edits
----------
249:7 [Misplaced constraint.  Don't worry about these if
02-107 passes, because it deletes abstract interfaces.  Otherwise,
editor: Delete C1211.]

And add a new constraint

244:25+ C1203.5(R1203)
If the \si{interface-stmt} is INTERFACE
PROCEDURE(), the \si{function-name} in the \si{function-stmt} or the
\si{subroutine-name} in the \si{subroutine-stmt} shall not be the same as
a keyword that specifies an intrinsic type.
-----------

245:1 [If procedure pointers aren't a problem, it's difficult
to imagine how internal procedures could be. However, they are
a problem if they are used in DTIO because an internal procedure
could be invoked out of context. Editor:
change
"."
to
", or an internal procedure if the generic-spec is not a dtio-generic-spec"
]
------------


This item was 
245:5 [PROCEDURE statements don't have generic identifiers. 
Note: this item was handled in 02-144 Item 6 ]
------------

251:1- [In lines 3-4 of Note 12.16, the term ``would have be''
is used.  This isn't used elsewhere (that I could find), and isn't
defined.  Editor: ``would have'' becomes ``must'' (yes ``must'' not
``shall'' because it's an ``inevitable consequence of provisions of this
standard'' -- or at least that's what the current note implies).]
------------

249:14+ [Editor: Delete ``section'' in Note 12.12.]
------------

267:2-3 [Editor: Set ``, or an asterisk'' in obsolescent
font.]
------------

273:1 [I changed ``\si{target}'' to ``\si{data-target} or
\si{proc-target}'' at meeting 159.  But the ``or \si{proc-target}'' part
is irrelevant -- we aren't later going to assign a value to a procedure
by way of a procedure pointer.  Editor: Delete it.]
------------

273:1+ [Missed a fine point of pointer components.  Does this
need an interp?]

Add a new item after item 2:

item 2.5: 
As the \si{expr} corresponding to a component with the
POINTER atttribute in a \si{structure-constructor}.
------------


274:3 [Editor: Put a \tdef around ``elemental
procedure''.  This will embolden it, and put it in the index.]

Section 2 Interop question

The answer to the question below is "Yes, it is OK." No edits
needed.

264:15-17,267:1-3 Is it OK for a DTIO procedure to have the
NAME= specifier?  If it's not OK, we need to say so about the procedure,
not the interface body -- because an interface block with a
\st{dtio-generic-spec} might contain a PROCEDURE statement that refers to
a module procedure, a dummy argument, a procedure pointer, an external
procedure having an interface specified by another PROCEDURE statement, or
(if the edit for 245:1 above is accepted) an internal procedure.
