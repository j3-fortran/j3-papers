1.0 Inquiry Functions

The referenced definition of ``transformational function'' depends on
the definition of ``elemental intrinsic function''. Can this be made
to work by deleting ``intrinsic'' and de-bolding the remaining
``elemental function'' at [291:11]?  Does the specification at
[291:8-11] that arguments of intrinsic inquiry functions need not have
defined values, need not be associated, and need not be allocated,
apply to inquiry functions in Section 14?  If so, we need to do
something at [269:20-24], because the inquiry functions in Section 14
aren't intrinsic.

Subgroup response:
The inquiry functions of Section 14 are intrinsic (see [371:16]), and
they are part of an intrinsic module. They have the characteristic
that the arguments are permitted to be unallocated allocatables or
pointers that are not associated. This is not in contradiction with
[269:20-24], that mentions that the actual arguments of non-intrinsic
inquiry functions cannot be unallocated allocatables or pointers that
are not associated. Subgroup however does not feel that there is
anything broken, and recommends not to take any action.

2.0 Purity of Subroutines

At [291:15-16] we found it necessary --- or at least desirable --- to
specify the purity of all intrinsic procedures.  At [371:16] it is
specified that the functions in Section 14 are pure, but the
subroutines aren't mentioned.  Should we add ``The elemental
subroutines are pure; the nonelemental subroutines are not.''? 

Subgroup response:
It is mentioned in [287:12], that 'An elemental subprogram is a pure
subprogram', thus the first proposed addition is already covered. The
second part of the sentence is expected not to be true, as we have
proposed in 04-288, that the non-elemental subroutines IEEE_SET_FLAG
and IEEE_SET_HALTING_MODE be made pure. Subgroup recommends that no
action be taken.

3.0 IEEE_VALUE

3.1 Description

The value of X is not used.  Its kind type parameter value is used for
generic resolution, and its shape is used for elemental-ness.  Is it
necessary to require that the value of X is defined?  If X is a scalar
pointer, is it necessary for it to be associated?  If X is an
allocatable scalar, is it necessary for it to be allocated?  Can we at
least add ``; its value need not be defined'' after ``real''?  Can we
add another sentence ``If it is a scalar pointer it need not be
associated; if it is an allocatable scalar it need not be
allocated.''?  We would also need to do something at [269:20-24],
because IEEE_Value is neither an inquiry function nor intrinsic.

Subgroup response:
The comments propose giving extra information, but not fixing anything
in the standard. As we would only add anything if the standard requires
fixing, subgroup recommends not to implement the proposal.

3.2 Note

On the most-widely used platform, if IEEE_Value is implemented as an
ordinary REAL function, it causes an exception when it is invoked with
its CLASS argument having the value IEEE_Signaling_NaN.  This makes it
next to useless.  If it is special-cased by the processor (yes, this
is more work), so that when it constitutes all of the expr in an
assignment-stmt, actual-arg or output-item it is implemented without
using the FPU, maybe it won't cause an exception --- and thereby
perhaps be useful.  Can we add a note to that effect, as follows ?

"IEEE_VALUE would be most useful if it were implemented in such a way
that invoking it does not cause an IEEE_INVALID exception in cases
where a reference to it constitutes the entire expr in an
assignment-stmt, actual-arg or output-item. "

Subgroup response:
The comments above propose to add an advice to implementors to the
text, and do not fix anything. Subgroup recommends not to implement
the proposal.

4.0 Inquiry Function

The definition of ``inquiry function'' is incorporated by reference
into Section 14.  Should it be incorporated here too?  If so, we need
to do something at [269:20-24], because the inquiry functions in
Section 15 aren't intrinsic.  Are all of the procedures in 15.1.2
pure?

Subgroup response:
The definition of 'inquiry function' is given in the glossary and in
13.1, and does not have to be repeated in section 14. The functions
C_ASSOCIATED, C_FUNLOC, and C_LOC are called 'inquiry functions'. The
inquiry functions are part of the intrinsic module ISO_C_BINDING, thus
subgroup feels that [269:20-24] is best left alone.

5.0 03-282

What became of 03-282?

Subgroup response:
This will become an interpretation request.
