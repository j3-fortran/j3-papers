Part 1: Interpretation Processing Rules
======================================================================

0. All interpretations are listed in J3 standing document 006.

1. Interpretations are processed by the J3/interp group and given a
   number.  The interpretation is marked "J3 consideration in
   progress".  An answer is formulated and presented to J3 in a
   meeting paper.

2. J3 votes on the answer at a J3 meeting; a simple majority vote
   marks the answer as "passed by J3 meeting".

3. Between J3 meetings the chair of /interp sends a J3 letter ballot
   to J3 to approve interp answers that have been "passed by J3
   meeting".  The letter ballot runs for 30 days.  Not voting on
   three of four consecutive J3 letter ballots is grounds to
   terminate J3 membership.  An interp answer passes by a 2/3rds
   vote; a no vote must be accompanied by an explanation of the
   changes necessary to change the member's vote to yes.

   J3/interp reserves the right to recall an interp answer for more
   study even if the answer passes.

4. The chair of J3/interp gathers all interp answers that are marked
   "passed by J3 letter ballot" and forwards them to the WG5
   convenor.  The WG5 convenor holds a ballot of individual members;
   a no vote must be accompanied by an explanation of the changes
   necessary to change the member's vote to yes.  The answers that
   pass this ballot become "WG5 approved".

   J3/interp reserves the right to recall an interp answer for more
   study even if the answer passes.

5. "WG5 approved" answers are processed into a corrigendum document
   by taking the edits from the interp answers and putting them in
   the format required by ISO.  A WG5 vote is made on forwarding the
   corrigendum to SC22.  Interps so forwarded are marked
   "Corrigendum".

6. J3/interp creates a edit for the next Fortran Standard if one is
   needed for all interps marked "Corrigendum".

NUMBER: F95/0031
TITLE: Association of pointer function result with INTENT(OUT) dummy
       argument
KEYWORDS: Pointer association, dummy argument association, intent
          attribute
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Subsumed by interp #74

QUESTION:  Consider the following program.

      PROGRAM P
        INTEGER, TARGET :: T

        CALL SUB(FPTR())
      CONTAINS
        FUNCTION FPTR()
          INTEGER, POINTER :: FPTR

          FPTR => T
        END FUNCTION FPTR
        SUBROUTINE SUB(IO)
          INTEGER, INTENT(OUT) :: IO

          IO = 17
        END SUBROUTINE SUB
      END PROGRAM P

According to 12.4.1 [200:30-32],

    "If a dummy argument is not a pointer and the corresponding
     actual argument is a pointer, the actual argument shall be
     currently associated with a target and the dummy argument
     becomes argument associated with that target."

According to 12.4.1 [201:19-21],

    "If a dummy argument has INTENT(OUT) or INTENT(INOUT), the actual
     argument shall be definable."

According to 5.1.2.3 [53:29-31],

    "The INTENT(OUT) attribute specifies that. . . any actual
     argument that becomes associated with such a dummy argument
     shall be definable."

The definition of "definable" supplied in Annex A (the term does not
appear to be defined in normative text) is:

    "A variable is <<definable>> if its value may be changed by the
     appearance of its <name> or <designator> on the left of an
     <assignment statement>."

According to this definition, "definable" is a property of variables
only.  In the example above, the actual argument is not a variable.
However, the actual argument is pointer associated with an object
that is definable.  The text cited from 5.1.2.3 refers to the
"actual argument that becomes associated with the dummy argument",
but the first piece of text cited from 12.4.1 makes it clear that
when the actual argument is a pointer, it is the target with which
it is associated that becomes argument associated with the dummy
argument, and not the actual argument itself.

Was it the intent of the committee that this program should not be
standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

The program does not conform to the standard.

    REAL,TARGET :: targ
    REAL,POINTER :: p
    p => targ
    PRINT *,ASSOCIATED(p,x)        ! statement 3
  END SUBROUTINE
END

Is this program standard-conforming, and if so, what value is
printed?

The real question is whether an expression argument that is a pointer
function reference is treated as a variable (data-object) argument
with the variable being the target of the pointer expression.  (Or
whether it is dereferenced as usual in the absence of POINTER dummy
arguments).

Re (statement 1), the question is whether VARIABLE is definable when
argument-associated with "F()".

Re (statement 2), if the previous answer was Yes (VARIABLE is
definable), then presumably it can be made INTENT(OUT).  A random
sample of 4 compilers revealed that they considered it not to be
definable.

Re (statement 3), the question is whether P is pointer-associated
with X, not pointer-associated with X, or processor-dependent.  Of
the same random sample 3 thought it was associated with X, 1 thought
not.

ANSWER:

1. The call to s1 is not standard conforming. 12.5.2.1 says:

'A dummy data object whose intent is not specified is subject to the
limitations of the data entity that is the associated actual
argument.  That is, a reference to the dummy data object may occur
if the actual argument is defined and the dummy data object may be
defined if the actual argument is definable.'

Here the actual argument is a function result, which is not
definable.  For example, it is not permitted on the left-hand side
of an assignment statement, since it is not a variable.  (Being
"defined" or "undefined" is fundamentally a concept that applies only
to variables.)

2. The call to s2 is not standard conforming. 12.4.1.1 says:

'If a dummy argument has INTENT(OUT) or INTENT(INOUT), the actual
argument shall be definable.'

Again the actual argument is a function result, which is not
definable.

3. The call to s3 is standard conforming and the pointer assignment
in s3 causes p and x to become associated. This may be deduced from
12.4.1.1, which says [200:38-42]:

'If the dummy argument has the TARGET attribute and is either scalar
or is an assumed-shape array, and the corresponding actual argument
has the TARGET attribute but is not an array section with a vector
subscript (1) Any pointers associated with the actual argument become
associated with the corresponding dummy argument on invocation of the
procedure ...'

TITLE: Are dummy functions returning assumed-length character legal?
KEYWORDS: DUMMY FUNCTION, ASSUMED-LENGTH CHARACTER
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Are dummy functions returning assumed-length character legal?

Consider the following program:

        character*5 f
        external f
          call ss3(f)
        end
        subroutine ss3(ff)
        character*(*) ff, a*10
        external ff
          a = ff()//'99999999'
          print *, '<', a, '>'
        end
        function f()
        character*(*) f
          f = '123'
        end

The issue is the call to the dummy function 'ff' in subroutine 'ss3'.
Some compilers issue an error message. Others print the result:

 <123  99999>

There appear to be two relevant, contradictory passages in the F95
standard. Refer to section 5.1.1.5. <> means italics, [] means
obsolescent font.

The third constraint says "A function name shall not be declared with
an asterisk <char-len-param-value> [unless it is the name of the
result of an external function or the name of a dummy function.]

Before note 5.6 on the next page, the third bullet says:
(3) [In an external function, the name of the function result may be
specified with a character length parameter value of *; in this case,
any scoping unit invoking the function shall declare the function
name with a character length parameter value other than * or access
such a definition by host or use association. When the function is
invoked, the length of the result variable in the function is assumed
from the value of this type parameter.]

According to the standard, the use in the example program is legal,
because 'ff' is the name of a dummy function. But it seems clear that
the standard intended that the length of the variable returned by
a character function be known at compile time; it is not known in the
case where the function is a dummy function.

TITLE: Expressions in <type-spec> of a FUNCTION statement
KEYWORDS: expression - specification, expression - initialization,
          FUNCTION statement, host association, use association
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

The syntax rule R1217 shows that the type and type parameters of a
function can be specified in the FUNCTION statement (12.5.2.2).

(a) If a <type-spec> appears in a FUNCTION statement, can the
initialization and specification expressions of that <type-spec>
involve names of entities that are declared within the function or
are accessible there by host or use association?

(b) Section 5.1 states:

      "The <specification-expr> (7.1.6.2) of a <type-param-value>
       (5.1.1.5) or an <array-spec> (5.1.2.4) may be a nonconstant
       expression provided the specification expression is in an
       interface body (12.3.2.1) or in the specification part of a
       subprogram."

As a FUNCTION statement is not part of the specification part of a
subprogram, this text in the standard appears to distinguish between
FUNCTION statements that are in interface blocks and ones that are
not. This text seems to prohibit such examples as:

         INTEGER I
          ...
         CONTAINS
           CHARACTER*(I+1) FUNCTION F()
              ...
              COMMON // I
              ...

where it can be confusing as to which I is being referenced in the
FUNCTION statement.  While host association does not apply to
interface bodies, for consistency should the text quoted from Section
5.1 have been "... is in the specification part of an interface body
(12.3.2.1) or in the specification part of a subprogram."?

(c) Section 7.1.6.1 states:

      "If an initialization expression includes a reference to an
       inquiry function for a type parameter or an array bound of an
       object specified in the same <specification-part>, the type
       parameter or array bound must be specified in a prior
       specification of the <specification-part>."

Was this text intended to apply to FUNCTION statements even though
they are not part of any <specification-part>, thus disallowing
fragments such as:

      INTEGER (KIND=KIND(X)) FUNCTION F()
        INTEGER(KIND=KIND(0)) X
        ...

Similar text appears in Section 7.1.6.2.

ANSWER:

(a) A specification expression in the <type-spec> of a FUNCTION
statement may involve names of entities that are declared within the
function or are accessible there by host or use association, but an
initialization expression in such a <type-spec> may only involve
names that are accessible by host or use association.

(b) No.  It was not the intent of the standard to distinguish between
the two types of FUNCTION statements cited.  As elaborated in the
discussion of part (a), the standard intended to allow the
<type-spec> expression of a FUNCTION statement to be a nonconstant
expression.  The sentence cited is corrected with a supplied edit.

(c) Yes, the text cited from 7.1.6.1 was intended to apply to
FUNCTION statements.  The sentence quoted and the corresponding
sentence in 7.1.6.2 are corrected with supplied edits.  The code
fragment is not standard conforming.

Discussion:

(a) An initialization expression is a constant expression with an
additional rule relating to exponentiation (7.1.6.1).  Since it is a
constant expression, the only names it can contain are the names of
named constants, structure constructors, intrinsic procedures, and
variables whose type parameters or bounds are inquired about.

    * Named constant

      Section 5.1.2.1 states:

       "A named constant must not be referenced in any ... context
        unless it has been defined in a prior PARAMETER statement or
        type declaration statement using the PARAMETER attribute, or
        made accessible by use association or host association."

      Since the FUNCTION statement is the first statement of the
      scoping unit, there can be no prior PARAMETER statement or type
      declaration statement using the PARAMETER attribute, so the
      first clause does not apply. A named constant can appear in a
      <type-spec> of a function statement if it is accessible within
      the function by host or use association.

    * Structure constructor

      Rule R502 shows that the only opportunities for expressions to
      appear in <type-spec>s are in a <kind-selector> or in a
      <char-selector>.  However, a structure constructor can not
      appear in a <kind-selector> because rule R505 shows that a
      <kind-selector> must be an integer expression.  Similarly, R506
      shows that any initialization expression in a <char-selector>
      must be type integer.  Therefore, a structure constructor can
      not appear in an initialization expression in the <type-spec>
      of a FUNCTION statement.

    * Intrinsic procedure

      The intrinsic procedure names or classes of intrinsic
      procedures that may appear in an initialization expression are
      given in 7.1.6.1.

    * Variables whose type parameters or bounds are inquired about

      The text from section 7.1.6.1 as cited in question (c) was
      intended to apply to initialization expressions in the
      <type-spec> of a FUNCTION statement.  With the correction
      supplied, this means that if a variable appears as the argument
      to an inquiry intrinsic in the <type-spec> of a FUNCTION
      statement, the function must be a module procedure or an
      internal procedure, and the variable must exist in (be
      accessible from) the host scoping unit.

Rule R502 defines <type-spec>.  The only opportunity for a
<type-spec> to contain a <specification-expr> is when the data type
is character (<type-param-value> may be a <specification-expr>).
Section 7.1.6.2 states that a specification expression is a
restricted expression that is scalar, of type integer, and each
operation must be intrinsic.  In addition, rule (2) of 7.1.6.2 states
that a primary of a specification expression can be a dummy argument
that has neither the OPTIONAL nor INTENT(OUT) attribute.  The
following code fragment demonstrates a use of such a dummy argument:

              CHARACTER*(N+1) FUNCTION S(N)
              INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: N

Rule (2) also states that the primary can be a subobject of such a
dummy argument.  Section 6.1.2 indicates that a structure component
must not be referenced or defined before the declaration of the
parent object.  Similar rules are needed to prevent a substring from
being referenced ahead of the declaration of its parent, and an array
element or array section from being referenced ahead of the
declaration of the array.  Edits are provided to supply these rules.
Since a subobject can not be referenced before its parent object is
declared and the FUNCTION statement is the first statement of the
subprogram, the parent's declaration could not have occurred.  Thus a
subobject must not be referenced in the <type-spec> on a FUNCTION
statement for objects declared within the function.

Rule (3) states that a primary can be a variable that is in a common
block.  The following code fragment demonstrates a use of such a
common block member:

              CHARACTER*(N+1) FUNCTION S()
              ...
              COMMON N

As in rule (2), rule (3) allows a subobject of such a variable but
for the same reasons as above, such a subobject designator can not
appear in the <type-spec> expression of a FUNCTION statement.

Rule (4) states that a primary may be a variable that is accessible
by use association or host association.  The following code fragments
demonstrate uses of such variables:

              PROGRAM MAIN
              INTEGER :: N = 21
              ...
              CONTAINS
                CHARACTER(LEN = 2*N) FUNCTION SS(K)    ! N is host
                ...                                    !  associated.
                END FUNCTION
              END PROGRAM

    and

              MODULE MOD
              INTEGER K
              DATA K /20/
              END MODULE

              CHARACTER*(K*2) FUNCTION CHECK(STR)      ! K is use
                                                       !  associated.
              USE MOD
              ...
              END FUNCTION

Rule (4) also states that the primary can be a subobject of such a
use or host associated variable.

A structure constructor can not appear in a FUNCTION <type-spec>
specification expression because the expression must be of type
integer and any operations (which might yield an integer value from
one or more structure constructors) must be intrinsic.

Other rules of 7.1.6.2 state which intrinsic procedure names or
classes of intrinsic procedures may appear in a specification
expression.

Section 7.1.6.2 also states:

        A variable in a specification expression must have its type
        and type parameters, if any, specified by a previous
        declaration in the same scoping unit, or by the implicit type
        rules currently in effect for the scoping unit, or by host or
        use association.

The discussion above regarding specification expressions has already
ruled out "previous declarations" so the first clause of the cited
sentence does not apply.  The other clauses apply equally to a
FUNCTION statement <type-spec> and to type declaration statements
inside the function.

(b) When the discussion for part (a) is applied to the code fragment
provided, it means that the 'I' referenced in the <type-spec> of the
FUNCTION statement is the common block member.

TITLE: Referencing deferred bindings
KEYWORDS: Type-bound procedure, deferred binding
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress - Edit subsumed by interp F03/0004

QUESTION:

I thought that the intent was that it would be
impossible to reference a deferred binding.  However, it
doesn't appear to me that this intent was achieved.
Consider the following program (Sorry, but I don't have
any compilers up to syntax-checking this).

  module defer

    type, abstract :: t
    contains
      procedure (sub), nopass, deferred :: deferred_proc
    end type t
    type, extends(t) :: t2
    contains
      procedure :: deferred_proc => sub2
    end type t2

  contains
    subroutine sub
      write (*,*) 'Hello.'
    end subroutine sub
    subroutine sub2
      write (*,*) 'Goodbye.'
    end subroutine sub2
  end module defer
  program p
   use defer
   class(t), pointer :: x

   nullify(x)
   call x%deferred_proc

  end program p

Is this a valid program?  If not, what restriction of the
standard does it violate?

Note that x%deferred_proc does not require the value of x (4.5.7)
and thus is not a reference to x (2.5.6).  Therefore, [83:23-24]
does not prohibit this.  Nor is it clear that there is an intent
to prohibit invocation of type-bound procedures for disassociated
pointer objects; except in the case of deferred bindings, this
seems well-defined and potentially useful.

Because x is disassociated, its dynamic type is the same
as its declared type, thus making the interpretation of
x%nondeferred_proc reasonably clear.

ANSWER:

No, this was not intended to be a valid program.
An edit is supplied to clarify this situation.

TITLE: Type-bound procedures and undefined association status
KEYWORDS: Type-bound procedure, dynamic type
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

It appears that the dynamic type is undefined for a pointer with
undefined association status.  This impacts type-bound
procedures. Consider the following program.

  module undefined

    type :: t
    contains
      procedure, nopass :: nondeferred_proc => sub
    end type t
    type, extends(t) :: t2
    contains
      procedure, nopass :: nondeferred_proc => sub2
    end type t2

  contains
    subroutine sub
      write (*,*) 'Hello.'
    end subroutine sub
    subroutine sub2
      write (*,*) 'Goodbye.'
    end subroutine sub2
  end module undefined

  program p
    use undefined
    class(t), pointer :: x
    call x%nondeferred_proc
  end program p

Is this a valid program?  If not, what restriction of the
standard does it violate?  If so, what does it print.

Note that x%nondeferred_proc does not require the value of x (4.5.7)
and thus is not a reference to x (2.5.6).  Therefore, [83:23-24]
does not prohibit this.

If x were disassociated, its dynamic type would be t and the
interpretation of this would be reasonably clear.

However, the standard does not appear to specify the dynamic type
of x when its association status is undefined.  Nor can I find
any prohibition that applies to this case.

ANSWER:

No, the program is not valid, because the standard does not establish
an interpretation of it.  An edit is supplied to clarify this.

Furthermore, the case with a disassociated pointer was not intended to
be valid.  An edit is supplied to correct this oversight.

DISCUSSION:

Access to object-bound procedures (a.k.a. procedure pointer
components) always require there to be an object.  Access to
type-bound procedures of an object was intended to require this too,
but the effect of the NOPASS attribute on this was overlooked.

QUESTION:

There appears to be no explicit requirement that the
<variable>s in R736 and R741 be scalar.  If data-pointer-object
and proc-component ref were data-refs, then C614 would prohibit
the <variable>s from being arrays.  However, although the syntax
looks like a special case of a data-ref, nothing appears to say
that R736 and R741 actually constitute data-refs.

The standard gives no interpretation as to what the meaning
would be in the case of an array.

Even when variable is a scalar, the standard does not appear to
define what the properties (such as type and shape) of a
data-pointer-object or proc-pointer-object are in the case where
the syntax has a "%".  All we have is a syntax with no
established meaning.

Q1. Is the <variable> in R736 or R741 allowed to be an array?

Q2. Is the interpretation of the forms in R736 and R741 the
    same as that of a data-ref?

ANSWER:

A1. No.  The standard provides no interpretation of what such
    a form would mean.  Therefore, by the first sentence of
    1.5, it is not standard-conforming.  Edits are provided to

NUMBER: F03/0012
TITLE:  Procedure pointers and the EXTERNAL attribute
KEYWORDS: Procedure pointers, EXTERNAL
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Is the following program unit standard conforming?

  SUBROUTINE SUB ( RPP )
    REAL, EXTERNAL, POINTER :: RPP
    EXTERNAL :: PP
    POINTER :: PP
    PROCEDURE(REAL), POINTER :: PPP => NULL()
  END SUBROUTINE SUB

The last sentence of "5.1.2.6 EXTERNAL attribute" appears to indicate
that it is allowed:

  "A procedure that has both the EXTERNAL and POINTER attributes is a
  procedure pointer."

That the title of subclause 12.2.1.2 is "Characteristics of dummy
procedures and dummy procedure pointers" suggests that it is allowed.
That subclause continues "... whether it is a pointer, ..." so it was
clearly envisioned that at least dummy procedures could have the
POINTER attribute.

C1216 [264:30] appears to require PPP to be allowed:

"C1216 (R1214) If => appears in <proc-decl>, the procedure entity
       shall have the pointer attribute."

On the other hand, A conspiracy of C512 [72:28-29]

"C512 (R501) If the POINTER attribute is specified, the ALLOCATABLE,
      TARGET, EXTERNAL, or INTRINSIC attribute shall not be
      specified."

the second sentence of subclause 5.1.2.6 [80:38-40]

  "This [EXTERNAL] attribute may also be specified by ... a
  <procedure-declaration-stmt>..."

the first paragraph of subclause 5.2 [85:15ff]

  "The combination of attributes that may be specified for a
   particular entity is subject to the same restrictions ...
   regardless of the method of specification.  This also applies to
   the PROCEDURE, EXTERNAL and INTRINSIC statements."

and the last sentence of the first paragraph of 12.3.2.3 [264:8]

  "It [the procedure declaration statement] specifies the EXTERNAL
  attribute...."

appears to completely wipe out procedure pointers (PPP because of the
first paragraph of 12.3.2.3).

C521 [73:6-7] and C568 [91:5] also appear to prohibit RPP and PP:

"C521 (R504) The <function-name> shall be the name of an external
      function, a function dummy procedure{, or a statement
      function}."

"C568 (R541) A <proc-entity-name> shall also be declared in a
      <procedure-declaration-stmt>."

But then the first paragraph after R1210 (defining the EXTERNAL
statement) [264:1] appears to allow RPP and PP:

  "Each <external-name> shall be the name of ... a procedure
   pointer...."

There is also a problem with protected procedure pointers.  C535
clearly envisions their existence:

"C535 (R501) The PROTECTED attribute is permitted only for a procedure
      pointer...."

while C536 prohibits their existence:

"C536 (R501) If the PROTECTED attribute is specified, the EXTERNAL ...
      attribute shall not be specified."

ANSWER:

The discussion of procedure pointers is indeed inconsistent.

The program unit is intended to be standard conforming.  It was an
oversight during the development of the procedure pointer facility
that the EXTERNAL attribute was not removed from C512, that
"procedure pointer" was not added to C521, that C535 and C536
contradict one another, and that an external statement and specifying
the EXTERNAL attribute in a type declaration statement were not
allowed in C568.  It is not helpful that the last sentence of the
first paragraph of subclause 5.2 refers to "PROCEDURE ... statements"
(which could be confused with the PROCEDURE statement in an interface
block) where it should refer to "procedure declaration ...
statements."

EDITS:

Delete ", EXTERNAL" from C512 [72:28].

Insert ", a procedure pointer" after "dummy procedure" in C521 [73:7].

Replace C536 [7:35-36]:

"C536 (R501) If the PROTECTED attribute is specified, the INTRINSIC or
      PARAMETER attribute shall not be specified.  If the PROTECTED
      and EXTERNAL attributes are specified, the POINTER attribute
      shall also be specified."

Replace the last sentence of the first paragraph of subclause 5.2
[86:1] by "This also applies to procedure declaration statements, and
to EXTERNAL and INTRINSIC statements."

Replace C568 [91:5]:

"C568 (R541) The EXTERNAL attribute (5.1.2.6) shall be explicitly
      specified for a <proc-entity-name>."

QUESTION 1:

Does the following program unit conform to the 2003 standard?

  contains
    integer function MyAdd ( A, B )
      type(t), intent(in) :: A
      real, intent(in) :: B
    end function MyAdd
  end module M

QUESTION 3:

If the interface block and type definition are exchanged in QUESTION
2, does the program unit conform to the 2003 standard?

ANALYSIS:

The OPERATOR(+) bindings to the types T and X construct a single
generic OPERATOR(+) interface that is a local entity of module M.
They do not construct separate OPERATOR(+) generic interfaces that
are separate local entities of the types.

16.2.3 (Restrictions on generic declarations) specifies that it
"contains the rules that shall be satisfied by every pair of specific
procedures that have the same generic identifier within a scoping
unit."

It is clear that if different functions with identical interfaces
were bound to the types that they would be a "pair of specific
procedures" and the resulting OPERATOR(+) interface would therefore
be prohibited by 16.2.3.

It is not clear whether the generic bindings bind separate specific
procedures to the OPERATOR(+) generic, or only redundantly bind the
same procedure.  If the former, the program units are not standard
conforming because they violate the provisions of 16.2.3.  If the
latter, they appear to be standard conforming.

C1209 (in 12.3.2.1) prohibits a procedure to be bound to a generic
interface more than once in a scoping unit, but only by way of a
PROCEDURE statement in a generic interface block.  There is nothing
obviously equivalent in 4.5.4, nor anything that specifies that C1209
applies to generic bindings to types.  It also does not apply between
a generic interface block and a generic interface previously
specified by a generic binding to a type (question 3), since the
latter specific binding is accomplished by a conspiracy of a
<proc-binding-stmt> and a <generic- binding>, not by a
<procedure-stmt>.

ANSWER:

The program units conform to the 2003 standard.  Multiple bindings of
the same procedure to a generic identifier using a <generic-binding>
in a type definition or by a type definition and a generic interface
block do not bind a "pair of specific procedures" to the generic
interface. Indeed, the following type definition is legal:

  type Z
  contains
    procedure :: MyAdd
    generic :: operator(+) => myAdd, operator(+) => myAdd
  end type Z

QUESTION 1:

Does the following program conform to the 2003 standard?

  program P
    interface X
      subroutine S ( A )
        integer :: A
      end subroutine S
      procedure S
    end interface X
  end program P

ANALYSIS:

16.2.3 (Restrictions on generic declarations) specifies that it
"contains the rules that shall be satisfied by every pair of specific
procedures that have the same generic identifier within a scoping
unit."

It is not clear whether the interface body and the procedure
statement bind separate specific procedures to the generic
identifier, or only redundantly bind the same procedure.  If the
former, the program is not standard conforming because it violates
the provisions of 16.2.3.  If the latter, it appears to be standard
conforming.

C1209 (in 12.3.2.1) prohibits a procedure to be bound to a generic
interface more than once in a scoping unit, but only by way of a
PROCEDURE statement in a generic interface block.

There is a general rule that nothing shall be declared more than
once. It appears that a procedure statement within an interface block
is not a declaration:  5.1.2.6 (External attribute) specifies that
the external attribute may be specified by an EXTERNAL statement, a
<procedure- declaration-stmt> or an interface body that is not in an
abstract interface block.  A procedure statement in an interface
block apparently does not specify the external attribute.  The
procedure specified by the PROCEDURE statement in the above example
is clearly an external procedure with an explicit interface, so it
satisfies the requirements of C1207.

ANSWER:

The program conforms to the 2003 standard.  Multiple bindings of the
same procedure to a generic identifier using an interface body and a
procedure statement do not bind a "pair of specific procedures" to
the generic interface.

Enforcing C1209 is more bother for processors than simply allowing
multiple bindings of a particular specific procedure to a generic
interface.  It is unhelpful to users, and can be hurtful if the
multiple bindings are specified by independent generic interfaces and
brought into a scoping unit by use association from different
modules.  There was no equivalent constraint in Fortran 90, although
something like it was added by interp F90/000007.  The constraint
added there applied only to a single specification part.  It's not
clear whether that meant "declared in the same specification part" or
"accessible in the same specification part."  When it was put into
Fortran 95, it clearly applied to all accessible generic interfaces
with a particular <generic-spec>.  Given the multitude of new ways to
bring specific procedures into a generic interface in Fortran 2003,
and that many of those ways allow a specific procedure to be bound to
a generic identifier more than once, this conspicuously lonely
constraint should be removed.  Edits are supplied to correct this
oversight.

TITLE: Kinds of intrinsic type parameters
KEYWORDS: type parameter, kind, intrinsic type
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Q1. What are the kinds of the type parameters for intrinsic types?

    In most contexts, it doesn't matter. Fortran 95 did not even
    have the concept of the kind of a type parameter or a context
    in which such a thing could be detected in a
    standard-conforming program.  Fortran 2003 added the concept
    in support of derived types. It also added a syntax which
    exposes the question for intrinsic types.

Q2. What is the KIND of a type parameter inquiry?

Q3. For example, consider the program

      program what_kind
        character c
        write (*,*) kind(c%kind) == kind(0)
        write (*,*) kind(c%len) == kind(0)
      end

    Are both write statements guaranteed to print .true. (meaning
    that the c%kind and c%len are of default kind) or not?

For KIND parameters, although I can't find it explicitly stated,
I see fairly strong evidence that all intrinsic kind parameters
are intended to be default integers.  This evidence is in the
intrinsic functions.  The KIND intrinsic function and all the
selected_*_kind functions are specified to return default
integers, which would make for some strangeness if the kind
parameters were not default integer, in particular if the KIND
intrinsic could not return the kind of its argument because that
kind could not be represented in a default integer.

There also seems no obvious benefit to having the kind of the
intrinsic kind parameters be anything other than default. In
practice, the number of supported values for kind is small and
would have no trouble being represented in a default integer;
large arrays of kind values are rare, so there isn't much
benefit in using representations smaller than default.

For character length, I see no similar evidence.  Indeed, the
LEN intrinsic seems to suggest that lengths might be other than
default integer. I believe that there was clear intent to
facilitate (but not require) support for character lengths
longer than could be expressed by a default integer.

In most contexts, it doesn't directly matter what the kind of
length is.  Parameter specifications in type-specs don't have to
match in kind. So the user could specify and do arithmetic on
lengths using whatever kind was appropriate for the anticipated
problem sizes. The limit on maximum character length is
processor-dependent anyway and is not necessarily the same
as HUGE(whatever) (though it is a bit hard to imagine how it
could usefully be larger).

The only context in which I can see that might matter is in a
type parameter inquiry (6.1.3).  We don't appear to have defined
the kind of a type parameter inquiry.  Although we didn't say, I
am assuming that a type parameter inquiry ought to "return" the
kind of the type parameter it is inquiring about. Otherwise,
there would be no way to inquire about the type parameter values
of some derived type variables (if the values didn't fit in a
default integer).  We probably ought to explicitly say, though.

ANSWER:

Q1. The kind parameters of all the intrinsic types are of
    default integer kind. The kind parameter of the intrinsic
    character length parameter is processor-dependent.

    The support for this answer is as described in the question.
    Edits are provided to make this answer explicit.

Q2. The kind parameter of a type inquiry is the same as that of
    the type parameter inquired about. See page 123, lines 35-36.

Q3. The first write statement is guaranteed to print a .true. value;
    it is processor dependent whether the second one prints a .true.
    or .false. value.

TITLE: Coexistence of IEEE and non-IEEE kinds

DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Is it allowed for a processor to have one or more real kinds for which
there is no IEEE support, while also having real kinds for which there
is IEEE support?

Much of the IEEE material appears to assume that a processor could
simultaneously support both IEEE and non-IEEE kinds.  I thought this
was the intent.  However, the first sentence of the second paragraph
in section 14 says that if IEEE_EXCEPTIONS or IEEE_ARITHMETIC is
accessible in a scoping unit, then IEEE_OVERFLOW and
IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO are supported in the scoping unit for *ALL*
[emphasis mine] kinds of real and complex data.  This says to me
that if there is any kind of real for which the processor cannot
support IEEE_OVERFLOW or IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO, then pretty much none
of the IEEE stuff can be used on that processor at all; there
isn't much of the IEEE stuff that can be used without IEEE_ARITHMETIC
or IEEE_EXCEPTIONS.  This seems draconian and unintended.

I speculate that this condition is intended to apply to all IEEE
real kinds rather than to all real kinds.

ANSWER:

Yes, this is allowed.

The requirement that IEEE_OVERFLOW and IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO be
supported for all kinds of real and complex data within that
scoping unit was intentional.

Support of these two flags means that the exceptions can be detected,
either by a subsequent use of IEEE_GET_FLAG or by program termination
(this is not under program control unless IEEE_SUPPORT_HALTING is true
for those flags).

Whether the flags are supported outside of a routine which uses
IEEE_EXCEPTIONS or IEEE_ARITHMETIC is processor dependent.

None.

There appears to be no restriction against arrays in these

what an array would mean.  The wording implies a scalar, in
that it talks about being true or false, but the restriction
to scalars is not explicit. For IEEE_GET_UNDERFLOW_MODE, it

ANSWER:

Yes, this is allowed, since "whole" means that b is
ASSOCIATED with all elements of an array that was ALLOCATEd.
In the given example, ASSOCIATED(a,b) is .TRUE., therefore either

STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

      PROGRAM foo
        CHARACTER, TARGET :: c
        CLASS(*), POINTER :: p

        p => c
        SELECT TYPE (p)
          TYPE IS (CHARACTER(*))
            PRINT *, 'Character of length ', LEN(p)
        END SELECT
      END

Constraint C814 says that, in a type guard statement, the <type-spec>
shall specify that each length type parameter is assumed.

Constraint C416 does not list a type guard statement as a context in
which "*" can be used as a length type parameter for a character.

Was this program intended to be standard-conforming?

Yes, this program was intended to be standard-conforming.  Edits are
supplied to correct this oversight.

TITLE: Commas in complex namelist output
KEYWORDS: Namelist, complex formatting, comma, semicolon
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

The 7th paragraph in 10.9.2 for list directed output says:

"Complex constants are enclosed in parentheses with a
separator between the real and imaginary parts, each
produced as defined above for real constants. The separator
is a comma if the decimal edit mode is POINT; it is a
semicolon if the decimal edit mode is COMMA."

There are similar words in most other places where complex
formatting is described.

The second paragraph of 10.10.1.3 Namelist group object list
items says:

"When the next effective item is of type complex, the input
form of the input value consists of a left parenthesis
followed by an ordered pair of numeric input fields
separated by a comma and followed by a right parenthesis. "

Other places correctly describe namelist complex output as
having a separator, either a comma or a semicolon, depending
on the decimal edit mode.

Should the namelist version be reworded to say "comma or
semicolon"?

ANSWER:

Yes.  Edits are supplied to correct this oversight.
In addition, a similar issue exists for list directed input of
undelimited character values and namelist output of character
values.

EDITS:

All edits refer to 04-007.

[240:13] Replace "comma" with "comma (if the decimal edit mode is
         POINT), semicolon (if the decimal edit mode is COMMA)"

           COMMA.
[244:32] Replace "comma" with "separator".

TITLE: Negative zero and intrinsic functions
KEYWORDS: Negative zero, IEEE, intrinsic functions
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

4.4.2 states
  "Processors that distinguish between positive and negative zeros
   shall treat them as equivalent ... as actual arguments to intrinsic
   procedures other than those for which it is explicitly specified
   that negative zero is distinguished"

Q1. Does this mean that TRANSFER(-0.0,42) is required to give the same
    answer as TRANSFER(+0.0,42)?  The definition of TRANSFER has no
    explicit mention of negative zero.

Q2. Does this mean that MERGE(+0.0,-0.0,flag) always returns +0.0?

Q3. Does this mean that SPREAD(-0.0,2) has the value [+0.0,+0.0]
    instead of [-0.0,-0.0]?

Q4. Does this mean that RESHAPE([-0.0],[1]) has the value [+0.0]
    instead of [-0.0]?

Q5. Does this mean that SET_EXPONENT(-0.0,10) is +0.0 not -0.0?

Q6. Does this mean that if a REAL variable X has a negative zero
    value, REAL(x,...) has a positive zero value?

Q7. Does this mean that CMPLX(0,-0.0) has the value (+0.0,+0.0)
    instead of (+0.0,-0.0)?

Q8. Does this mean that if a complex variable C has a negative zero
    imaginary part, that AIMAG(C) returns +0.0 instead of -0.0?

Q9. In any other intrinsic function, if the definition of the
    intrinsic would imply a different result for negative zero than
    for positive zero, does this mean that the function returns the
    positive zero answer for a negative zero argument?

ANSWER:

Q1.  No.  The definition of TRANSFER explicitly states that its result
     has the same physical representation as its first argument.  This
     would not be possible if "equivalent" meant that the exact same
     result had to be produced.

Q2.  No, this would contradict the definition of MERGE.

Q3.  No.  SPREAD "replicates" its argument, which means that the value
     of each copy is the same as the original, not just compare equal.
     As with TRANSFER, this would not be possible with the suggested
     interpretation of the text in 4.4.2.

Q4+.  No.  As with the previous questions, this would require an
      overly strict interpretation of the term "equivalent",
      contradicting the clear intent of the function in question.

DISCUSSION:

The term "equivalent" in the quoted text in 4.4.2 refers to the
concept of mathematical equivalence, not physical or computational
equivalence.  A clarifying edit is supplied.

EDITS:

[38:2] Before "equivalent" insert "mathematically".

TITLE:  IEEE divide by zero
KEYWORDS: IEEE-754, divide-by-zero
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Is infinity / 0.0 a divide by zero exception?
Is NaN / 0.0 a divide by zero exception?

Fortran 2003 defines (in 14.2) infinity / zero and NaN / zero
cases as IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO.  IEEE-754 defines (in 6.1 and 6.2)
those two as unexceptional.

ANSWER:

On an IEEE-conformant processor, these cases do not raise exceptions
(see clauses 6.1 and 6.2 of IEEE-754).

The definitions in 14.2 were intended to describe IEEE exceptions with
sufficient latitude to allow use on near-IEEE and non-IEEE machines.
However, the definition of IEEE_DIVIDE_BY_ZERO is not consistent with
the IEEE International Standard.

Furthermore, the definition of the IEEE_OVERFLOW flag is also not
consistent with the IEEE standard, because this exception is not
raised for operations on infinite operands.

Edits are provided to fix these inconsistencies.

logb() should be defined as if the hardware representation had

TITLE:  HYPOT()
KEYWORDS: IEEE-754, hypot()
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

What is HYPOT(NaN,infinity)? HYPOT(NaN,finite)?

HYPOT(X,Y) when X and/or Y is an infinity (even if the other is
a NaN) shall be +infinity.  Reason: hypot(), when one of the
arguments is an infinity, is +infinity independent of the
value of the other argument.  So, if the NaN argument is
replaced by zero, any finite number, or any infinity,
hypot(infinity,NaN) is still infinity.

HYPOT(X,Y) when X and/or Y is a NaN (and neither is infinite)
shall be a NaN, and should one of the NaN arguments.

ANSWER:

The HYPOT example in note 14.17 illustrates the use of the features
of this section to provide reliable software that is fast in the
uncomplicated case.  We did not consider what would happen if one
of the arguments is a NaN and have therefore edited the text slightly.

DISCUSSION:

In fact, if either X or Y is a NaN, the first executable statement
will set HYPOT to a NaN without signaling an exception. The slower
code in the IF construct will therefore not be executed and a NaN
will be returned, which is consistent with the way NaNs are handled
by intrinsic operators, see paragraph 3 of section 6.2 of the
IEEE International Standard.

13.7 [300:13-15] incorrectly requires an infinite result or a
NaN result to always signal some IEEE exception.

Consider changing [300:13] "infinite result" to "infinite result
(from finite arguments)".  Reason: IEEE-754 mathematical
operations on infinity that produce an infinity are
unexceptional.

Consider changing [300:14] "NaN result" to "NaN result (from
non-NaN arguments)".  Reason: IEEE-754 mathematical operations
on quiet NaN operands that produce a quiet NaN result are
unexceptional.

Consider adding to 13.7 [300:15+] something along the lines of:
"Unless specified otherwise, a math function with NaN
argument(s) shall return a NaN, which should be one of the NaN
arguments."  This allows not having to specify the results for
each specific math function.

Consider adding the above suggested cases to each of the 13.7.*
functions, perhaps, with a bold face IEEE sub-heading.

ANSWER:

The penultimate sentences of 13.7 was intended for the case
where all arguments on entry have normal or denormal values  
and edits are supplied to correct this. 

To specify the results of all the intrinsics for non-normal
values is beyond the scope of an interpretation. Perhaps this 
should be considered for an extension that is adopted for the 
next revision of the standard. Meanwhile, guidance is provided
by the second and third paragraphs of 14.8, which state

"The inquiry function IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN is provided to inquire 
whether the processor supports IEEE NaNs. Where these are supported, 
their behavior for unary and binary operations, including
those defined by intrinsic functions and by functions in intrinsic 
modules, shall be consistent with the specifications in the IEEE
International Standard.

The inquiry function IEEE_SUPPORT_INF is provided to inquire whether 
the processor supports IEEE infinities. Where these are supported, 
their behavior for unary and binary operations, including
those defined by intrinsic functions and by functions in intrinsic 
modules, shall be consistent with the specifications in the IEEE
International Standard. "

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

MODULE m

  END TYPE
CONTAINS
  ELEMENTAL SUBROUTINE finalizeT(f)
    TYPE(t), INTENT(INOUT) :: f

PROGRAM foo

  EXTERNAL xyz
  TYPE(t) :: a(10) = t(5)
  CALL xyz(a(2))
END PROGRAM

4.5.5.2 of Fortran 2003 states:
    When a procedure is invoked, a nonpointer, nonallocatable object
    that is an actual argument associated with an INTENT(OUT) dummy
    argument is finalized.

For assumed-size arguments, this situation is similar to that of
default initialization with INTENT(OUT).  Default initialization is
prohibited for INTENT(OUT), assumed-size dummy arguments by C544.  A
similar restriction on finalization may have been overlooked.

Was this program intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

No, this program was not intended to be standard-conforming.  An edit
is supplied to correct this oversight.

DISCUSSION:

The unstated philosophy of assumed-size arrays in the standard is that
no action is allowed on an assumed-size array which would need to be
applied elementally to the whole array.  That is why no whole array
assignment is allowed, for example.

In accordance with this philosophy,
(1) types with ultimate allocatable components also need to be
    excluded from being INTENT(OUT) assumed-size, as procedure
    invocation in this case requires deallocation of all the
    allocated components.

(2) polymorphic INTENT(OUT) assumed-size arrays should also be
    excluded, as they might have finalisation, default initialisation
    or allocatable components.

This interp subsumes Fortran 2003 interp #0060.

TITLE: Unlimited polymorphic pointers in common blocks

DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

      PROGRAM foo
        COMMON /blk1/ x
        CLASS(*), POINTER :: x
        CALL sub
      END PROGRAM

      SUBROUTINE sub
        COMMON /blk1/ x
        CLASS(*), POINTER :: x
      END SUBROUTINE

There appears to be nothing prohibiting an unlimited polymorphic
pointer from appearing in a common block, but the following appears in
Fortran 2003 at [100:10]:
    A data pointer shall be storage associated only with data pointers
    of the same type and rank.

And at [75:23-25]:
    An object declared with the CLASS(*) specifier is an unlimited
    polymorphic object.  An unlimited polymorphic entity is not
    declared to have a type.  It is not considered to have the same
    declared type as any other entity, including another unlimited
    polymorphic entity.

It appears that it is not standard conforming to have an unlimited
polymorphic pointer that is storage associated with anything else,
including another unlimited polymorphic pointer.  So, while it is
apparently standard-conforming to have an unlimited polymorphic
pointer in a common block, a common block with the same name cannot be
accessed in any other scoping unit.

This interpretation also seems to be supported by parts of section 16
of the standard.

At [416:7-24]:
    In a storage association context
    ...
      (8) A pointer occupies a single unspecified storage unit that is
          different from that of any nonpointer object and is
          different for each combination of type, type parameters, and
          rank.

At [417:12-13]:
    All scoping units that access named common blocks with the same
    name shall specify an identical sequence of storage units.

And at [417:14-17]:
    For any two blank common blocks, the initial sequence of storage
    units of the longer blank common block shall be identical to the
    sequence of storage units of the shorter common block.  If two
    blank common blocks are the same length, they shall have the same
    sequence of storage units.

Was it intended that an unlimited polymorphic pointer should be
allowed in a common block?  If yes, then was it intended that such a
common block should be accessible in more than one scoping unit?

ANSWER:

No.  An edit is provided to correct this oversight.

DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

The descriptions of the intrinsic procedures often use the term "type"
without qualification.  It is unclear whether they mean "declared
type" or "dynamic type".  If they mean "dynamic type", then this would
appear to allow unlimited polymorphic arguments to intrinsic
procedures like ABS and SIN.  Resolution of generic intrinsic
procedures in this case would create an undue (and likely unintended)
burden on the processor, and the declared type of the result of such a
function call would be unclear as well.

Question 1:
Are the arguments of the intrinsic functions ALLOCATED, ASSOCIATED,
LBOUND, SHAPE, SIZE, and UBOUND permitted to be polymorphic?

Question 2:
(a) Is the ARRAY argument of the intrinsic function CSHIFT permitted
    to be polymorphic?

    are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 3:
(a) Are the ARRAY and BOUNDARY arguments of the intrinsic function
    EOSHIFT permitted to be polymorphic?

    are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 4:
(a) Are the A and MOLD arguments of the intrinsic function
    EXTENDS_TYPE_OF permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on their types refer to their declared types
    or dynamic types?

Question 5:

    MERGE permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on the types of the arguments refer to their
    declared types or dynamic types?
(d) If either argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 6:
Are the FROM and TO arguments of the intrinsic function MOVE_ALLOC
permitted to be polymorphic?

Question 7:
(a) Are the ARRAY and VECTOR arguments of the intrinsic function PACK
    permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on the types of the arguments refer to their
    declared types or dynamic types?
(d) If either argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 8:
(a) Are the SOURCE and PAD arguments of the intrinsic function RESHAPE

    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 9:
(a) Are the A and B arguments of the intrinsic function SAME_TYPE_AS
    permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If one of these arguments is polymorphic, must the other be
    polymorphic?
(c) Do the requirements on their types refer to their declared types
    or dynamic types?

Question 10:
(a) Is the SOURCE argument of the intrinsic function SPREAD permitted
    to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If the argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?  What
    are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 11:
(a) Is the SOURCE argument of the intrinsic function TRANSFER
    permitted to be polymorphic?
(b) Is the MOLD argument of the intrinsic function TRANSFER permitted
    to be polymorphic?
If the answer to (b) is yes:
(c) If the MOLD argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?
    What are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

Question 12:
(a) Is the MATRIX argument of the intrinsic function TRANSPOSE
    permitted to be polymorphic?
If so:
(b) If the argument is polymorphic, is the result polymorphic?  What
    are the declared and dynamic types of the result?

  END TYPE

9.5.3.7.2 states:
  A record positioning edit descriptor, such as TL and TR, used on
  unit by a child data transfer statement shall not cause the record
  position to be positioned before the record position at the time the
  user-defined derived-type input/output procedure was invoked.

The term "record position" is used, but it doesn't appear to be
defined anywhere.  Depending on the interpretation, the above program
might be standard-conforming, or it might not be.

If "record position" is taken to mean "the position within the current
record", regardless of which record is the current record, then the
record position at the beginning of the UDDTIO procedure is before the
fourth character of the record.  The first child data transfer
statement begins a new record, and the second child data transfer
statement writes to the first character of the new record.  This would
be before the "record position" at the time the UDDTIO procedure was
invoked, and the program would not be standard-conforming.

If "record position" is taken to mean a combination of the record and
the position within that record (essentially making it mean the same
thing as "file position"), then the above program is standard-
conforming, since the control edit descriptor doesn't cause the file
to be positioned before the record position when the UDDTIO procedure
was invoked.

What is the meaning of "record position", and is the above program
standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

The term "record position" means the same as the term "file position".
The program is standard-conforming.

The PRINT statement prints

 xyz.3
AB

where the first record starts with a space and the "." represents 0 or
more spaces.

10.9.2 of Fortran 2003 states that character sequences produced for
list-directed output are not separated from each other by value
separators when the delimiter mode is NONE.  The implication of this
is obvious when the adjacent effective output list items are both of
character type.  But when user-defined derived-type input/output
is involved, it is much less clear whether a separator should be
included in the output.

In the example given, it is unclear whether the output should be:
 xyz 5 azyx
or:
 xyz 5 a zyx

1. Should a separator be inserted between two non-delimited character
   sequences when one of the character sequences is written by a child
   data transfer statement, and the other is written by a parent data
   transfer statement, where both statements are list-directed?

2. Should a separator be inserted between two non-delimited character
   sequences when the character sequences are written by two different
   child data transfer statements, where both statements are
   list-directed?

3. Should a separator be inserted between two character sequences when
   one of the character sequences is written by a child data transfer
   statement, and the other is written by a parent data transfer
   statement, where one of the statements is list-directed and the
   other is format-directed?

4. Should a separator be inserted between two character sequences when
   the character sequences are written by two different child data
   transfer statements, where one of the statements is list-directed
   and the other is format-directed?

ANSWER:

1) No. It is the intent of the standard that when both the parent
   and child data transfer statements are both list-directed
   output statements, or both are namelist output statements, the
   processor treats the first list item appearing in a child data
   transfer statement as if that list item had immediately
   followed the last list item processed by the parent data
   transfer statement, as long as no other data transfers to that
   unit occurred in between the processing of those two list items.
   Therefore, in this case, the two character sequences are
   considered adjacent.

2) No. It is the intent of the standard that when two different
   child data transfer statements are both list-directed output
   statements, or both namelist output statements, they write to the
   same unit, and no other data transfers to that unit occur
   in between the two child data transfer statements, the processor
   treats the first list item appearing in the second child data
   transfer statement as if that list item had immediately followed
   the last list item processed by the first child data transfer
   statement.  Therefore, in this case, the two character sequences
   are considered adjacent.

3) It is processor dependent whether or not a separator appears
   between two such character sequences.  In section 10.9.2, the
   phrase "adjacent undelimited character sequences" refers to
   character sequences produced by list directed output.  When one of
   the sequences is written by a child or parent output statement
   that is not list directed, the exception described in the first
   paragraph of 10.9.2 does not apply. The other rules for inserting
   optional blanks around values in list directed output allow the
   processor to insert optional leading and trailing blanks around a
   list item.  The standard does not specify when optional blanks are
   written; therefore, when two adjacent list items (the values
   thereof) are written to an output record, and only one of them was
   written by list directed I/O, the standard does not specify
   whether or not any optional blanks appear between those values in
   the output record.

4) It is processor dependent whether or not a separator appears
   between two such character sequences.  See answer 3.

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

MODULE m

  TYPE t
    INTEGER :: i
    INTEGER :: j
  END TYPE

  INTEGER :: ipos

  INTERFACE READ(FORMATTED)
    MODULE PROCEDURE formattedReadT
  END INTERFACE

CONTAINS

  SUBROUTINE formattedReadT (dtv, unit, iotype, vlist, iostat, iomsg)
    CLASS(T), INTENT(INOUT) :: dtv
    INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: unit
    CHARACTER(*), INTENT(IN) :: iotype

  WRITE(10, '(A)') '2*3 5'
  REWIND(10)
  READ(10, *) a
  PRINT *, a%i, a%j, ipos
END PROGRAM

10.9 of Fortran 2003 states that the r*c form of list-directed input
is equivalent to r occurrences of c.  So, when the read is performed,
it is as if the input record contains two occurrences of the number 3.

The first child read statement reads the first 3, and does not advance
the file position to the next record (because it is a child data
transfer statement).  It appears that the second read statement should
read the second 3.  But the file position between the child read
statements is unclear.

What does the above program print?

ANSWER:

The standard does not specify the behavior of a processor when a list
directed input record contains a r*c constant, and that entire set
of input values is not completely consumed by one list directed
input statement. In particular, the file position for such an input
file when the processor is in the middle of consuming an r*c value,
and a child input statement is invoked, is not defined.  This was an
oversight.  Edits are supplied to prohibit r*c constants is this
case.

EDITS:

     consume all <r> values of that <r*c> constant before causing any
     child input statement to be invoked and before terminating if a
     parent input statement is active."

TITLE: The BIND attribute for C_PTR and C_FUNPTR
KEYWORDS: BIND attribute, C_PTR, C_FUNPTR, private components
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

1. Do the derived types C_PTR and C_FUNPTR have the BIND
attribute?

This affects whether an object of one of these types is permitted
directly in COMMON.  C589, p. 98 states "If a common-block-object is
of a derived type, it shall be a sequence type (4.5.1) or a
type with the BIND attribute and it shall have no default
initialization."

It also affects whether the types are extensible. 4.5.6 states
"A nonsequence derived type that does not have the BIND attribute is
an extensible type."

2. 15.2.2 states that C_PTR and C_FUNPTR are derived types with
private components. Are user-defined derived types with the BIND
attribute permitted to have private components?

ANSWER:

1. Yes, it was intended that these types have the BIND attribute.
An edit makes this clear.

2. A user-defined derived type with the BIND attribute is permitted
to have private components.

DISCUSSION:

1. It was intended that the behaviour of these types be similar to
that of user-declared derived types in all respects except that
they interoperate with C pointer types rather than C struct types.
As well as the two cases cited in the question, there are special
conditions in a pointer assignment statement (7.4.2) if either the
pointer or the target has the BIND attribute. Also, there is a
restriction on types with the BIND attribute in a SELECT TYPE
statement (8.1.5).

2. The rules for the interoperability of a C struct type with a
Fortran derived type are less restrictive than the rules in
4.5.1.3 that determine whether two separately declared Fortran
types, both with the BIND attribute, are the same. For the types
to be the same, the names of corresponding components must agree and
all components must be public. It follows that two types may be
different although they both interoperate with the same C struct
type.

EDITS:

Page and line numbers refer to 04-007.

"Each has the BIND attribute but is not interoperable with any C

The following is given as input to this program:

10.9.1.1 of Fortran 2003 (Null values) states:

    A slash encountered as a value separator during execution of a
    list-directed input statement causes termination of execution of
    that input statement after the assignment of the previous value.

If a child data transfer statement encounters a slash as a value
separator, it is unclear whether this statement applies to just the
child statement, or to the parent data transfer statement as well.
The significance for any subsequent child statement is also unclear.

What is the behaviour of this program when it is given the specified
input?


ANSWER:

When a child data transfer statement encounters a slash as a value
separator, only that data transfer statement encounters the slash.
None of its parent data transfer statements encounters the slash.
Only the data transfer statement that encounters the slash is
terminated.

The program above should print the following:
 1044.2167.3977.25.1.2.3
where "." represents a value separator.

QUESTION:

Can namelist I/O ever invoke a user-defined derived-type I/O
procedure?

10.10.1.2 of Fortran 2003 (Namelist input values) implies that
namelist input cannot invoke a user-defined derived-type I/O
procedure.  It says that, for a derived-type variable, "the effect is
as if the variable represented were expanded into a sequence of scalar
list items of intrinsic data types", which would preclude any
derived-type I/O.

However, the same sentence says that this is done "in the same way
that formatted input/output list items are expanded (9.5.2)", which
would result in some effective list items of derived type.

9.5.3.6 and 9.5.3.7.2 also imply that a user-defined derived-type I/O
procedure could be invoked for a namelist group object.

Yes, namelist I/O can invoke a user-defined derived-type I/O
procedure.  Edits are provided to correct this problem.

        END TYPE
        TYPE(t2) a(10)
        CALL abc(a(2))
      END PROGRAM

During the execution of "xyz", the dummy argument "d" is sequence
associated with the associated actual argument (which is true if "d"
has either explicit shape or assumed size).  This implies that the
entity that is argument associated with "d" must be contiguous.

The dummy argument "b" of the module subroutine "abc" is polymorphic,
and its dynamic type in this case is different than its declared type.
In this scoping unit, "xyz" has an implicit interface, so we know it
doesn't have any polymorphic arguments.  So, the dummy argument of
"xyz" must be nonpolymorphic, and have the same declared type as the
actual argument (b(2)).

This implies that we only want to pass the parent portion of b(2).
But the dummy argument of "xyz" may be an explicit-shape or
assumed-size array (in this case, it is an explicit-shape array).

This means that we have to pass a contiguous array to "xyz".  This
wouldn't be a problem if the dynamic type of "b" was the same as the
declared type, but in this case it is not.  The parent portion of "b"
(from element 2 to the end of the array) must be copied into a
temporary array.

The compiler cannot possibly know how big "b" is because it is an
assumed-size array, so it is impossible to make such a copy.

No, this program was not intended to be standard-conforming.  Edits

          END SUBROUTINE
        END INTERFACE
      END PROGRAM

C1212 appears to prohibit the case of an interface name in a procedure
declaration statement being the name of something declared in a later
procedure declaration statement.  But it does not appear to prohibit
the case of an interface name being the name of something declared in
a later interface body.

In the above program, the characteristics of p rely on the
characteristics of sub.  The characteristics of sub, in turn, rely on
the characteristics of p.

Is this program standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

No, this program is not standard-conforming.  The interface name in a
procedure declaration statement should not be permitted to be declared
in a later interface body.  An edit is supplied to correct this
oversight.

QUESTION:

Given
  REAL X
  X = ... some value ...
may
  IF( X+3.0 .EQ. 3.0 )...
be transformed into
  IF( X .EQ. 0.0 )...
by the processor?

References are to J3/04-007.

7.1.8.3 Evaluation of numeric intrinsic operations has a discussion of
"mathematically equivalent", "mathematical value" and "computational
results".

7.1.8.5 Evaluation of relational intrinsic operations has "Two
relational intrinsic operations are relationally equivalent if their
logical values are equal for all possible values of their primaries."

"values" in that context is ambiguous to me.  Is it the infinite set
of mathematical values or is it the finite set of hardware
representable (computational) values?

My brief scan of F2003 finds that "values" without any adjectives
means what the hardware can represent.

Assuming "values" in 7.1.8.5 means what the hardware can represent,
then I conclude that the transformation cannot be done.  However, Note
7.22 shows "I > J" transformed into "J-I < 0"; which is not true for
the finite set of hardware values (due to undefined behavior of
overflow), but is true for the infinite set of mathematical values.

I believe that "possible values" should be changed to either:
  possible mathematical values 
or
  possible computational values

QUESTION:

Given
  REAL X
  X = ... some value ...
  IF( (X+3.0) .EQ. 3.0 )...  
may the X+3.0 be computed with more range and/or precision than that
of REAL?  In other words, is PRECISION(X) .EQ. PRECISION(X+3.0) always
true; or is PRECISION(X) .LT. PRECISION(X+3.0) sometimes true?

References are to J3/04-007.

2.4.1.1 Intrinsic type has "The kind type parameter indicates ... the
decimal precision and exponent range for the real and complex types,
..."

7.1.4.2 Type, type parameters, and shape of the result of an operation
has in (4) "For an expression x1 op x2 where op is a numeric intrinsic
binary operator with both operands of the same type and kind type
parameters, ..., the kind type parameter of the expression is
identical to that of each operand."

Since X and 3.0 are the same type and have the same kind type
parameters, 7.1.4.2 (4) appears to require the X+3.0 have just the
range and precision of REAL; no more, no less (otherwise, the
precision is not identical).  But, several members of the J3 email
list have said that the "+" may be done with more precision; using
either 1.4(6) or 7.1.8.3 as the reason.

Perhaps something alone the lines of "The values of floating operands
and of the results of floating expressions may be represented in
greater precision and range than that required by the kind type
parameter; the kind type parameter is not changed thereby." should be
added to 7.1.4.2(4).

QUESTION:

Is PRECISION(X) .EQ. PRECISION(X+3.0) always true? 

ANSWER:

Yes, that is the definition of PRECISION.  The PRECISION intrinsic has
nothing to do with the precision in which the computation X+3.0 is
computed.  7.1.4.2 (4) only describes the precision of the end result
of the computation.

The weasel words in 1.4 (6) allow the processor to compute this expression
in higher precision than REAL.

TITLE: Accuracy of conversion of real literal constants
KEYWORDS: conversion, accuracy
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

The following is independent of IEEE-754.

Fortran 2003 10.6.1.2.6 covers conversions between "decimal values"
and "internal values" and has some strong requirements.

Are there equivalent requirements on accuracy for conversions of real
literal constants?  Sections 4.1.2 and 4.4.2 seems like the places to
find them (if they exist).

What rounding mode is used for conversions of real literal constants?
Is the same rounding mode used for all such conversions?

The following four questions are about positive values, but the same
would apply to negative values.

Must all "decimal values" in the range smallest non-zero finite
internal value (which could be a denormal) to largest finite internal
value, e.g. 0.1, be converted?

Must all "decimal values" in the range zero to smallest non-zero
finite internal value, e.g. 1.0e-999999999, be converted?

Must all "decimal values" larger than the largest finite internal
value, e.g. 9.9e+99999999999, be converted if infinity is an internal
value?  What does nearest rounding mean for these cases?

What requirements exist for "decimal values" larger than the largest
finite internal value if infinity is not an internal value?

ANSWER:

There are no requirements on accuracy for conversions of real literal
constants.

The standard does not specify the rounding mode used for conversions
of real literal constants, nor does it require the same rounding mode
to be used for all conversions.

Whether all decimal values in any range can be converted is not
standardized.

There are no requirements for "decimal values" larger than the largest
finite internal value whether infinity is an internal value or not.

QUESTION:

The last sentence of 10.10.2.2 of Fortran 2003 states:
    Except for continuation of delimited character sequences, each
    output record begins with a blank character.

If a namelist output statement causes a user-defined derived-type
output procedure to be called, was it intended to be standard-
conforming for that procedure to create a new record (perhaps by using
the slash edit descriptor) that does not begin with a blank character?

ANSWER:

Yes, this situation was intended to be standard-conforming.  Explicit formatting
in user-defined derived-type output is not required to output a leading blank
in this case.  An edit is provided to correct this oversight.

In 12.3.2.1.1 of Fortran 2003, at [262:8-9], the following is stated
about the dummy arguments of a function that defines an operation:
    The dummy arguments shall be nonoptional dummy data objects and
    shall be specified with INTENT (IN).

This clearly states that a dummy argument of such a function cannot be
a procedure pointer.  The same is not stated for the dummy arguments
of a subroutine that defines assignment.

Was it intended that procedure pointers should be allowed in defined
assignment, but not in defined operations?

No.  It was not intended that procedure pointers should be allowed in
either defined assignment or defined operations.  An edit is provided

TITLE: Can child I/O statements be advancing I/O statements?
KEYWORDS: UDDTIO, ADVANCE=
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

[175:30-31] of Fortran 2003 states:
    An advancing input/output statement always positions a record file
    after the last record read or written, unless there is an error
    condition.

Since a child I/O statement does not position a file after the last
Record [194:19][199:8-9], this implies that a child I/O statement cannot 
be an advancing I/O statement.

[189:6-9] of Fortran 2003 states:
    The ADVANCE= specifier determines whether advancing input/output
    occurs for this input/output statement. If YES is specified,
    advancing input/output occurs. If NO is specified, nonadvancing
    input/output occurs (9.2.3.1). If this specifier is omitted from
    an input/output statement that allows the specifier, the default
    value is YES.

This clearly states that any data transfer statement is an advancing
I/O statement if the value 'NO' is not specified for the ADVANCE=
specifier.

These two statements seem to contradict each other. 

QUESTION:

If a child I/O statement does not have an ADVANCE= specifier with the
value 'NO', is it an advancing I/O statement?

DISCUSSION:

The answer to this question affects the value for the IOSTAT variable
for child READ statements in some situations.  For example, in the
following program, the value of "stat1" should be equal to IOSTAT_EOF
if the child READ statement is advancing, but it should be equal to
IOSTAT_EOR if the statement is nonadvancing.

      MODULE m
        TYPE t
          CHARACTER(2) :: x(2)
        CONTAINS
          PROCEDURE :: readT
          GENERIC :: READ(FORMATTED) => readT
        END TYPE
      CONTAINS
        SUBROUTINE readT(dtv, unit, iotype, v_list, iostat, iomsg)
          CLASS(t), INTENT(INOUT) :: dtv
          INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: unit
          CHARACTER(*), INTENT(IN) :: iotype
          INTEGER, INTENT(IN)  :: v_list(:)
          INTEGER, INTENT(OUT) :: iostat
          CHARACTER(*), INTENT(INOUT) :: iomsg
          READ (unit, '(2a2)', IOSTAT=iostat) dtv%x
        END SUBROUTINE
      END MODULE

      PROGRAM p
        USE m
        USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
        TYPE(t) t1
        CHARACTER(3) :: c = '123'
        INTEGER stat1
        READ (c, *, IOSTAT=stat1) t1
        PRINT *, (stat1 == IOSTAT_EOR), (stat1 == IOSTAT_EOF)

No, such a child I/O statement is not advancing.  Edits are provided

TITLE: Subroutine/function ambiguity in generics
KEYWORDS: subroutine, generic, implicit
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

 Q1. Is the following generic allowed?
 
     interface q
       subroutine qr(f)
         implicit real(f)
         external f
       end subroutine
       subroutine qc(f)
         implicit complex(f)
         external f
       end subroutine
     end interface q

     The uncertainly arises because it is not established
     whether F is a subroutine or a function. If either F
     were a subroutine, then it would be clear that the
     generic was disallowed. One might be able to use this
     to deduce that both Fs must be functions. This seems
     like an obscure deduction to demand of the compiler.

 Q2. Consider the following "obviously" allowed generic
 
     module m
       interface q
         subroutine qr(f)
           real, external :: f
         end subroutine
         subroutine qc(f)
           complex, external :: f
         end subroutine
       end interface q
     end module m

     Is the following main program valid?
    
     program main
       use m
       external ff
       call q(ff)
     end
     
     Again, the problem is that it is unclear whether of not
     ff is a function or subroutine. If it is a subroutine,
     then the call is ambiguous. One might thus deduce that
     ff must be a function, and therefore of type real,
     but this seems like an obscure deduction to demand of
     the compiler.

ANSWER:

 I'm not sure. But presumably either the compiler is required
 to make the mentioned deductions or the code must be
 nonconforming. If the code is intended to be nonconforming,
 edits to say so might be needed.

DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Consider
  TYPE t(len)
    INTEGER,LEN :: len
    CHARACTER(len) :: cvalue = "xyz"
  END TYPE

  SUBROUTINE s(n)
    TYPE(t(n)) x
    ...

    TYPE(t(len2)) :: tvalue = t(10,"fred nurke")
  END TYPE

  SUBROUTINE s2(n)
    TYPE(t(n)) :: y
    ...

The type definition for T appears to conform to the standard; it
allows an "automatic" component to be default initialized.  However,
the declaration of the local variable X in subroutine S will
initialize the component differently depending on the value of N, for
example, giving the CVALUE component the value "", "x", "xy", "xyz",
"xyz " for N being 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively.

Q1. Was it intended that "automatic" components can be
    default-initialized?

If the answer is "Yes", the type definition for T2 also appears to
conform to the standard.  However, the declaration of Y in S2 will not
work if N has any value other than 10 at run time.  This is
surprising;  there appears to be no other situation where the runtime
value of a length type parameter can render a declaration invalid.
Is this situation intentional?

ANSWER:

Q1. No, this was not intended.  An edit is supplied to fix this.

Q2. Not applicable.
