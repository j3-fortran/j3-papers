1. Introduction

This paper addresses UTI 111, in conjunction with the Terms and definitions
paper which has not yet been written.

2. Notation

As an experiment I am going to be using

  <ref> <<is>> [ <page-no> : <subclause-no> p <para-no> ]
        <<or>> [ <page-no> : <subclause-no> p <para-no> + <line offset> ]
        <<or>> [ <page-no> : Note <number> ]
        <<or>> [ <page-no> : UTI <number> ]

to refer to the standard by paragraphs instead of page/line.
For example, [461:15.2.3.1p2+3] is on page 461 and is the fourth line of
paragraph 2 of subclause 15.2.3.1.

(This is a bit more verbose than our usual one: for a start, the page
number is redundant, but it makes it faster to find things on paper.)

3. Discussion

(a) There are some edits to do with notes here, which have nothing to do
    with UTI 111 apart from being in fairly close proximity.

(b) The term "address" is not actually defined by the C standard, nor by
    the vocabulary standard that it references.  Grr.

4. Edits to 07-007r1

[460:15.2.2 Note 15.2]
  Delete this nonsensical meaningless note.
{A "companion processor" cannot "support more than one variety of float",
 because by the C standard itself there is only one variety of float!
 Under the meaning of the act, a C compiler that uses command-line switches
 to control the meaning of "float" is providing more than one C
 implementation or companion processor.

 In any case, the need for some means of choosing which companion processor
 (whether expressed in a single program via options or via multiply
 programs) is in no sense limited to float, double and long double.
 Therefore this note is not just meaningless and incorrect, it is also
 misleading!

 And in no sense would it justify breaking up the subclause by plonking it
 in the middle either (the ISO guidelines say notes go at the end of the
 subclause unless there is good reason), even were it not incorrect and
 misleading.}

[460:15.2.2 Note 15.3]
  Move this note to the end of the subclause (4 lines down).
{Editorial.}

[461:15.2.3.1p2]
  Delete unnecessary and misplaced paragraph.
{It contains lots of unnecessary witter, as mentioned in the UTI, and what
 little content it does have is faulty.}

[461: UTI 111]
  Delete UTI when satisfied it has been resolved.

Add the following definition to the terms and definitions clause.
  "2.5.10.x
   <<C address>>
   the address of an object either defined by the companion processor or
   which might be accessible to the companion processor; this is the same
   concept which the C International Standard calls the address.

   [ref to C standard]"
{The placement is deliberately vague because our terms and definitions
 clause does not yet adhere to the ISO rules.  Anyway, 2.5.10 is where we
 talk about companion processors right now, so is a good place for it on
 a temporary basis.}

[7:1.9 all paragraphs but the first]
  Sort into ISO number order.
{There is no particularly useful order (importance?!) for the references,
 so we should just list them in numeric order.}
