Re:  WG5/N1557

J3 responses to WG5 paper N1557.  Many comments are processed in
different papers.  These papers are noted here, but the details of
the WG5 comments and responses are deleted here.  Note that the
J3 papers cited may have subsequent revisions and pointers to
additional papers.

N1524

Page and line numbers in paper N1524 refer to 02-007r3. WG5 used these
line numbers as well as those from the present draft (03-007).
To avoid confusion, these J3 responses will only use the 03-007
page and line numbers

    paper 03-126
                14.9.21 now refers to 14.10.23. WG5 agrees;
                proposed edits:
        383:11-13 Replace "Here, ... values" -> "Here,
                support is as defined in the first paragraph of 14.8".
        370:29-30: "available" -> "supported"

    paper 03-125r1
        85:10   Delete "(if any)"
        85:12   Delete "(if any)"

    paper 03-130r2
               225:30 now refers to 230:6 and 17. WG5 agrees;
               proposed edit:
        230:17: "The" -> "An".
        230:17: "for" -> "that is".

                 "otherwises". WG5 agrees; proposed edits
       230:28 Before "otherwise" change comma to semicolon.
       230:33 Change "Otherwise" to "For an internal
                      value that is neither an IEEE Infinity nor a NaN".
       231:10 Change "Otherwise" to "For an internal
                      value that is neither an IEEE Infinity nor a NaN".
       232:2  Change "Otherwise" to "For an internal
                      value that is neither an IEEE Infinity nor a NaN".
       232:24 Change "Otherwise" to "For an internal
                      value that is neither an IEEE Infinity nor a NaN".

    paper 03-131r1
                WG5 agrees; proposed edit to simplify table:
      371:38-372:22 Change the 12 right hand table entries
                  from "Inquire whether the processor supports XXX"
                  to
                 "Are IEEE exceptions supported?"
                 "Is IEEE halting control supported?"
                 "Is IEEE arithmetic supported?"
                 "Are IEEE denormal numbers supported?"
                 "Is IEEE divide supported?"
                 "Is IEEE infinity supported?"
                 "Is IEEE formatting supported?"
                 "Are IEEE NaNs supported?"
                 "Is IEEE rounding supported?"
                 "Is IEEE square root supported?"
                 "Are all IEEE facilities supported?"
                 "Is IEEE underflow supported?"

J3 recognizes that these are brief descriptions, but, combined with the
function name, they should allow a reasonably naive user to locate the
correct function.

    paper 03-138r1         See J3/03-225

    paper 03-154r3
              24:17 WG5 agrees; proposed edit:
        24:17  Replace "relevant standard" by
              "ISO/IEC 646:1991 (International Reference Version) and
               ISO/IEC 10646-1:2000 UCS-4, respectively"

              40:13+ now refers to 42:12-13. WG5 agrees; proposed edits:
                    (Note that 03-208R1 also makes edits in this area)
        42:12-13 Replace by:
              "The collating sequence for the ASCII character type is as
              defined by ISO/IEC 646:1991 (International Reference Version);
              this collating sequence is called the
              <<ASCII collating sequence>> in this standard."

        42:13+ Replace NOTE 4.16 by:
              "The intrinsic functions ACHAR (13.7.2) and IACHAR (13.7.45)
              provide conversion between characters and corresponding
              integer values according to the ASCII collating sequence."

        143:12    Delete "the" twice

              193:14 now refers to 195:25-196:1. Rejected by WG5,
              because it was intended this way (default character type
              might contain characters not suitable for an ASCII internal
              file, while an ISO 10646 internal file is suited for all
              characters).

              195:21-196:1 WG5 recommends to leave "contain" as is;
                           "item" is a term well defined in this section.

              224:14+ now refers to 228:11+. The conversion mentioned here
              applies to all subsequent data editing, so it is in the
              right place; WG5 recommends to do nothing.
              "Conversion" issue: The conversion mentioned in 10.6 is
              concerned with the conversion caused by data edit descriptors.
              WG5 recommends to do nothing.

              210:12+ now refers to 214:17+. WG5 does not understand the
              problem; this issue does not arise with formatted files.

        351:14-25+  Delete from "The following example..." through to
                   and including NOTE 13.18

              Remind the editor to look at note 4.14 which has a similar
              typesetting problem.

    paper 03-155r1
        308:7.   after "X < 0," insert " then"
        308:8.   insert a comma between "negative real zero" and "and".
        331:10.  after "of X is zero, " insert "then "
        331:12   insert a comma between "negative real zero" and "and".

    paper 03-157r1
              268:7 now refers to 274:7.  WG5 rejects this change.  The
              definition of C character kind type is in 15.1.1;
              WG5 disagrees with moving it.
              405:36 now refers to 418:7.  Same issue.
         No edits

    paper 03-159r2
                  351:37-38 WG5 agrees; proposes edit:
        351:37-38  Replace "2 ... respectively" with "two integer kinds, 32
                   with representation method r=2 and q=31, and 64 with
                   representation method r=2 and q=63".

    paper 03-162r2

              110:24-25 now refers to 113:1+. WG5 proposes the following
              alternative edits:
        113:6 Delete "An allocatable variable has a status of
              <<unallocated>> if it is not allocated.".
        113:7 Change "unallocated" to "<<unallocated>>".
        113:8 Change "an allocation" to "the allocation".
               287:15 now refers to 293:15. WG5 agrees that MOVE_ALLOC is not
               elemental; it is pure, though.  Proposed edit:
        293:15 Replace the first sentence with:
                "The subroutine MOVE_ALLOC and the elemental subroutine
                MVBITS are pure."
               [13.5.14+1] now refers to 299:28. WG5 proposes the following:
        299:28 Replace "procedures" by "procedure".
        299:29 Replace "Transfers" by "Moves".
        299:29 Replace "allocatiom" by "allocation".          Spelling error
        339:24 Replace "Transfers" by "Moves".
        339:29 Change "remains" to "becomes".
        340:3 Change "such a pointer" to "any pointer associated with FROM
              on entry".
        340:8 Add closing parenthesis to the ALLOCATE statement.

                 WG5 thinks the other parts of 13.7.82 are OK.
                 404:29+ now refers to 416:29.  WG5 agrees that this is wrong.
                 Proposed edit:
        416:28-29 Replace by
                "The allocation transfer procedure (13.7.82) is executed
                with the pointer associated with the argument FROM and an
                object without the target attribute associated with the
                argument TO."
