Subject: Erroneous constraint in CRITICAL
Date: 6 May 2009
References:


Constraint C810 is not statically checkable, because it is not always
possible to tell if a statement is an image control statement.  In
addition, the image control statement may occur inside a subroutine
whose code is not known to the compiler.

Edits:

[174:18] In 8.1.5, after paragraph 1, replace constraint 810 by the
paragraph:

    "An image control statement shall not be executed during the
    execution of the body of a CRITICAL construct."
