This "r1" document is a copy of the original 21-101, with the
explanatory text and the Alternative 1 edits REMOVED.  Only the
ALTERNATIVE 2 edits that were passed at meeting #223 are contained
herein.  These edits remove support for BOZ-literal constants as
a list item in output statements, such as WRITE.  The user can still
use INT(Z'123abc')   as a list item.

--- START OF EDITS, alternative 2

[240:11+]: add a new paragraph
    "An output list shall not contain an effective list item that is
     a boz-literal-constant."

[271:4]: delete the sentence
    "The B, O, and Z edit descriptors can also be used to specify the
     output of boz-literal-constants."

[271:27-32]: delete list item (8)

[271:32+] Delete Unresolved Technical Issue 008
