Discussion
----------

In his ballot comments (N1971), Reinhold Bader has drawn attention to
deficiencies in the FORM SUBTEAM statement:

1. It is not made clear that the intention is that all the images of
the current team must participate in corresponding FORM SUBTEAM
statements.

2. It is not made clear that the intention is that corresponding
FORM SUBTEAMS statements must participate with corresponding team
variables. For example, it was not intended that a team be formed
by some images of the current team executing
        FORM SUBTEAM(I,TEAM(1))
and the rest executing
        FORM SUBTEAM(I,TEAM(2))

3. It is desirable for a team to be defined by data that is spread
over the set of its team variables on all its images. Data that
aids efficient execution as a team can be established during the
execution of FORM SUBTEAM.

4. It is not clear how SYNC TEAM can work unless it is restricted
to teams that are unchanged since they last participated in a
CHANGE TEAM construct, because each team is defined by the values of
the subteam-ids on the images of its parent team and identifying it
is a collective calculation involving the parent team.

Reinhold suggests that the FORM SUBTEAM statement be replaced by
a collective subroutine. This idea has been discussed by the
subgroup and rejected. The main reasons were that an intrinsic
subroutine can be overridden by the user, leading to confusing code;
and there is symmetry with having FORM SUBTEAM and CHANGE TEAM both
statements.

The edits suggested here are intended to remedy the problems directly.

Additionally, variables of type TEAM_TYPE should have restrictions
similar to those of type LOCK_TYPE. Edits for subclause 5.2 are
supplied for this.

Edits are also supplied to specify that the team-variable in SYNC TEAM
is restricted to be that formed by the current team or an ancestor
thereof.


Edits to N1967:
---------------

[9:21+] Add two constraints to 5.2 TEAM_TYPE:

"C50x A team variable shall not appear in a variable definition
     context except as the <team-variable> in a FORM SUBTEAM
     statement, as an <allocate-object> in an ALLOCATE statement without
     a SOURCE=<alloc-opt>, or as an actual argument in a reference to a
     procedure with an explicit interface where the corresponding dummy
     argument has INTENT (INOUT).

C50y A variable with a subobject of type TEAM_TYPE shall not have the
     POINTER attribute and shall not appear in a variable definition
     context except as an <allocate-object> in an ALLOCATE statement
     without a SOURCE=<alloc-opt>, or as an actual argument in a reference
     to a procedure with an explicit interface where the corresponding
     dummy argument has INTENT (INOUT)."

[10:22+] Add paragraph: "If the FORM SUBTEAM statement is executed on
one image, it shall be executed by the same statement on all
images of the current team, in execution segments that are not ordered
with respect to each other.  If <team-variable> contains any
subscripts, the values of each shall be the same on all these
statements."

[10:26-27] Replace the first sentence after R507 with:

"The value of <team-variable> shall have been established by an
execution of FORM SUBTEAM by the current team or an ancestor of the
current team. Execution of a SYNC TEAM statement performs a
synchronization of the team specified by <team_variable>."
