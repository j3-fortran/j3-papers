From: R. Bader
Subject: TR29113 - a non-descriptor variant
Date: 2009 April 17
References: N1761, N1766

This is an opinionated attempt to provide the TR's functionality without
descriptors. Account is taken of various (but probably not all)
objections voiced during the balloting procedure on N1761 by

* improving proper separation of concerns: users should not be required
  to manipulate Fortran wiring hanging out on the C side since all they
  want is to get at the data contained within a dummy argument, or define
  an entity with properties which are not normally available within C,
  which can then be provided as a dummy argument to a Fortran procedure,
* putting the onus on the processor to auto-generate code which under
  the present proposal must be inserted manually, and thereby improve
  usability,
* enabling those vendors who do not use full-featured descriptors
  to more easily implement the extended C interoperation,
* enabling support for the combination of the OPTIONAL and VALUE
  attributes,
* being flexible enough for future extension, especially since multiple
  types of descriptors might be used on the Fortran side for various
  classes of dummy arguments. Another area of interest might be (at
  least limited) support for vararg interfaces.

To this end, three types and five function calls are defined.
Five examples illustrate the use of the extended facilities.

Scope of the extended interoperability:
---------------------------------------

The following table gives an overview of the support for C interoper-
ability for the various possibilities of Fortran dummy arguments and
their attributes. A "2003" entry indicates direct interoperability as
described in the Fortran 2003/2008 standard, a "TR" entry denotes
functionality which is required to be provided via the Technical Report.
The TR's prescriptions should not preclude extensions in future re-
visions of the standard. In particular, under the scheme proposed here,
a "handle" entry means that an interoperable interface can be created,
while Fortran-generated data in an entity with the given characteristics
will not be accessible from C by using the facilities from Fortran
2008 + TR (but may be accessible in a processor-dependent manner).

Since for non-interoperable entities of intrinsic type which are static
scalars or explicit-shape arrays or assumed-size arrays portability
can not be guaranteed, they are marked "no" in the above table.
For the "no" entries, constraints should be retained or added to
prevent non-conforming code from being compiled. Assumed/dynamic
rank entities are further commented upon in 09-185. Section IV. provides
some remarks about assumed type.

For extended C interoperability the Fortran processor must provide a
unitary header ISO_Fortran_binding.h which provides all type definitions,
named constants and function prototypes needed for C code making use of
the extended facilities. The namespace used for all C entities is
defined by using CFI_ as their first four characters.


I. Declarations and attributes:
-------------------------------

A non-interoperable Fortran entity will be handled from C via a proxy
object. To this end, ISO_Fortran_binding.h defines a type named
CFI_f_obj. Any object of this type will in the following be called
a Fortran object; it may be a variable created within C or a dummy
argument. The possible states of such an object with respect to its
dynamic attribute are described by a set of named constants of type
CFI_dyn_attr which may be one of the following:

  CFI_attribute_undefined     (for a C-defined variable before
                               Fortran attributes have been set
                               at run time)
  CFI_attribute_allocatable
  CFI_attribute_pointer
  CFI_attribute_static        (for a dummy argument which does not
                               have the ALLOCATABLE or POINTER
                               attribute)

COMMENT: In effect, a Fortran object created within C will initially
         be an unallocated assumed rank entity of anonymous type.

With exception of calls to CFI_allocate() or CFI_c_f_obj() (see
below), the dynamic attribute of a Fortran object will be implicitly
determined. A change of the dynamic attribute is only allowed if
its present value is CFI_attribute_undefined.
While it is recommended to use Fortran implementations for dynamic
allocation of memory (which will attend to all of the above issues
in a TKR-safe manner), a facility to do this is also provided here
for the case where the element size is known to the C programmer;
for interoperable entities, sizeof(<used-type>) would typically
be provided as elem_size argument:

  int CFI_allocate(CFI_f_obj *obj, CFI_shape shape[], int rank, \
                   size_t elem_size, CFI_dyn_attr attr);

The shape argument of type must be an array of size rank and type
CFI_shape, describing the bounds and strides to be provided to the
Fortran object:

typedef struct {
  size_t lbound
  size_t ubound
  size_t stride
} CFI_shape

The constant CFI_MAX_RANK giving the maximum rank of arrays supported
by the processor is provided as a convenience.

CFI_allocate returns

  CFI_status_success    (allocation successful. This also applies
                         if the resulting array is zero-sized)
  CFI_status_allocated  (cannot reallocate an already allocated
                         entity with the ALLOCATABLE attribute)
  CFI_status_invalid    (One of the arguments was invalid:
                         non-allocatable Fortran object,
                         rank out of range or invalid
                         shape specifier e.g., a stride unequal
                         to 1, or invalid dynamic attribute)
  CFI_status_fail       (failed to provision needed memory).

The dynamic attribute attr may be one of CFI_attribute_allocatable,
CFI_attribute_pointer. However, the Fortran object must at input
either have the attribute CFI_attribute_undefined, or its dynamic
attribute must be consistent with what is provided in the attr
argument. To check the allocation status of a Fortran object, the
function

  int CFI_allocated(CFI_f_obj *obj);

can be used, which returns

  CFI_status_allocated    (entity is an allocated ALLOCATABLE)
  CFI_status_unallocated  (entity is an unallocated ALLOCATABLE)
  CFI_status_invalid      (invalid argument:
                           Fortran object has the POINTER attribute
                           or is undefined or non-allocatable).

For deallocation one has

  int CFI_deallocate(CFI_f_obj *obj);

with the return values

  CFI_status_success      (deallocation successful)
  CFI_status_unallocated  (cannot deallocate an unallocated entity)
  CFI_status_invalid      (invalid or non-dynamic argument)
  CFI_status_fail         (failed to free memory).

 Open questions:
 (1) Can one expect ALLOCATABLE Fortran objects defined in C to become
     deallocated when the scope is left? If not, should this behaviour
     not also be pointed out in the TR?
 (2) For entities with the POINTER attribute it might also be
     appropriate to provide additional facilities, at least
     NULLification and query on ASSOCIATEDness. This is also not
     specified in N1761.
 (3) For entities which are of non-interoperable type (intrinsic,
     derived or dynamically typed), no support for definition inside
     a C routine is provided. With the interface mapping described in
     the next chapter, it will however be possible to hand Fortran-
     defined entities of such types through intermediate C code.
     Referencing or defining such entities in C will be processor
     dependent.


II. Interface Mapping:
----------------------

Since for non-interoperable arguments no direct counterpart to the
Fortran dummy argument exists in C, two names shall be defined for
all BIND(C) interfaces which contain at least one non-interoperable
argument:
  * the local Fortran name, which will be dereferenced if the
    procedure is called from Fortran,
  * an additional C interface (the "mapped interface") which fully
    conforms to the C standard, and which will be dereferenced
    if called by the companion processor.
The processor needs to be able to disambiguate between interoperable
and non-interoperable arguments i.e., interoperability of an argument
must be included as a characteristic of the Fortran interface. If a
label is provided on the BIND statement, the name of the mapped
interface must match this label. The interface corresponding to the
local Fortran name must be explicit.

Argument resolution is performed as follows: Each interoperable
argument will be handed on as-is and treated in the C interface in the
same manner as within the scope of Fortran 2003/8 C interoperation. For
every non-interoperable argument for which mapping is supported,
the dummy argument in the mapped interface shall be a pointer of
type CFI_f_obj.

For functions with a non-interoperable function result, a mapped
interface must be created even if all dummy arguments are interoperable.
The mapped C function then creates an object which is a pointer to an
entity of type CFI_f_obj. This entity can be C-deallocated using free(),
possibly after execution of CFI_deallocate().

COMMENT: N1761 does not have anything to say about non-interoperable
         function results.

For execution of the mapped interface calls, the following rules apply:

Case 1 - Implementation in Fortran:
-----------------------------------

This is the case where the procedure is either a module procedure or
an external procedure (which must have the BIND(C) attribute)
described by an explicit interface (which then may *not* have the
BIND(C) attribute, cf. Case 2 below). The local Fortran name
dereferences to the procedure created by the programmer. The mapped
interface is a wrapper procedure created by the processor which
performs the following execution sequence when called from a
companion processor:

(1) For each non-interoperable dummy argument, the corresponding
    Fortran object is checked:
    * If it is undefined, processing shall abort, unless the Fortran
      dummy argument is ALLOCATABLE or POINTER and not INTENT(IN),
      in which case the interface-specified attribute is inherited
      by the Fortran object. Similarly, the rank will then also be
      inherited from the Fortran interface.
    * If it (then) is defined, its type is regarded as being that
      of the corresponding dummy argument in the Fortran interface.
      NOTE: A processor may provide run time type consistency checks
      as a convenience. N1761 has a long list of intrinsic types,
      but the programmer can cheat anyway, and different derived
      types cannot be disambiguated, so why care at all?
    * If the dummy argument in the Fortran interface has the ALLOCATABLE
      or POINTER attribute and the corresponding Fortran object does
      not have the same attribute or the attribute
      CFI_attribute_undefined, processing shall abort.
    * If the Fortran object has a defined rank which is not compatible
      with the rank in the Fortran interface, processing shall abort.

Open question: Since some properties which in Fortran are checked at
      compile time can in this context only be checked at run time,
      the cop-out of aborting processing was choses to prevent
      the worst inconsistencies.

(2) The Fortran procedure is invoked based on the argument resolution
    rules described above.

(3) If necessary due to a change inside the Fortran procedure, the
    properties of the Fortran object are updated. If the procedure is
    a function, the newly created result object must encompass a clone
    of the Fortran function result.


Case 2 - Implementation within a companion processor:
-----------------------------------------------------

The module procedure may be implemented by the companion processor.
While this is supposed to be the exception, this case might for
example be relevant for efficient implementation of a C wrapper
to MPI (see example 4 below).
In Fortran, an explicit interface with the BIND(C) attribute,
but without an implementation, must be created by the programmer.
The local Fortran name then dereferences to a wrapper procedure
generated by the processor which performs the following execution
sequence when called from a Fortran program unit:

(1) For each non-interoperable dummy argument, a corresponding
    Fortran object is created. Its properties are inherited from
    the dummy argument, and the dummy argument is wrapped inside
    the Fortran object.
(2) The companion processor's implementation is invoked based on
    the argument resolution rules described above.
(3) All Fortran objects created in (1) above are destroyed without
    affecting the enclosed entities. If the procedure is a function
    with non-interoperable result, the result object generated by
    the implementation must be checked for consistency with respect
    to rank, storage size and dynamic attribute.


+++Example 1+++
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Calling a Fortran implementation based on assumed-shape arrays

module mod_foo
  use, intrinsic :: iso_c_binding ! extended by TR29113
  type, BIND(C) :: foo
    integer(c_int) :: i
    real(c_float) :: r(3)
    character(c_char) :: c
  end type
  interface
    subroutine process_foo(this) BIND(C)
      type(foo), intent(inout) :: this(:,:)
      :
    end subroutine
  end interface
contains
  subroutine construct_foo(this, stat) BIND(C, NAME='Construct_Foo')
    type(foo), allocatable, intent(out) :: this(:,:)
    integer(c_int), intent(out) :: stat
    : ! code for constructing "this" e.g., from a file
  end subroutine
  subroutine destruct_foo(this) BIND(C)
    type(foo), allocatable, intent(inout) :: this(:,:)
    :
  end subroutine construct_foo
end module mod_foo

For calling e.g., the constructor from C, the processor would create
a symbol with the following C signature:

void Construct_Foo(CFI_f_obj *fobj, int *stat);

The C client making use of these procedure calls might be

#include <ISO_Fortran_binding.h>

void Construct_Foo(CFI_f_obj *fobj, int *stat);
void destruct_foo(CFI_f_obj *fobj);
void process_foo(CFI_f_obj *fobj);

int main() {
  CFI_f_obj foo_fobj;
  int stat;

  Construct_Foo(&foo_fobj, stat);
  if (stat != 0) {
     process_foo(&foo_fobj);
  }
  destruct_foo(&foo_fobj);
}

In this example, no access to the data contained within the Fortran
object is (explicitly) required. As long as this is the case, even
certain variants of noninteroperable entities (as indicated in the
table above) can be handled via the mapped interface.
For a call of construct_foo from Fortran, the local Fortran name would
be invoked. It is imaginable and allowed that the programmer write

interface
  subroutine my_constructor(fobj, stat) BIND(C, NAME='Construct_Foo')
    use, intrinsic :: iso_c_binding
    type(c_ptr), value :: fobj
    integer(c_int), intent(out) :: stat
  end subroutine
end interface

thereby accessing the mapped C interface via a Fortran 2003 style
C-interoperable interface, but it would be - apart from the unnecessary
call overhead - much more cumbersome to use since the needed Fortran
objects need to be explicitly set up by writing additional C code.

+++End of Example 1+++


III. Transferring data between Fortran and C:
---------------------------------------------

In order to access the data contained inside a Fortran object from C,
either for reading or for writing, the following function is provided:

int CFI_f_c_pointer(CFI_f_obj *fobj, void *cptr, CFI_shape shape[], \
                    int *rank);

Given a Fortran object fobj, it returns
* a C pointer cptr which points to the C address of the first
  element of the entity if the Fortran object is defined and
  NULL otherwise.
* a pointer to an object "shape" of type CFI_shape with "rank" entries,
  which describes the shape of the object. If "rank" contains zero,
  shape will be the NULL pointer, and the Fortran object is a scalar.

The return status value may be one of

CFI_status_undefined        (Fortran object is undefined)
CFI_status_noninteroperable (Fortran object defined but with non-
                             interoperable entries - further processing
                             may or may not be supported)
CFI_status_interoperable    (Fortran object defined and can be processed
                             within C)
Processing of type information is performed at run time based
on the programmer's knowledge of the Fortran interface.

Open questions:
(1) Do we wish to explicitly handle INTENT or is this
    the programmer's responsibility?
(2) There was a complaint about not dealing with assumed length
    character entities. More generally, the storage layout issues
    of parameterized types with interoperable components would need
    to be addressed. Is this within the purview of the TR?

+++Example 2+++
  Expanding on Example 1, we now look at a C implementation of the
  module procedure "process_foo":

#include <ISO_Fortran_binding.h>

/* matching type definition */
typedef struct {
  int i;
  float r[3];
  char c;
} Foo;

/* function implementation */
void process_foo(CFI_f_obj *this) {
  Foo *foo_arg;
  CFI_shape fshape[CFI_MAX_RANK];
  int stat, rank;
  size_t i, j, index;

  stat = CFI_f_c_pointer(this, foo_arg, fshape, &rank);

  if (stat == CFI_status_interoperable && rank == 2) {
     for (i=fshape[0].lbound; i<=fshape[0].ubound; \
                                  i+=fshape[0].stride) {
       for (j=fshape[1].lbound; j<=fshape[1].ubound; \
                                    j+=fshape[1].stride) {
/* process this(j, i); hope I have index right ...  */
           index = (fshape[1].ubound - fshape[1].lbound + 1) * \
                   (i - fshape[0].lbound) + j - fshape[1].lbound
	   foo_arg[index] = (Foo) ...;
        }
     }
  } else {
/* error */
  }
}
+++End of Example 2+++


It is also possible to create a Fortran object from an existing C entity
by encapsulating the latter inside the former; for this purpose, the
function

  int CFI_c_f_obj(void *cptr, CFI_shape shape[], int rank, \
                  size_t elem_size, CFI_dyn_attr attr, CFI_f_obj *fobj);

is available. Since C objects do not have rank and shape information,
these must be imposed by providing the needed input. Since the type
information is not explicitly handed on, the element size of a single
item must be provided as input. The dynamic attribute may be
CFI_attribute_allocatable or CFI_attribute_pointer; it must however be
consistent with the Fortran objects' if the latter does not have
the attribute value CFI_attribute_undefined. If the dynamic attribute is
CFI_attribute_pointer, it is also permissible to use stride sizes
unequal to 1. The return value of this function is one of

  CFI_status_success    (creation of Fortran object successful)
  CFI_status_invalid    (one of the arguments was invalid:
                         NULL C pointer, rank out of range, invalid
                         shape specifier, or invalid dynamic attribute)

+++Example 3+++
Establishing pointer association in C for use with existing Fortran
function. This also illustrates non-interoperable function results.

module mod_ptr
  use, intrinsic :: iso_c_binding ! extended by TR29113
contains
  function column_op(matrix, icol) BIND(C)
    real(c_float), pointer :: matrix(:,:)
    real(c_float), pointer :: column_op(:)
    integer(c_int) :: icol
    if (icol >= lbound(matrix,2) .and. icol <= ubound(matrix,2)) then
       column_op => matrix(:,icol)
!      do something with column in-place
       :
    else
       column_op => null()
    end if
  end function column
end module mod_ptr

Here the client code:

#include <ISO_Fortran_binding.h>

CFI_f_obj *column_op(CFI_f_obj *inp, int *icol);

int process_col(float *mat, int ncol, int icol, int stride) {
  /* pointer *mat with ncol*ncol entries is handed in */
  CFI_f_obj *f_col;
  CFI_f_obj f_mat;
  CFI_shape fshape[2];
  int stat;

  fshape[1].lbound = 1;
  fshape[1].ubound = ncol;
  fshape[1].stride = stride;
  fshape[0].lbound = 1;
  fshape[0].ubound = ncol;
  fshape[0].stride = 1;

  stat = CFI_c_f_obj(mat, fshape, 2, sizeof(float), \
                     CFI_attribute_pointer, &f_mat);

  if (stat == CFI_status_success) {
    f_col = column_op(&f_mat, icol+1);
  } else {
    /* error */
  }

  /* can now hand on Fortran pointer f_col to Fortran, or
     unpack CFI_f_c_pointer, receiving a 1-dimensional
     strided array for use in C */

  free(f_col);
}
+++End of Example 3+++



IV. Remarks on assumed type entities:
-------------------------------------

For assumed type (TYPE(*)) dummy arguments with the ALLOCATABLE or
POINTER attributes, or having assumed-shape or assumed-rank, a mapped
interface will be created. Thereby potential disambiguation problems
are avoided.
However, if an entity of non-interoperable type (intrinsic or not)
is handed over to an assumed type dummy which does not have one of
the above attributes, this will still be directly mapped to a
C-interoperable pointer to void; the programmer may then use this
pointer as a handle; referencing or defining the data pointed at by
the pointer inside C may or may not be possible.

COMMENT: Since the above appears to introduce a greater type unsafety
  than is already present on the level of C, I'd suggest adding
  the following restrictions:
  "If a dummy argument of TYPE(*) appears in a BIND(C) interface and
   is a scalar without the POINTER or ALLOCATABLE attributes, or is
   an explicit-size or assumed-shape array, the actual argument must
   be of interoperable type. If the actual argument itself is of
   TYPE(*), it must itself be a dummy argument in a BIND(C) interface."



+++Example 4+++
Compatibility MPI calls for sending and receiving data, implemented
as C wrappers. This is a sensible strategy since conversion of Fortran
INTEGER entities to C derived type objects is required. The Fortran
interface is

module mpi
  use, intrinsic :: iso_c_binding ! extended by TR29113
  implicit none
  interface
    subroutine mpi_send(buf, count, datatype, dest, tag,
               &        comm, ierror) BIND(C, NAME='MPIF_Send')
      type(*), dimension(..), intent(in), contiguous :: buf
      integer(c_int), intent(in) :: count, datatype, dest, tag, &
               comm, ierror
    end subroutine
    subroutine mpi_recv(buf, count, datatype, source, tag,
               &        comm, status, ierror) BIND(C, NAME='MPIF_Recv')
    type(*), dimension(..), intent(out), contiguous :: buf
    integer(c_int), intent(in) :: count, datatype, dest, tag, &
               comm, ierror
    integer(c_int), intent(out) :: status(MPI_STATUS_SIZE)
  end interface
end module

Since the buf argument is of assumed rank, a mapped interface is
created (case 2 above). The C implementation might read

This provides nearly full backward compatibility to the previously
used MPI Fortran interface. The only exception is that no whole
assumed size actual arguments can be provided as MPI buffers (remember
DIMENSION(**) was disliked by J3). For this particular call,
even non-interoperable intrinsic types could be supported; however e.g.,
MPI_Reduce is more challenging with respect to non-interoperable types.


V. OPTIONAL and VALUE arguments:
--------------------------------

If one of the arguments has the OPTIONAL attribute, it is
replaced by a NULL value in the C interface, provided the VALUE
attribute is not also specified for entities which are not
of type c_ptr or non-interoperable (for non-interoperable entities,
a pointer argument is always created). This rule holds whether the
Fortran interface is interoperable or not.

For a non-interoperable argument with the VALUE attribute, the
Fortran object will point to the temporary copy generated by a
Fortran implementation (Case 1), or the Fortran wrapper must
generate such a copy before passing it on to the C implementation
(Case 2).

If both the OPTIONAL and the VALUE attribute are specified for any
interoperable entity not of type c_ptr, the difficulty appears to
be on the C side, since this combination is not really supported
there. Hence, in this case it is necessary to create a mapped
interface with the following properties with respect to the dummy
argument in question:

Case 1: implementation in Fortran

The argument in the C wrapper will be a pointer entity, and
value semantics will be enforced via execution of the Fortran
procedure which will generate a temporary copy of the entity. If
NULL is provided as an actual argument in a call from the companion
processor, the argument will be regarded as not PRESENT in Fortran.


Case 2: implementation through a companion processor

The implementation must use a pointer entity. When called from Fortran,
the wrapper must generate a copy of the argument and hand a reference
to this on to the C routine, unless the argument is not present, in
which case NULL is handed on. After execution of the C routine the
copy, if one exists, is destroyed again.


+++Example 5+++
Treatment of optional arguments

module mod_optional
  use, intrinsic :: iso_c_binding ! extended by TR29113
  implicit none
contains
  subroutine foo_opt(x, n) BIND(C)
    real(c_float), optional :: x(:)
    integer(c_int), optional, value :: n
    :  ! check for presence of x and n and do work
  end subroutine foo_opt
end module

Usage on the client:

#include <ISO_Fortran_binding.h>

void foo_opt(CFI_f_obj *x, int *n);

int main() {
  CFI_f_obj fx;
  int n, stat;
  CFI_shape fshape[1];
  int rank;
  n = 3;
  fshape[0].lbound = 1;
  fshape[0].lbound = 4; /* array of size 4 */
  fshape[0].stride = 1;
  stat = CFI_allocate(&fx, fshape, 1, sizeof(float), \
                      CFI_attribute_allocatable);
  if (stat == CFI_status_success) {
    foo_opt(&fx, NULL);  /* n is not present */
    foo_opt(NULL, &n);   /* x is not present, copy of n is produced,
                            so changes inside foo_opt will not
                            modify C-local n */
  }
  stat = CFI_deallocate(&fx);
}
