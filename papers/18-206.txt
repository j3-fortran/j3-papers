Subject: Argument DIM of THIS_IMAGE

References: 18-168 (item GB082)

Ballot Comment
~~~~~~~~~~
Fortran 2018 has dropped the requirement that the DIM argument to
THIS_IMAGE be of default kind. But this change is not mentioned in the
list of changes in the Introduction.

Discussion
~~~~~~~
This comment is already covered by the following sentence appearing in
the bullet headed "Intrinsic procedures and modules" in the Introduction,
"Integer and logical arguments to intrinsic procedures and intrinsic
module procedures that were previously required to be of default kind
no longer have that requirement, except for RANDOM_SEED. ".

Since this is already covered, JoR recommends that no edits are required.
