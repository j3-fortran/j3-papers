1. Discussion
==============

The description of event state changes is updated to match that of the
atomic subroutines.

2. Edits with respect to N2007
===============================

[15:9-10] Replace "The effect of each change ... change" with
"The effect of each change is as if the atomic subroutine
 ATOMIC_ADD were executed with a variable storing the
 event count as its ATOM argument."
