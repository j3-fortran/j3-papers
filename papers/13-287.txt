Subject: Misc collective fixes


Discussion:
-----------

Edits are needed in TS subclause 7.2 Collective subroutines to better
specify the STAT argument requirements and semantics.


Edits to N1967:
---------------

[15:14] Replace "calls to" by "invocations of".

[15:19] At the end of 7.2p3 add a sentence:

"If the STAT argument is present in the call on one image it shall be
present on the corresponding calls on all of the images of the present
team."

[15:32] A the end of  7.2p5 add a sentence:

"If a condition occurs that would assign a nonzero value to a STAT
argument but the STAT argument is not present, error termination is
initiated."
