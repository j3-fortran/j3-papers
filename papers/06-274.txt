Comments that I believe are merely editorial and have no
technical impact or merit. Editorial comments on MACROS are
in the macro paper, not this one.

General edit questions

1) Is there a way to add the defining rule number in the
BNF for things that are far away. For example
R448 component-initialization is initialization-expr
and initialization-expr is defined way off in C 7.

2) In some/many cases Rules do not have a blank line
between them, whereas constraints always seem to. Makes
it hard to read the rules when they are close together.
See, e.g., [120:13-22]


Specific edits

XV The laundry list needs to be redone at a later time. I
suggest going down the list of things in spread sheet
and having a big feature and a little feature list.

[1:12] Add after "length" "; part 2 has been largely
subsumed by allocatable characters."

[2:40] (16) isn't a good reference for scoping unit

[3:15] This seems to say the new .XOR. has a different
precedence from what it had before. It didn't have
one before.

[6:2] Clause 4 has constraints with 3 digits. Probably
easiest to delete a few of the unneeded ones.

[12:7] To my eye on my printer, this line looks like it has
a smaller font than the others.

[12:16] Change "are to be" to "may be". Also in [13:25].
The current wording sounds like they must be
available, but availability is controlled by a USE
statement.

[13:34] "the ancestor" implies to me the immediate unique
ancestor. Can't it be declared in any ancestor?

[15:13] change "a procedure" to "a Fortran procedure". Whom
knows where a companion processor starts doing
anything.

[22:21] There are two instances of "may be accessed". The
first is really a requirement, the second is mostly
expressing an option. Replace the first clause to
refer only to co-array elements on other images and
say "may only" and use some form of "may or may
not" on its own image.

[41:22] Delete the phrase "is considered to be" which
implies that it's a matter of opinion.
Can we order the editor to search for all instances
of "considered" and make a similar deletion?

[42:note 4.1] Delete the phrases "by design" and "are
designed to be" because they imply doubt. "Cars
are designed to be safe"

[44:1] Add a forward reference for extensible type

[44:30] Add a note explaining that if A is type compatible
with B, that doesn't imply that B is TC with A.
Give an example

[53:3] The processor only defines the collating sequence
for some character sets. ISO_10646 and ASCII are
well defined. The default character set sequence is
partially defined.
This also (possibly) affects [52:22-23] and the text
that should be moved here from [25:16-21]

[53:note 4.14] My Japanese is a little rusty, does this
translate to "always buy the NAG compiler"?

[54:26] Delete this line. It's the only sub header under
bits and none of the other types have one like
this.

[54:28-29] Bold font "kind" and "representation method".
All of the other types have theirs bolded.

[54:32] For bits, it would be user friendly to add a note
saying that they use "kind" more like the character
length parameter and people shouldn't get confused.
Particularly because the standard is weak at
keeping separate the distinction for characters.
I'm sure I've seen things like "ASCII type".

[61:note 4.27] I'd expand on the explanation by saying that
length type parameters don't participate in generic
resolution, only the KIND ones do. And that a KIND
parameter can (also) be used as in a length-like
way, but not vice-versa.

[64:note 4.34] Adding a line like
PROCEDURE, POINTER :: SPELL_CHECKER => NULL()
and some text would help.


[57:6] Add a forward reference for extensible type

[65:27] Need "and" before "does not".

[115:9] Delete "The"

[115:12] Delete "A"

[126:16] Add "but its parameters must be defined" or
whatever.

[131:note 6.31] In the penultimate line add "if it was
allocated" before the full stop.

[330:7-12] Could we change "separate" to "sep" or vice
versa in the linked bnf terms?
