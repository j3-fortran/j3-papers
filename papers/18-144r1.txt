Subject: POINTER dummy arguments, INTENT, and target modification

Introduction:
-------------

When Fortran first introduced dummy arguments with the POINTER
attribute, INTENT for such arguments was disallowed due to an
intrinsic ambiguity.  Namely, whether the intent would refer to the
pointer association status or to the modifications of its target.
Subsequently the standard has introduced INTENT for pointer dummy
arguments where the implications are for the pointer association.

There are many situations in which it would be desirable to express
whether the target of a pointer dummy argument can be modified through
that pointer.


Intent:
-------

Introduce a mechanism whereby a procedure dummy argument with the
POINTER attribute can have an attribute that specifies whether its
target can be modified through the pointer.

No specific syntax is suggested in this paper.
