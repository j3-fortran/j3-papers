Discussion:

Japan comment 21 notes that the second sentence of the second
paragraph of Note 11.39

" In the following example, image 1 will wait for each of the other
images to complete its use of the data. "

is technically incorrect and misleading.  The "use of data" is not
material here, but rather that the other images execute their SYNC
IMAGES(1) statement.  An edit is supplied to change this.

Additionally, Japan comment 22 notes a typo in the same Note where
"iNUM_IMAGES()" should be "NUM_IMAGES()".  An edit is supplied to
change this.
