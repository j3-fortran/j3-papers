Subject:   Unresolved issues 218, 219, 238

Unresolved issue 218, page 400, asks whether a BIND(C) global variable
must be defined by C or whether it can be defined by Fortran.
It also asks for clarification of the linkage between the C variable
and the Fortran variable. Finally, it asks for rewording of shall
vs. may in Section 16.2.7 .

Unresolved issue 219, page 401, talks about needing details about
changes to the C variable affect the Fortran variable, and vice versa.

Unresolved issue 238, p. 67, asks if we should remove the prohibition
that BIND(C) variables cannot be initialized. Note that a similar
constraint occurs on p. 85 (discussing the DATA statement).

Subgroup believes that a global variable with the BIND(C) attribute
should cause that variable to exist if there is no C definition of the
variable. There are several cases:

C program		Fortran program		Fortran status
---------------   -----------------       -------------------
no definition	no initialization		initially undefined
no definition	initialization		initially defined
definition		no initialization		initially undefined
definition		initialization		illegal
initialization	no initialization		initially defined
initialization	initialization		illegal

The above table resolves the issue of ownership of a BIND variable, and
of whether or not Fortran should allow the variable to be initialized.
There is still the issue of how modifications to the C variable affect
the Fortran variable. The concept of linkage association is introduced
to resolve this issue.

Edits:

These edits remove the prohibition that Fortran may not
define an initial value for a BIND object.

[67:1-2] Delete "an object with the BIND attribute, an object in a named
COMMON block that has the BIND attribute,"

[67:3-8] Delete unresolved issue 238

[85:29-30] Delete "an object with the BIND attribute,
an object in a named COMMON block that has the BIND attribute,"

These edits add the concept of linkage association:
[353:17] Substitute "five" for "four"
[353:18] Substitute "linkage association and construct" for
"and construct"
[360:33+] Add a section
14.6.5 Linkage association
Linkage association occurs between a module variable that
has the BIND attribute and the C variable with which
it interoperates, or between a Fortran common
block and the C variable with which it interoperates
(16.2.7). Such an association remains in effect throughout
the execution of the program.

These edits add a new means for a variable to become initially
defined:
[361:14] Delete "and"
[361:15] substitute "and" for "."
[361:15+] Add a new bullet item:
(5) Variables with the BIND attribute that are initialized by means
other than Fortran.
[361:15+] Add a note:
Note 14.x
Fortran code:
module mod
	integer, bind(c,name="blivet") :: foo
end module mod

C code:
int blivet = 123;

In the above example, the Fortran variable foo is initially defined to
the value 123 by means other than Fortran.
*** END Note 14.x ***

These edits resolve the issues about who "owns" a BIND variable.


[400:35-44] Delete unresolved issue 218

[400:32] Change "shall be" to "is"

[400:34+] Add the sentences:
There does not have to be an associated C entity for a Fortran
entity with the BIND attribute.

[400:34+] Add the sentence:
A variable shall not be initially defined by more than one processor.

[401:35-40] Delete unresolved issue 219.
