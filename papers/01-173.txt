Subject: Derived Type I/O Fixups

The description of how to expand list items into effective list items,
or just expand a list item as if the user had specified ...., is broken
and/or incompletely specified, and/or specifies undesirable behavior,
including a situation parallel to the existing F95 interp about intrinsic
assignment overriding user defined assignment for components of derived
type. We now expand all derived type list items unless the list item is
processed by a u.d.d.t.i.o. routine, or is an unformatted i/o list item,
and none of the components/sub-components/sub-sub-components/... of that
list item are processable by a u.d.d.t.i.o. routine.  Note that namelist
items are expanded in this way, even though there are no list items on the
I/O statement [229:1-3].  Note that effective list items now apply to both
formatted and unformatted i/o lists.  Note that polymorphic components are
either allocatable or pointers; therefore, restrictions on ultimate
components not being allocatable or pointer exclude polymorphic objects.

Edits:
[182:6+] add
"A list item shall not be polymorphic, unless it is processed by a
user-defined derived-type input/output procedure (9.5.4.4.3)."

[182:8+] add
"The rules describing when to expand an input/output list item are
re-applied to each expanded list item until none of the rules apply."

[182:20+] add:
"If a list item of derived type in an unformatted input/output statement
is not processed by a user-defined derived-type input/output procedure
(9.5.4.4.3), and if any sub-object of that list item would be processed by
a user-defined derived-type input/output procedure, the list item is treated
as if all of the components of the object were specified in component order
(4.5.4); those components shall be accessible in the scoping unit containing
the input/output statement, shall not be pointers nor allocatables.

If a list item of derived type in a formatted input/output statement
is not processed by a user-defined derived-type input/output procedure
(9.5.4.4.3), that list item is treated as if all of the components of
the list item were specified in component order (4.5.4); those components
shall be accessible in the scoping unit containing the input/output
statement, and shall not be pointers nor allocatables.

If a derived-type list item is not treated as a list of its
individual components, that list item's ultimate components shall not
be pointers nor allocatables, unless that object is processed
by a user-defined derived-type input/output procedure (9.5.4.4.3)."

Delete [182:21-33].

[182:43] Insert "effective" before "input/output list item".
