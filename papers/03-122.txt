Subject: Edits for UK comment TC2 (Respecification at type extension)
Date: 11 February 2003

Comment TC2 of the UK vote was:

  Remove the option of re-specifying the accessibility and default
  initial value for the parent component when a type is extended.

  This complicates the language with little benefit.

Here are the edits for this:

42:1-2. Replace by
           <<or>> EXTENDS ( <parent-type-name> )

46:11-12. Delete "An <initialization-expr> in the EXTENDS
<type-attr-spec> is for the parent component (4.5.3.1)."

50:29. Change "of a type"
        to "that are declared in a type's <data-component-part>".

[The present text will need correcting even if TC2 is not accepted
since it is wrong for inherited components.]
