Subject: short-circuiting logical operators
Date: 2018-February-15


Introduction
------------

Logical operators for .and. and .or. that do not evaluate
their right operand unless the left operand value requires
right operand value to compute the value of the expression,
have been requested previously but never made the cut.
Perhaps now is the right time to reconsider them.

Specifically, a logical expression such as

i <= n .and. a(i) > 0.0

where n is the upper bound of a, appears frequently
in codes.  But there is no guarantee that a(i) will be
fetched only after i is known to be in bounds.  The obvious
repair, of nesting the second condition, is unpopular,
at least among some applications programmers.  Even when
no use is made of a(i) beyond evaluating its (undefined)
value in the expression, it may trigger a bounds warning.
Being in-bounds, of course, is exactly why the i <= n
appears to the left.

Thus, an .andthen. operator that makes such a guarantee
would be useful.  By analogy, an .orelse. operator that makes
the same guarantee regarding the right operand would
also be desirable.


Feature
-------

Standardize logical operators .andthen. and .orelse.

.andthen. has the same truth table as .and.
but guarantees that its right operand is not evaluated
when the left operand is false (and thus the expression value
is known to be false without the right operand value).

.orelse. has the same truth table as .or.
but guarantees that its right operand is not evaluated
when the left operand is true (and thus the expression
value is known to be true without the right operand value).

They should have the lowest precedence, after user-defined
binary operators.
