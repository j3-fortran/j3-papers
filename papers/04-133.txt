Subject: Better Description of Memory- SWAP


Processor speeds have increased to very much faster rates
than memory speeds, compilers have improved to the point
where most code sequences are nearly perfectly optimized.
Separate compilation confounds "application compilers",
pointers and targets complicate aliasing analysis.
Therefore, more information regarding aliasing is essential
for very high computational rates.  The "Better Description
of Memory" features attempt to define features which may
provide this missing information to compilers.  Since several
features combine to do so, they are broken into individual
papers for consideration.

Title: Better Description of Memory- SWAP

Submitted By: J3

Status: For Consideration

Basic Functionality: Reduce copying by defining an atomic swap
                     statement.

Rationale:  Compilers must generate copy operations user-defined
            swap operations are encoded.  Sometimes, a compiler
            will be able to do no better, but there are other cases
            where a compiler can do very much better indeed.

Estimated Impact: Compilers must recognize a new statement,
                  and generate code for it.

Detailed Specification: Introduce a SWAP statement, as follows:

                        SWAP( A, B)

                        Where a SWAP statement appears, both the following
                        must be allowed:

                        A = B
                        B = A

                        without implying a type conversion.

                        Example:

                        real, allocatable, dimension(:) :: x, y
                        allocate( x( 1000000))
                        allocate( y( 1000000))

                        swap( x, y)

                        Note that the compier can simply swap
                        the data structures for x, y, rather than
                        copying 2e6 words.
