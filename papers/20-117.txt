NUMBER: F18/0017
TITLE: Final subroutine invocation order
KEYWORDS: FINAL ALLOCATABLE
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider

  Module m
    Type base
    Contains
      Final basef
    End Type
    Type other
    Contains
      Final otherf
    End Type
    Type,Extends(base) :: t
      Type(other),Allocatable :: comp
    Contains
      Final tf
    End Type
  Contains
    Subroutine basef(a)
      Type(base),Intent(InOut) :: a
      Print *,'basef'
    End Subroutine
    Subroutine otherf(b)
      Type(other),Intent(InOut) :: b
      Print *,'otherf'
    End Subroutine
    Subroutine tf(c)
      Type(t),Intent(InOut) :: c
      Print *,'tf'
    End Subroutine
  End Module
  Program test
    Use m
    Call sub
  Contains
    Subroutine sub
      Type(t) x
      Allocate(x%comp)
    End Subroutine
  End Program

When the subroutine is executed, it will finalize X on exit,
so what is the expected output?

Finalization of X occurs before auto-deallocation of X%COMP;
this follows from 9.7.3.2 paragraph 9.

According to 7.5.6.2, in sequence
  (1) the object's final procedure is invoked, i.e. TF is called,
  (2) finalizable components are finalized, i.e. OTHERF is called,
  (3) the parent is finalized, i.e. BASEF is called.
And according to 7.5.6.3, deallocating X%COMP finalizes it,
and so
  (4) OTHERF is called.
I.e. the output is
  TF
  OTHERF
  BASEF
  OTHERF

However, this violates the principle that you only finalize something
once.

Q1. Is X%COMP actually finalized twice?

It could be argued that "finalizing X before deallocating X%COMP"
only puts an order on invocation of TF, and in particular, finalizing
the parent pseudo-component need not precede the deallocation. But
this would still invoke OTHERF twice.

Q3. Is the auto-deallocation of an allocatable component required to
    follow the finalization of other components and the parent
    pseudo-component?

Now consider the case where X%COMP is not allocated (i.e. delete the
ALLOCATE statement). According to 7.5.6.2, it should invoke
  (1) TF on X
  (2) OTHERF on X%COMP
  (3) BASEF on X%BASE
however, as X%COMP is unallocated, the invocation in step (2) does
not conform to the procedure reference requirements, i.e. the program
is not conforming.

Q2. Is X%COMP required to be allocated when X is finalized?

DISCUSSION:

An object is only finalized in situations listed in 7.5.6.3.
Every such situation would also unconditionally deallocate any
allocatable component, and if that component were finalizable,
such deallocation would also unconditionally finalize the
component (* except for intrinsic assignment, where a previous
interpretation added an exclusion).

Therefore it seems to be broken to finalize any allocatable component
during finalization of the object it is contained in, as either it
will be non-conforming, or will be finalized twice (* except for the
previously-added exception).

The design where allocatable entities are finalized at the time of
deallocation would seem to be simpler, easier to understand, and less
buggy.

Perhaps the finalization of allocatable components in 7.5.6.2 step
(2) should be removed, and the exclusion for intrinsic assignment for
deallocation-finalization should also be removed?

ANSWER:

A1. No object should be finalized twice.
A2. No, a finalizable allocatable component should not be required to
    be allocated when its containing object is finalized.

The inclusion of allocatable components in 7.5.6.2 step (2) is an
error in the standard, and the intrinsic assignment exception for
finalization on deallocation is likewise an error.

Edits are provided to correct these errors.

A3. An allocatable component should be able to be finalized as soon
    as the object's final subroutine returns, i.e. there should be no
    requirement on the processor to produce a particular invocation
    order here.

The ambiguity in whether component deallocation and component
finalization should be ordered is inadvertent. An edit is provided
to remove any implication that these need to have a specific order.

EDITS to 18-007r1:

[80:9] 7.5.6.2 The finalization process, p1, item (2),
       "All finalizable" -> "All nonallocatable finalizable".
{Remove redundant finalization.}

[80:22] 7.5.6.3 When finalization occurs, p2,
    After
      "unless it is the variable in an intrinsic assignment statement"
    Delete "or a subobject thereof".
{Remove allocatable component exclusion in intrinsic assignment.}

[137:28] 9.7.3.2 Deallocation of allocatable variables, p9,
  Change "that object is finalized"
  To     "any final subroutine for that object is executed",
  Making the whole paragraph read
    "If an allocatable component is a subobject of a finalizable
     object, any final subroutine for that object is executed before
     the component is automatically deallocated."
