1. Introduction:

Paper 19-142r1 proposed syntax for new TYPEOF and CLASSOF statements.
This paper proposes edits.


2. Edits:


[xiii Introduction] Replace entirety of paragraph 2 with:

"This revision of the Fortran language contains several extensions to
Fortran 2018; these are listed below.

<bullet> Data declaration: TYPEOF and CLASSOF type specifiers can be
  used to declare one or more entities to have the same type and type
  parameters as another entity;
"


[55:19+ 7.3.2 Type specifiers and type compatibility] Append two lines
to <declaration-type-spec> list:

"
      <<or>>  TYPEOF(<data-ref>)
      <<or>>  CLASSOF(<data-ref>)
"


[55:27+ 7.3.2 Type specifiers and type compatibility] Insert

"

The TYPEOF type-specifier declares nonpolymorphic entities whose
declared type and type parameters are the same as <data-ref>.  Type
parameters that are deferred in <data-ref> are deferred in the
entities being declared.

The CLASSOF type-specifier declares polymorphic entities whose
declared type and type parameters are the same as <data-ref>.  Type
parameters that are deferred in <data-ref> are deferred in the entities
being declared.

C708a A <declaration-type-spec> that is a TYPEOF or CLASSOF specifier
      shall appear only in a type declaration statement or component
      definition statement.

C708b The <data-ref> in a <declaration-type-spec> that is a
      TYPEOF or CLASSOF specifier shall have its type and type
      parameters previously declared or established by the implicit
      typing rules.

C708c The <data-ref> in a <declaration-type-spec> that is a
      TYPEOF specifier shall not be unlimited polymorphic or
      of abstract type.

C708d The <data-ref> in a <declaration-type-spec> that is a CLASSOF
      specifier shall not be of assumed type or intrinsic type.

"


[93 8.2 Type declaration statement] In Note 1 (cont'd), after the line
declaring "K" insert the line

"
TYPEOF(K) :: K_TMP ! also has range at least -9999 to 9999.
"

[93 8.2 Type declaration statement] In Note 1 (cont'd), after the line
declaring "MAT" insert the line

"
   CLASSOF(MAT), POINTER :: MAT_REF ! same declared type and
                                    ! type parameters as MAT
"
{ Note:  the comments above are meant to be on the same line, but exceeded
  the line length for the paper upload.}
