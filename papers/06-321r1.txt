Subject: Issue 63, FORM_TEAM synchronization
Reference: J3/06-007r1, J3/06-266

Discussion of issue 63 (page 380)

FORM_TEAM differs from collective routines in that the team of
images is an INTENT(OUT) argument and therefore does not exist at the
start (thus the words [339:16-17] do not apply to it). It is therefore
better to remove it from the list of collective routines (13.5.15) and
simply make it an intrinsic subroutine that involves synchronization.

Edit to J3/06-007r1

[14:12-14] Replace this paragraph with:
"A <<team>> is a set of images identified by an object of type
IMAGE_TEAM (13.8.3.7)."

[339:15] Add new sentences after the first sentence:
"The collective subroutines accept an optional argument TEAM
that identifies a team. If the TEAM argument is not present, the team
consists of all images."

[380:2] Change the class to just "Subroutine"

[380:6-] Add a new paragraph:
"If FORM_TEAM is invoked by one image of a team, it shall be invoked by
the same statement on all images of the team. There is an implicit team
synchronization (8.5.3) after the team is formed."
