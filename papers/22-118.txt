Subject: C_F_POINTER's SHAPE argument should be described as upper bounds
Date: 2022-February-03
Reference: 22-007

Before adding the LOWER argument to C_F_POINTER, the description of the
SHAPE argument argument as specifying the shape of the result was
harmless. If a LOWER argument is present, describing the SHAPE argument as
specifying the shape instead of the upper bounds is confusing, and
incompatible with pointer assignment.

Assume X is contiguous and has the POINTER or TARGET attribute. Assume F
is a pointer. Assume L and U are rank-1 arrays whose extents are equal to
the rank of F, and whose values are the desired lower and upper bounds of
F, respectively.

Then

    F(@L:U) => X

specifies those bounds.

Assume C is of type C_PTR. Then to achieve the effect of the above,
assuming some intermediate operation by C interoperability and not all
values of L are 1 (else why bother specifing it), one would confusingly
need to write

    C = C_LOC(X)
    ... (C is passed to a C function)
    call C_F_POINTER ( C, F, U-L+1, L )

to be equivalent to

    F(@L:U) => X

It would be less confusing if the SHAPE argument were described as the
upper bound of the result, allowing

    C => C_LOC(X)
    ... (C is passed to a C function)
    call C_F_POINTER ( C, F, U, L )

to be equivalent to

    F(@L:U) => X

This description is not incompatible with Fortran 2018.

When C interoperability was being developed in 1997-2003, after Michael
Hennecke's effort was rejected, it was urged that C_F_POINTER ought to
include provision to specify both lower and upper bounds, in that order,
but that proposal was rejected.
