"The default character kind shall support a character 
set that includes the Fortran character set. By supplying 
nondefault character kinds, the processor may support 
additional character sets. The characters available in 
nondefault character kinds are not specified by this 
standard, except that one character in each nondefault 
character set shall be designated as a blank character 
to be used as a padding character."

Withdrawn comments

that compiler directives make a code non-standard?
