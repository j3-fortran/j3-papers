Introduction
============

ENUM, BIND(C) was added for C interoperability.

C has enumerators because they are useful.

Pascal, Modula-2, Ada, ... have proper enumeration types, and
enumerators of those types, because they are useful.

Applications
============

Do these really need use-case code snippets and examples?

1.  Enumerators are useful to avoid
      integer, parameter :: A = 1
      integer, parameter :: B = A + 1
      integer, parameter :: C = B + 1
      etc.
    which is fragile if additional "enumerators" are required.
2.  Type-safe argument association, which ENUM, BIND(C) does not
    provide, is useful.
3.  Type-safe intrinsic assignment, which ENUM, BIND(C) does not
    provide, is useful.
4.  Generic resolution, which ENUM, BIND(C) does not provide, is useful.

Formal requirements (conflated with formal specifications)
==========================================================

1.  Enumeration types shall be provided.

2.  Enumerators are not of integer type.  They have an internal
    representation that is the same as a processor-dependent kind of
    integer.

3.  An enumeration type consists of names of enumerators.  Each name
    shall be different.  Each enumerator of an enumeration type has a
    different integer representation.  The type of each enumerator is
    the type in which it is defined to be an enumerator.

4.  Enumeration types shall be extensible.  The extension type includes
    all the enumerators of the parent type.  An enumerator of an
    extension type shall not have the same name as an enumerator of its
    parent type.

5.  The integer representation of the first enumerator of an enumeration
    type that is not an extension type is 1.  The integer representation
    of the first enumerator of an extension enumeration type is one more
    than the integer representation of the last enumerator of its parent
    type.  The integer representation of each enumerator after the first
    one is one more than the integer representation of the previous
    enumerator.

6.  Enumerators of a type are considered to be ordered, in the order
    they appear in the type definition.  [This contradicts 18-256r1, but
    if unordered the DO construct does not make sense, and a range in a
    CASE statement is impossible.]

7.  The integer representation of an enumerator may be accessed using
    the INT intrinsic function.  The KIND argument specifies the kind
    type parameter value of the result.

8.  Definition of an enumeration type defines a type constructor of the
    same name.  The argument of an enumeration type's constructor may
    be:

    8a. An integer having a value within the range of values of the
        integer representations of enumerators of the type.  Invoking
        the constructor with a value outside this range is an error
        condition.  Whether the constructor function has STAT= and
        ERRMSG= arguments can be decided in due course.  This would make
        the constructors impure.

    8b. An enumerator of the constructor's enumeration type.

9.  Different enumeration types may have enumerators that have the same
    names.  This does not imply that they have the same numeric
    representation.  If enumerators of different type, that have the
    same name, are accessible within a scoping unit, reference to them
    requires application of their enumeration type's constructor
    function.

    E.g., if the enumeration types NAMES and COLORS both have
    enumerators named GREEN that are accessible within a single scoping
    unit, they would need to be referenced as NAMES(GREEN) and
    COLORS(GREEN).

10. The <expr> in a SELECT CASE statement may be of enumeration type. 
    Enumerators may be used to specify the values of expressions in CASE
    statements.  The enumerators in the CASE statements shall be of the
    same type as the <expr> in the SELECT CASE statement.

11. Variables may be of enumeration type.  Their <initialization>, if
    any, shall be of the same type.  In a DATA statement, the
    <data-stmt-value> shall be of the same type as the <variable> or
    <data-i-do-object>.

12. Named constants may be of enumeration type.  Their <initialization>
    shall be of the same type.

13. Type components may be of enumeration type.  If they have default
    initialization, their <initialization> shall be of the same type.

14. The only intrinsic operators defined for objects of enumeration
    types are comparison operators.  If one operand of a comparison
    operator is of an enumeration type, the other shall be of the same
    type.

15. Expressions may have results of enumeration type.

16. Functions may have results of enumeration type.

17. Enumeration types are used for generic resolution.

18. Where a variable of an enumeration type appears in a
    variable-definition context, the value assigned must be within the
    range of enumerators of the type of the variable.

19. Variables of enumeration type are not polymorphic.

20. The type of an actual argument shall be the same as the type of a
    dummy argument.  Enumeration types are not an exception to this
    rule.

21. Enumeration types are considered to have connected functions that
    are referenced as if they were type-bound functions.  Maybe they
    will be called type-bound functions.  If E is a named data object of
    enumeration type:

    21a. E%INT() or E%INT(KIND=n) returns the numerical representation
         of E.
    21b. E%FIRST() returns the first enumerator of the type of E.  This
         enumerator might have been inherited from the type of its parent.
    21c. E%LAST() returns the last enumerator of the type of E.  This
         will not return an enumerator of an extension of the type or E.
    21d. E%PRED() returns the enumerator whose integer representation is
         one less than the integer representation of E.  If E is the
         first enumerator of its type (which might have been inherited
         from its parent type), an error condition occurs.
    21e. E%SUCC() returns the enumerator whose integer representation is
         one more than the integer representation of E.  If E is the
         last enumerator of its type, an error condition occurs.

22. Formatted input/output of objects of enumeration type uses '(A)'
    format.  The text produced or expected is the name of the
    enumerator.  Input is case insensitive.  Whether case of output can
    be controlled can be decided in due course.

    E.g., write ( *, '(a)' ) GREEN
          produces GREEN on standard output

          type(colors) :: MyHouse
          MyHouse = green
          write ( *, '(a)' ) MyHouse
          produces GREEN on standard output

23. Unformatted input/output uses a processor-dependent representation.

24. Accessing an enumeration type by use association provides access to
    the names of all enumerators of the type, including those inherited
    from its parent type.  Whether a mechanism is provided to access an
    enumeration type by use association without accessing its enumerator
    names can be decided in due course.  Accessing an enumerator by use
    association does not provide access to the enumerator's type's name,
    or the name of any other enumerator of the type.

25. The <do-variable> of a DO construct, <io-implied-do>, or
    <ac-do-variable> may be of an enumeration type.  If so, the first
    and second <scalar-int-expr>s shall be of that type.  If the third
    <scalar-int-expr> appears, it shall be of integer type.  If the
    ordering relationship of the first and second <scalar-int-expr>s is
    different from the sign of the third <scalar-int-expr>, the range of
    the DO is empty.  This requires changing the syntax so as not to
    require <integer-type-spec> if the <ac-do-variable> is declared
    within the constructor.

26. The <index-name> in a DO CONCURRENT construct may be of enumeration
    type.  If so, the <concurrent-limit>s shall be of the same type. 
    This requires changing the syntax so as not to require
    <integer-type-spec> if the index name is declared within the
    statement.  The <concurrent-step>, if it appears, shall be of
    integer type.  If the relationship of the ordering the first and
    second <concurrent-limit> is different from the sign of
    <concurrent-step>, the set of index values is empty.

27. Objects of enumeration type are not directly interoperable.

Suggested syntax for enumerator type definition
===============================================

  ENUMERATION [, EXTENDS(<parent-type-name>), <access-spec> ] :: &
    & <enumeration-type-name>

      ENUMERATOR :: <enumerator-name> [, <enumerator-name> ] ...
      [more ENUMERATOR statements, as necessary]
  END ENUMERATION [ <enumeration-type-name> ]

There is no ambiguity with ENUM, BIND(C).

Alternative:

  TYPE, ENUMERATION [, EXTENDS(<parent-type-name>), <access-spec> ] :: &
    & <enumeration-type-name>

      ENUMERATOR :: <enumerator-name> [, <enumerator-name> ] ...
      [more ENUMERATOR statements, as necessary]
  END TYPE [ <enumeration-type-name> ]

Suggested syntax for enumeration type object declaration
========================================================

<type-spec> is extended to allow TYPE(<enumeration-type-name>)

Questions
=========

Should the definition of an enumeration type be allowed to specify a
default initial value for variables of the type, so that they do not
spring into existence undefined?  Should it be required?

Initial straw vote whether to allow an option to specify a default
initial value was positive.

Should the underlying representation be specified to be default integer,
or left processor defined?  Does this affect extension?
