1. Introduction

Further discussions amongst generics subgroup members revealed a broad
category of use cases that appear to have important implications for
how generic programming should be implemented in Fortran.  This
category arises when a procedure manipulates two or more _distinct_
instantiations of a templated derived type and requires access to
their private components.  Here we do not imply that the derived type
itself has template parameters - it could for instance be defined
within a parameterized module.

This paper presents a specific use case in this category and concludes
with a small amount of analysis about options for supporting it.


2. Concrete use case: A map function

Posit a generic container. For the sake of illustration, let's
consider a nicely encapsulated sparse-array. One might define such a
container (with syntax purely for illustration) like the following.
(Not: quantities in angle brackets are meant to be suggestive of
template parameters.  No implication is made here about just where
such template parameters would be located in a template definition.)

module sparse_array_m
    type :: sparse_array_t<T>
        private
        type(T), allocatable :: elements(:)
        integer, allocatable :: indices(:)
    contains
        procedure :: insert_at
        procedure :: get
    end type
contains
    subroutine insert_at<T>(self, index, element)
        class(sparse_array_t<T>), intent(inout) :: self
        integer, intent(in) :: index
        type(T), intent(in) :: element

        ...
    end subroutine

    function get<T>(self, index) result(element)
        class(sparse_array_t<T>), intent(in) :: self
        integer, intent(in) :: index
        type(T) :: element

        ...
    end function
end module

A desirable operation on such a container would be to transform the
data from one instantiation to another , without changing the internal
structure.  Presumably, since the components are private, this would
be provided as a procedure in the module defining the container. It
might be implemented like the following.

function map<T, U>(transformation, xs) result(ys)
    interface
        pure function transformation_i(x) result(y)
            type(T), intent(in) :: x
            type(U) :: y
        end function
    end interface
    procedure(transformation_i) :: transformation
    type(sparse_array_t<T>), intent(in) :: xs
    type(sparse_array_t<U>) :: ys

    ys%indices = xs%indices
    ys%elements = etransformation(xs%elements)
contains
    elemental function etransformation(x) result(y)
        type(T), intent(in) :: x
        type(U) :: y

        y = transformation(x)
    end function
end function

Note that this requires two distinct instantiations of the container
type, input and output. Also, this procedure must have requires access
to the private components for each of the instantiated container
types.

3. Analysis

Our first observation is that a map template such as above cannot be
implemented by Parameterized Modules (PM) alone.  With PM, one cannot
instantiate a derived type within the same (parameterized) module as
the type definition.  The map function would need to be part of a
separate (parameterized) module, and therefore could not have access
to private components.

Option A:  Software engineering solution

The developer relaxes encapsulation either by making the components
PUBLIC, _or_ by providing additional methods (type-bound procedures)
that allow external client code to faithfully determine and faithfully
reproduce the internal structure.  The former is highly undesirable.
The latter is not terribly burdensome for the simple container here,
but could be quite involved for more complex data structures such as
trees.

Option B:  Allow templated types

If we allow for templated derived types, as suggested in the example
code, then it becomes more feasible to instantiate the type within the
same module.   This is the preferred direction of subgroup.

Option C: Allow other means to "violate" encapsulation

Here the notion is either something like C++ friend classes that have
explicit permission to violate encapsulation, or something vaguely
like submodules.  Possibly this is even a natural extension of
submodules, but subgroup has not given significant thought to this.


Straw Vote:  (Vote was 17-1-2)

1. Subgroup should not make special provision for this use case.

2. Subgroup should make reasonable attempts to iclude this use case.

3. Undecided
