Subject: EVENT_TYPE, event count, and the EVENT_QUERY subroutine
Date: 2014 May 29

1. Discussion of EVENT_TYPE
===========================

Subclause 6.2 of 14-130 states that a "processor shall support a maximum
value of the event count of at least HUGE(0)."

This implies that objects of type EVENT_TYPE have an integer component
of a kind that represents numbers at least that large.

There is no facility provided to inquire the maximum value.

Specifying the kind of the component of EVENT_TYPE that represents the
count is exactly the problem for which kind type parameters were
designed.

Rather than specifying that a "processor shall support a maximum value
of the event count of at least HUGE(0)," type EVENT_TYPE should have a
kind type parameter named KIND that specifies the kind of the component
that represents the event count.  That kind type parameter should have a
default value of KIND(0).  One could inquire the kind type parameter
value, and use the result to inquire the maximum value of the event
count, e.g., "integer, parameter :: EK = event%kind
              ... huge(0_ek)".

2. Discussion of EVENT_QUERY and event count
============================================

Querying an event count in a coindexed event variable is no different
from examining a component of an ordinary coindexed variable.  Querying
an event count in an event variable that is not coindexed is no
different from examining a component of an ordinary variable.  The
purpose of STAT and ERRMSG arguments is to detect whether one is
querying an event count on a failed image, which is certainly not the
current image.  There is no corresponding support for detecting whether
examining a component of an ordinary coindexed object is not possible
because the indexed image has failed, other than by invoking the
FAILED_IMAGES intrinsic function, which would serve equally well to
inquire whether an image having an event count of interest has failed.

Since there is no support to detect whether examining a component of an
ordinary coindexed object is not possible because the indexed image has
failed, and EVENT_QUERY consists only of examining a component of a
coindexed object (or a local object), there is no compelling reason for
EVENT_QUERY to be special.  Therefore, there is no compelling reason for
EVENT_QUERY to have STAT and ERRMSG arguments.  Therefore there is no
reason for EVENT_QUERY to be a subroutine.

There are at least three alternatives to the EVENT_QUERY subroutine.

(1) An EVENT_QUERY intrinsic function, with one argument: The event
variable.

(2) A generic type-bound function named COUNT, having a result of type
integer and the same kind as the event variable, and no arguments other
than the passed-object dummy argument.

(3) A public component of type integer with its kind specified by the
value of the kind type parameter of the event variable, and protections
to prevent tampering.

2. Edits with respect to 14-130 for EVENT_QUERY intrinsic function
==================================================================

[15:6 6.2p1] After "components" insert "and one kind type parameter
named KIND.  The default value of KIND is KIND(0)".  Delete "with no
type parameters".

[15:13 6.2p2] Replace "The processor ... HUGE(0)" with "There is an
integer component that represents the event count.  Its kind is the kind
type parameter KIND".

[23:24-24:2+2 7.4.11] Replace subclause 7.4.11

"
7.4.11 EVENT_QUERY ( EVENT )

Description. Event count.

Class.  Elemental function.

Arguments. EVENT shall be of type EVENT_TYPE with any KIND type
parameter value.

Result characteristics.  Integer.  The kind type parameter value is
EVENT%KIND.

Result value.  Number of successful event posts using EVENT minus the
number of events successfully awaited using EVENT.

Examples.  If EVENT is an event variable for which there have been no
successful event posts or waits, EVENT_QUERY ( EVENT ) has the value
zero.  After 10 successful posts to EVENT[2] and two successful waits on
EVENT[2] with UNTIL_COUNT=2, EVENT_QUERY ( EVENT[2] ) has the value 6.

NOTE 7.3
  Invoking EVENT_QUERY does not imply any synchronization.

{Is the note really necessary?}

[43:25 A.2.1] Delete "count, "

[43:40-46 A.2.1] Replace "CALL event_query ... IF ( count > 0 )..." with

"  IF ( event_query(confirm%event(i)) > 0 ) THEN ! avoid blocking if
                                                 ! processing on worker
                                                 ! is incomplete
"

{Checking the status at [43:41-45] was not replaced by
    if ( any( failed_images() == this_image() ) ) then ...
 because the statement cannot be executed if this_image() has failed!
 If we really wanted in the original to illustrate the usefulness of
 testing whether an image has failed, "confirm%event(i)" should have
 involved a coindexed "confirm" reference.
}

4. Edits with respect to 14-130 for COUNT type-bound function
=============================================================

[15:6 6.2p1] After "components" insert "and one kind type parameter
named KIND.  The default value of KIND is KIND(0)".  Delete "with no
type parameters".

[15:13 6.2p2] Replace "The processor ... HUGE(0)" with "There is an
integer component that represents the event count.  Its kind is the kind
type parameter KIND".

[15:24+ C603+] Insert a paragraph

"
EVENT_TYPE has a pure elemental non-overridable type-bound generic
function named COUNT that has no arguments other than the passed-object
dummy argument.  The result type is integer.  The result kind is the
same as the KIND type parameter.  The result value is the number of
successful event posts for the passed object minus the number of events
successfully awaited for the passed object.

NOTE 6.0
  Invoking the COUNT type-bound function does not imply any
  synchronization.

{Replace this with
"  IF ( confirm%event(i)%count > 0 ) THEN ! avoid blocking if processing
                                          ! on worker is incomplete
"
if 14-145r1 passes.}

5. Edits with respect to 14-130 for COUNT component
===================================================

[15:6 6.2p1] Before "private" insert "a public component named COUNT; it
may have additional".  After "components" insert "and one kind type
parameter named KIND.  The default value of KIND is KIND(0)".  Delete
"with no type parameters".

[15:8] Replace "An event variable has a count that" by "The COUNT
component of an event variable"

[15:9-10] Replace "The effect of each change ... change" with "The COUNT
component of an event variable is updated as if by invoking the
ATOMIC_ADD intrinsic subroutine".

[15:12] Replace "event count" with "COUNT component".

[15:13 6.2p2] Delete "The processor ... HUGE(0)."

[15:24+ C603+] Insert a paragraph

"
The COUNT component of EVENT_TYPE is an integer scalar.  Its kind is
specified by the KIND type parameter of the type.  It has no additional
attributes.  It is not definable other than by executing EVENT POST or
EVENT WAIT statements.  The value of the COUNT component of an object of
EVENT_TYPE is the number of successful posts using the object minus the
number of events successfully awaited using the object.

C603a The COUNT component of an object of type EVENT_TYPE shall not
      appear
      -- in a variable definition context (16.6.7),
      -- as an actual argument corresponding to a dummy argument that
         does not explicitly have INTENT(IN),
      -- as the <data-target> in a pointer assignment statement,
      -- as the <expr> corresponding to a component with the POINTER
         attribute in a <structure-constructor>,
      -- as an actual argument corresponding to a dummy argument with
         the POINTER attribute, or
      -- as an actual argument in a reference to the C_LOC function from
         the ISO_C_BINDING intrinsic module.

[15:30,31 6.3] Replace "count" with "COUNT component" twice.

[16:12,13 6.4] Replace "event count" with "COUNT component of the event
variable" twice.

[17:5 7.1p1] Delete "EVENT_QUERY,".
