PROPOSAL 1: Add collective procedures

Needs
It is important to be able to perform simple operations across
images efficiently. The most important example is to sum coarrays
across images. If built into the processor, advantage of its topology
can be obtained without special user coding. As well as support for a
small number of standard operations, there should be support for
user-defined operations.

Suggestions
1. A set is proposed in N1858, but they are based on replication of
transformational intrinsics of Fortran 2008, rather than real needs
and do not include support for user-defined operations.

2. In N1835, Bill Long suggests the five collective subroutines
CO_BCAST, CO_MAX, CO_MIN, CO_REDUCE, CO_SUM. They are not image control
statements (the user is responsible for synchronization).

3. In N1883, the Rice group propose additional collectives and suggest
that each of the collectives of MPI should be reviewed. They suggest
the addition of asynchronous variants of the collectives using event
notification; these versions would differ from the synchronous versions
only by the addition of a completion event parameter.

Conclusion
A small set similar to Bill Long's should be adopted.

PROPOSAL 2: Add teams

Needs
For efficient execution on a large collection of images, it may be
necessary to subdivide the images into teams that execute independently.
It is important, for example, that libraries are able to execute
collective operations and to synchronize across subsets of images
without delaying uninvolved images. Similarly, allocation of coarray
data (or other resources) on uninvolved images serves only to aggravate
the memory footprint on these images.

Additionally, teams are also convenient to organize code for working
on sub-problems such as for linear algebra applications. It is
important that code does not need to be rewritten to run on a team.

Suggestions
1. N1858 contains a detailed proposal using teams based on lists of
image indices. It requires code to be rewritten to run on a team.

2. The Rice group (N1883) suggest the use of a WITH TEAM construct to
avoid the need for code to be rewritten. Within the construct, image
indices are interpreted as positions in the team. They highlight the
importance of a TEAM_SPLIT command for subdividing a team. They suggest
adding an object TEAM_DEFAULT of type IMAGE_TEAM whose team consists
of the closest enclosing WITH TEAM block, or TEAM_WORLD if there is
none. It is important that each coarray access be able to be specified
as relative to a particular team; the WITH TEAM construct is simply
syntactic sugar surrounding this functionality.

3. Robert Numrich (N1883) suggests the complete removal of teams.

4. The Rice group (N1883) suggest adding a constant TEAM_WORLD of
type IMAGE_TEAM whose team consists of all images.

5. The Rice group (N1883) suggest adding a TEAM_RANK intrinsic that
returns the zero-based logical index of an image within a team. They
additionally suggest extending NUM_IMAGES to accept an argument of
type IMAGE_TEAM as a mechanism for determining the cardinality of a
team. 

6. Reinhold Bader (proposal 6 in N1835) discusses several aspects of
the WITH TEAM construct. If no extension of the handling of coarrays 
to teams is adopted, he asks for teams to support reductions on
subsets and efficient parallel I/O.

Conclusion
Investigate the WITH TEAM construct. Write a paper with examples of 
the use of teams.

........................................................................


PROPOSAL 3: Add NOTIFY/QUERY synchronization

Needs
NOTIFY/QUERY will permit more efficient execution by allowing an
image to perform independent actions while waiting for data from
another image.

Suggestions
1. N1858 contains a detailed proposal.

2. In N1883, the Rice group highlight the danger of a QUERY statement
becoming associated with the wrong NOTIFY statement, for example, when
code that uses the feature calls a library code that also uses it.
Their suggestion is to add an event type, objects of which type may be
used to identify NOTIFY/QUERY associations.

3. In N1835, Reinhold Bader made several suggestions for improvements.

4. In N1883, Uwe Kuester suggests using a different keyword for the
blocking QUERY since it is so different from the non-blocking QUERY.

5. The Rice group suggests that NOTIFY and QUERY be renamed with a common
prefix so that they appear together lexically in the standard and in
references based on it.

Conclusion
Develop NOTIFY/QUERY with changes to avoid explicit use of image 
indices, using the ideas of the Rice group, Reinhold Bader, and Uwe 
Kuester. Include the addition of an event type.

........................................................................

PROPOSAL 4: Add features for parallel I/O

Needs
In a parallel program, I/O is sometimes needed for data that is
distributed across images.

Suggestions
In N1858, it is suggested that direct-access files be used. 

Conclusion
Keep the N1858 feature up-to-date with team ideas.

........................................................................

PROPOSAL 5: Add global pointers

Needs
Global pointers are needed to support distributed linked data structures
and other references to remote data.

Suggestions
1. In N1883, the Rice group suggested adding copointers with a given
rank and corank. When referencing a remote object via a copointer, this
is made apparent by the notation [], e.g.
     p8(6)[] = 42
assigns element 6 of the target remote coarray.

2. In N1835, Reinhold Bader suggests adding coscalars. A coscalar
exists on a single image and is referenced on any image with
the empty cosubscript []. It may have the pointer attribute. A
structure on one image may have a component that is a coscalar
pointer with its target on another image. For details, see
N1835.

3. In N1835, Jim Xia suggests enabling the POINTER attribute for
coarrays so that they can be returned from functions.

Discussion
The new kinds of pointers in the two suggestions are similar.
Each stores the image index of the target. The Bader proposal is
significantly more complicated since it also contains the idea of
any image being able to access a local object that resides on one
image. The Xia proposal is subsumed by the Rice proposal.

Conclusion
The Rice proposal should be explored further.

........................................................................

PROPOSAL 6: Allow asymmetric allocatable and pointer objects

Needs
An asymmetric allocatable array may be constructed via a coarray
of a type with an allocatable array component, e.g.
      type parent
           real, allocatable :: a(:)
      end type parent
      type(parent) p[*]
      ...
      p[img]%a(:) = 2*p[img]%a(:)
Users would like to declare and use this object directly, e.g.
      real, allocatable :: a(:)[*]
      ...
      a(:)[img] = 2*a(:)[img]

Suggestions
Bill Long suggests the syntax of the Needs paragraph, but
points out that this thing cannot be called an "allocatable coarray"
without having significant side effects elsewhere in the standard.

Conclusion
Do not pursue this further except in the context of teams.

........................................................................

PROPOSAL 7: Add more atomic operations

Needs
Bill Long in N1835 suggested adding atomic compare-and-swap and other
atomic subroutines, atomic operations should be added. These have
existed (with different spelling) in the Cray coarray implementation
from the beginning due to specific customer demands.  All take integer
arguments.  Having standardized and portable names would be good.

The Rice group make the same request (N1883).

Suggestions
The basic compare-and-swap operation is:
   atomic_cas (atom, old, compare, new)
which performs atomically:
   old = atom
   if (old == compare) atom  = new

The following further atomic subroutines are suggested:
atomic_add
atomic_fadd
atomic_and
atomic_fand
atomic_or
atomic_for
atomic_xor
atomic_fxor
where the 'f' versions are the "fetch_and_" versions of the ones with
out the 'f'.

Conclusion
This should be adopted.

........................................................................

PROPOSAL 8: Remove restrictions on coarray components

Needs
Robert Numrich points out (N1835) that many of the restrictions on
derived type components are unnecessary. In particular, he asks for the
removal of the restriction that a child type can add a coarray component
only if its parent has a coarray component. It messes up inheritance by,
for example, forcing every abstract type to contain a dummy coarray
component just in case somebody wants to extend it by adding a
coarray component, which will often be the reason it is being extended.

Suggestions

Conclusion
Review the restrictions on coarray components.

........................................................................

PROPOSAL 9: this_image(x) be scalar if x has corank one

Needs
Robert Numrich (N1835) hits this problem every time he writes new code.

Suggestions

Conclusion
This is not accepted since it would break the Fortran model in which the
result of a function is determined by its arguments and not the context
in which it is called. The functionality is available as
this_image(x,1).

........................................................................

PROPOSAL 10: Add a predicated copy_async intrinsic

Needs
Achieving high performance and maximizing utilization on current
supercomputers requires strategic overlapping of communication and
computation.

Suggestions
The Rice group (N1883) suggests adding a predicated asynchronous
copy intrinsic for this purpose. Predication allows programmer
flexibility in scheduling the copy; asynchrony enables communication
of the data being copied to overlap computation being performed
meanwhile in the program.

Conclusion
To be investigated.

........................................................................

PROPOSAL 11: Decide on the size of the TS

Needs 

Suggestions 

1. Tobias Burnus says (N1883) "As a Fortran user and Fortran-compiler 
developer, I am in favour of a smaller TS. Given that the number of 
compilers well supporting coarrays (as defined in Fortran 2008) is very 
low, the practical experience with the newer features is still rather 
low. Thus, adding the most important missing features as TS allows to 
draw on user experience for additional features during the F201{3,8} 
development."

2. Nick Maclaren says (N1883) "We need to go cautiously."      

3. Robert Numrich would like the extension in the TS to be small.  

4. Reinhold Bader (N1883) would like to have a feature set which is 
approximately 30% bigger in complexity and workload on J3 as the
one implied by N1858.
 
Conclusion
John Reid will revisit his metric for the size of features so that
the size of the TS can be judged.
