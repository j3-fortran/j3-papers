Ballot Comment
--------------

In their DIS Ballot for draft N2146 of Fortran 2018, the GB comment
048 reads:

"Correction. IMAGE_INDEX cannot be an inquiry function, which would be
allowed in a constant expression, because its value depends on the
number of images in the current team (or a team specified by TEAM or
TEAM_NUMBER). For example, if X is declared thus

REAL X[*]

IMAGE_INDEX(X,[18]) has the value 18 if the number of images in the
team is more than 17, and zero otherwise."


with the suggested edit:

Change "Inquiry function" to "Transformational function". {For
IMAGE_INDEX}


Discussion
----------

We agree that a reference to IMAGE_INDEX is not appropriate in a
constant expression.  An additional edit is needed to Table 16.1.

Edit to N2146
-------------

[345:Table 16.1] In 16.7 Standard generic intrinsic procedures, in
Table 16.1 Standard generic intrinsic procedure summary, in the entry
for IMAGE_INDEX, change the Class column entry from "I" to "T".


[390:16.9.97] In 16.9.97 IMAGE_INDEX... in paragraph 2, "Class",
change "Inquiry" to "Transformational".

{Resulting in the whole line reading

Class. Transformational function.
}
