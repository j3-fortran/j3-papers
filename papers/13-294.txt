Changes:
========

Introduction
------------

[iv:para2] {13-276r1} Add missing failed image capability.

[iv:para3] {13-276r1} Say we are providing that capability.




Clause 3 Terms and definitions
------------------------------

[5:3] {13-263r1} Add a sentence to say ISO_FORTRAN_ENV is extended.

[5:8-14] {13-265r1} Move defs for team variable and event variable to
be after team distance.

[5:10] {13-273r2} Delete LOCAL_EVENT_TYPE from event variable def.


Clause 5 Teams of images
------------------------

[9:4-5] {13-289r1} Replace sentence saying access outside the team is
impossible.

Remark 1  : The following sentence, "Except for a SYNC TEAM statement,
            synchronization is possible only with other images if the
            team." is no longer true.  This needs correction.

[9:21+] {13-264r3} Add two constraints on the type TEAM_TYPE.

Remark 2  : The reason for disallowing the POINTER attribute for a
            variable with a subobject of type TEAM_TYPE should be
            documented, with explanation of why it is not a
            requirement for a variable of type TEAM_TYPE.

Remark 3  : We now have very similar sets of constraints for variables
            of type LOCK_TYPE, TEAM_TYPE, and EVENT_TYPE. The basic
            reason is the same in all cases - the desire to restrict
            definition of such variables to a limited set of
            statements.  Perhaps constraints for a new concept, such
            as "restricted type" or "restricted-use type" could be
            written once and then referenced for the three cases.

[9:32+] {13-258r2} Add two constraints on CHANGE TEAM construct.

[10:11-16] {13-288r1} Replace last paragraph of CHANGE TEAM to allow
for separate synchronization.

[10:17-] {13-289r1} Add new section on modified image selectors.

Remark 4  : This new syntax needs illustrative examples. A Note at the
            end of the new section would be good; at least an example
            in the Annex.

[10:18] {13-291r1} Modify R505 to allow choice of the new image index.

Remark 5  : This new syntax needs illustrative examples. A Note at the
            end of the new section would be good; at least an example
            in the Annex.

[10:19] {13-291r1} "integer" -> "int" in syntax term. (Fix wrong name.}

[10:19+] {13-291r1} Add syntax term <form-subteam-spec>, and
constraint.

[10:20] {Editor} Add a sentence saying FORM SUBTEAM is an image
control statement. {Edits were supplied for some cases, but this one
was missed.}

[10:22+] {13-291r1} Add a new paragraph about image index selection.

[10:22+] {13-264r3} Add a new paragraph on execution of FORM SUBTEAMS.

[10:22+] (13-279) Add a new paragraph on synchronization for FORM TEAM
statements. {Editor : Removed the (8.5.2) reference, as this is only
relevant to 007 and not the TS. It can be added back during
integration.}

[10:26] {Editor} Add a sentence saying SYNC TEAM is an image control
statement. {Edits were supplied for some cases, but this one was
missed.}

[10:26-27] {13-264r3} Replace the first sentence after R507.

[11:2-12] {13-276r1} Replace the text of 5.6 STAT_FAILED_IMAGE.

Remark 6  : Would it be useful to have another Note that says failure
            of image 1 of the initial team of images is particularly
            problematic because of the lost connection to standard
            input?


Clause 6 Events
---------------

[13:6] {13-273r2} Delete LOCAL_EVENT_TYPE in subclause title.

[13:7-13] {13-273r2} Replace first two paragraphs of 6.2.

[13:14-15] {13-273r2} Delete LOCAL_EVENT_TYPE in C601 twice.

[13:21] {13-273r2} Delete LOCAL_EVENT_TYPE in C603.

[13:22] {13-273r2} Change "context," to "except".

[13:24+] {13-273r2} Replace text of Note 6.1.

[13:24+] {Editor} Move the new Note 6.1 to [14:11+]. {The old Note was
intended to contrast the restriction on variables of type
LOCAL_EVENT_TYPE with the lack of restriction for EVENT_TYPE. That is
no longer relevant. However, the Note does add explanation of C605 in
6.4. So, the Note was moved to 6.4.}

[13:26] {13-273r2} Add sentence saying EVENT POST is an image control
statement.

[13:29-30] {13-273r2} Modify C604.  {Editor: The paper edit limited
the restriction on <event-variable> to "in an <event-post-stmt>".
That quoted text was removed from the edit.  The restriction is on any
<event-variable>, not only ones in EVENT POST statements.}

[14:2] {13-273r2} Add sentence saying EVENT WAIT is an image control
statement.

[14:4] {13-273r2} Modify C605 to disallow coindexed event variable in
EVENT WAIT.

[14:5] {Editor} Change "image shall wait until" to "image waits
until". {This is a statement of how EVENT WAIT works, not a
requirement on the program.}

[14:6] {13-273r2} Change "shall" to "do".

[14:7-11] {13-290r1} Modify paragraph to fix description of segment
ordering by EVENT POST/WAIT.

[14:11+] {13-290r1} Add a Note explaining EVENT segement ordering.


Clause 7 Intrinsic procedures
-----------------------------

[15:9+] {13-272r1} Add subclause "Atomic subroutines".

Remark 7 : In the case of an optional OLD argument to an atomic
           subroutine, the code generated is different depending on
           whether OLD is present or not. This is a side effect of
           economizing on subroutine names by using the same name for
           two operations. If the user writes an OLD argument into the
           call, it will almost always be the case that it will be
           referenced soon after the call. We should probably say that
           and optional OLD argument that appears shall be present.

[15:9++] {13-280} Append a sentence to the Atomic subroutines
subclause.

[15:14] {13-287r1} "calls to" -> "invocations of"

[15:19] {13-287r1} Add sentence requiring STAT on all calls. {Editor:
Changed "the present team" to "the current team" to use correct term,
and to avoid confusion over "present" when discussing subroutine
calls.}

[15:22-29] {13-276r1} Replace 7.2 para 5 about the STAT argument.

[15:24] {Editor} The replacement 7.2 paragraph 5 has a mixture of
"becomes defined with" and "is assigned" to describe the process of
STAT getting a value.  Changed all cases to "is assigned".

Remark 8 : The first sentence of the new paragraph says that a failed
           execution of a collective is the same as SYNC MEMORY which
           has the effect of making it an image control statement. But
           a successful execution is not an image control statement.
           This is not consistent.  The end of the sentence "and the
           effect...SYNC MEMORY statement" should be deleted.

Remark 9 : The last sentence of the same paragraph as above says "..an
           image had failed..". It is unclear what image counts
           here. Any one from the initial team, or just ones in the
           current team (and hence involved with the call)? Probably
           intend the current team, but it should be clarified.

[15:32] {13-287r1} Add sentence about what happens when error
condition occurs and no STAT argument. {Editor: Moved to be a separate
paragraph after [15:29], similar to style of 8.5.7.}

[16:7] {13-272r1} In the OLD argument description change "becomes" to
"is".

[16:11] {Editor} Change "ORIG becomes defined" to "ORIG is
defined". {For consistency with edit at [16:7].}

[16:21] {13-272r1} In the OLD argument description change "becomes" to
"is".

[16:23] {Editor} Change "to become defined" to "to be defined". {For
consistency with the edit at [16:21].}

[16:35] {13-272r1} In the OLD argument description change "becomes" to
"is".

[16:40] {Editor} Change "OLD to become defined" to "OLD to be
defined". {For consistency with edit at [16:35].}

[17:10] {13-272r1} In the OLD argument description change "becomes" to
"is".

[17:11] {Editor} Change "ATOMIC_XOR" to "ATOMIC_OR. {The Example is
for ATOMIC_OR.}

[17:12] {Editor} Change "to become defined" to "to be defined". {For
consistency with the edit at [17:10].}

[17:23] {13-272r1} In the OLD argument description change "becomes" to
"is".

[17:26] {Editor} Change "to become defined" to "to be defined". {For
consistency with the edit at [17:23].}

[17:27] {Editor} Change "exclusive XOR operation" to "exclusive OR
operation". {The X is redundant with exclusive.}

Remark 10 : In the description of the OPERATOR argument to CO_REDUCE
            we say that the operation is commutative, but fail to say
            is is associative.  That should be added.

[20:38] {13-273r2} Delete "or LOCAL_EVENT_TYPE".

[21:9+] {13-273r2} Add Note 7.1.


Clause 8 Required editorial changes to ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010(E)
-------------------------------------------------------------

[25:32] {13-273r2} Delete "or LOCAL_EVENT_TYPE".

[25:30-26:3] {13-265r1} Move defs for team variable and event variable
to be after team distance.

Remark 11 : In Note 4.48 in 4.5.6.2 The finalization process, we might
            need to add "in the current team" at the end and consider
            rewording to avoid the word "event".

[26:28] {13-289r1} Modify the current edit to allow a team variable in
an image selector.

Remark 12 : The following sentence, "Except for a SYNC TEAM statement,
            synchronization is possible only with other images if the
            team." is no longer true.  This needs correction. {Same
            issue as in TS clause 5.}

[26:40+] {13-289r1} Insert edits to the change in the syntax for image
selectors.

[26:40++] {13-281} Added changes for "all images" -> "images in the
current team" for ALLOCATE and DEALLOCATE. {Editor : Converted the
edits to use the strike-out/insert style used elsewhere in clause 8.}

Remark 13 : We need an edit for the STAT= description in 6.7.4 similar
            to the changes made in 8.5.7 below to account for "current
            team" and also STAT_FAILED_IMAGE".

Remark 14 : Does a CRITICAL section apply to all images of the initial
            team of images, or just the current team? Probably the
            initial set (because it is usually use to protect a global
            resource), but that should be clarified.

[27:12+] {13-282r1} Add exemption from segment ordering for
events. {Editor: Modified the edit instructions to avoid repeating the
first sentence.}

[27:18+] {13-288r1} Added change for "all images" -> "images in the
current team" for SYNC IMAGES. {Editor: changed "of the current team"
to "in the current team" to match the wording of the similar edits for
ALLOCATE/DEALLOCATE.}

[27:18++] {13-281} Add changes for "all images" -> "images in the
current team" for SYNC ALL. {Editor: Converted edits to use the
strike-out/insert style used elsewhere in clause 8.}

[27:27-35] {13-276r1} Replace para on STAT= specifier.

Remark 15 : The new text in the edits for 8.5.7 includes the case of a
            STAT= specifier appearing on an END TEAM statement, but
            there is no syntax for that. In both the replacements for
            paragraphs 1 and 2, and paragraphs 4 and 5. Note that the
            text for paragraph 1 contains the "as an appearance both
            there and in the corresponding END TEAM" which has various
            ambiguities and needs to be fixed.

Remark 16 : For the same sets of edits above, there is no mention of
            EVENT POST or EVENT WAIT. Both of these statements have
            optional STAT=.

[28:9+] {13-272r1} Add new sentence for OLD arguments to atomic
subroutine paragraph.

[28:9++] {13-280} Add new sentence for INTENT(IN) arguments to atomic
subroutine paragraph.

[28:22-29] {13-272r1} Replace para on STAT argument.

Remark 17 : In the table entries for intrinsics on page 19 we refer to
            "all images" 5 times in reference to collectives. This
            needs the "current team" fix.  Or just say "across
            images".

[30:12] {13-273r2} Delete "and LOCAL_EVENT_TYPE".

[30:17+] {13-271} Add cases of variable definition contexts for team
variable and team variable. {Editor: Modified edit by changing "add a
new entry" to "add two new entries" since there are two.}

[32:1] {Editor} Change "LOCAL_EVENT_TYPE" to "EVENT_TYPE" in code
example. {LOCAL_EVENT_TYPE was renamed EVEN_TYPE in the TS.}

[33:5-11] {13-263r1} Replace the section of code.

[33:21] {13-263r1} Replace the line containing MERGE.
