F03/0003   Referencing deferred bindings

  YES Comment for F03/0003 from Bill Long:

    As noted by others, a ",nopass" needs to be added to the procedure
    statement in the definition of type t2.

  YES Comment for F03/0003 from Stan Whitlock:

    I agree with Jim Xia:

      The example given in the interp has another error unrelated to
      the issue raised: the type-bound procedure, deferred_proc, for
      type t2 must have NOPASS attribute.  The example should be
      corrected.

  YES Comment for F03/0003 from Jim Xia:

     The example given in the interp has another error unrelated to the
     issue raised: the type-bound procedure, deferred_proc, for type t2
     must have NOPASS attribute.  The example should be corrected.

  Comment for F03/0003 from Malcolm Cohen:

    I agree with Jim Xia's suggested change to the example.

  Resolution for F03/0003:  passed with change:

    Add ", nopass" to the procedure statement in the definition of type
    t2.

F03/0004   Type-bound procedures and undefined association status

  YES Comment for F03/0004 from Bill Long:

    Wording improvement in the Discussion section: replace "requires
    there to be an object" with "requires an object".

  Comment for F03/0004 from Malcolm Cohen:

    The DISCUSSION section is ok as is.
    It would not hurt to singularise it, but that is unnecessary.

    Bill Long's suggestion is ungrammatical (mixes singular and plural).

    The point of "... always require there to be an object" is that we
    are talking about pointers here, and that we're that there be an
    object in question.  We're not requiring the object, just that there
    be one.  (With disassociated/undefined, there is no object.)

  Resolution for F03/0004: passed with no change

F03/0079   Value of decimal exponent for a real zero value

  Comment for F03/0079 from Malcolm Cohen:

    The discussion seems subtly wrong-headed - not wrong enough for me to
    vote No, but enough to raise questions.

    The discussion focusses on what the effect of a scale factor is, but
    the EN and ES edit descriptors explicitly say that the scale factor
    has no effect; any implementation that formats EN/ES differently
    IN ANY WAY due to scale factor is not conforming already.

    But anyway, shouldn't we just say that the "exponent value" of a real
    zero is zero?

  Resolution for F03/0079: passed with change:

    Change the edit to remove any mention of scale factor.

F03/0080   Formatted output of a negative real zero value

  YES Comment for F03/0080 from Michael Ingrassia:

    Since this interpretation is not compatible with Fortran 90, a
    note to that effect should be added to section 1.6.2 of the
    Fortran 2003 standard as an additional Edit.

  Resolution for F03/0080: passed with no change

    There is no conflict with Fortran 90.

F03/0099   Clause 16 does not account for volatile variable

  No Comment for F03/0099 from Malcolm Cohen:

    In the second edit, everything past the first sentence is redundant,
    unnecessary, and unwanted; it is covered by 16.4.2.0.  Indeed, if it
    were not covered by that, we would need to produce these extra words
    in many other places.

    I disagree with the third and fourth edits not being list items - we
    might as well do away with the whole list in that case!  Perhaps
    someone was worried about the "might" in the list - well, we are
    already in the "sometimes" situation for INQUIRE, I don't see what
    is so different here.

F03/0100   Error in field width for special cases of signed
            INFINITY output

  Comment for F03/100 from Dick Hendrickson:

    The minimum field width required for output of the form "Inf" is 3 if
    no sign is produced, and 4 otherwise. If <w> is greater than zero but
    less than the minimum required, the field is filled with asterisks.
    The minimum field width for output of the form "Infinity" is 8 if no
    sign is produced and 9 otherwise.  If <w> is less than the mimimum
    required but large enough to produce the form "Inf" then the form
                                                       ^
      A comma is needed here to make the sentence parallel to the other
      "If <w>" sentence above

    "Inf" is output.'

  YES Comment for F03/0100 from Bill Long:

    It appears that part of the HISTORY section is missing. It seem like
    we're on the second round with this one.

  No Comment for F03/0100 from Malcolm Cohen:

    Firstly, the "then" should be a comma - see nearby sentences in the
    standard for examples (this is English not Fortran).

    Secondly, the last sentence omits the case of w==0, which is now
    unspecified.

    >> Bill Long responded:

      I disagree with the second comment.  The case for w==0 is covered at
      [228:10].  The text we're trying to fix is just wrong in the current
      standard.  It says that if w=0 (a special case of < 3), the field is
      filled with *.

  Resolution for F03/0100: passed with change:

    Fix edits for 'Inf' and 'NaN' for when <w> is zero.

F03/0102   Evaluation of bound-expr in data pointer assignment

  NO Comment for F03/0102 from Malcolm Cohen:

    The example is already not conforming - see [128:6-7].

    Just because the standard has another redundant sentence is not
    sufficient reason for adding more.

    According to 16.5.5, changing the pointer association can cause
    definition, so that bit is definitely unnecessary.  I don't
    immediately see the corresponding version for 16.5.6 - that would
    appear to be an omission in its own right (unrelated to the example
    given or any legal mutation thereof).  If that omission is fixed
    (or if it is there and I just didn't spot it) this interp (after
    fixing the example) probably needs no edit at all.

  Resolution for F03/0102: failed letter ballot

    We agree with Malcolm's comment.  F2003 [414:4-5] says;

      "If a pointer is associated with a target, the definition status
       of the pointer is either defined or undefined, depending on the
       definition status of the target."

    The correct place for an edit would be in section 16.5.6 "Events
    that cause variables to become undefined".

F03/0103   Restrictions on dummy arguments not present for
            polymorphic type or parameterized derived type

  YES Comment for F03/0103 by Jim Xia:

    My only comment is that rules for optional dummy arguments of either
    polymorphic type or a type with assumed length type parameters seem
    much more relaxed compared to pointer/allocatable cases.  These rules
    make the restrictions on optional pointer/allocatable optional dummy
    arguments too restrictive.

  NO Comment for F03/0103 from Malcolm Cohen:

    The DISCUSSION is completely irrelevant unless we are talking about
    POINTER/ALLOCATABLE, which we are not.

    I probably disagree with the assertion that these two
    situations "is" or were intended to be allowed.

    The question needs some example code we can say is right or wrong.
    (With some example code maybe I could say whether or not I actually
    agree or disagree with the bold assertion in the ANSWER!)

    The edit makes the following code fragment legal:

       Subroutine one(x)
         Double Precision,Optional :: x
         Call two(x)
       End
      Subroutine two(y)
         Real,Optional :: y
         ...

    I can categorically state that we definitely did NOT intend this
    to be legal!

  Resolution for F03/0103: failed letter ballot

    We do not understand the question sufficiently to produce a
    response.

F03/0104   Deallocation and finalization of bounds-remapped pointers

  YES Comment for F03/0104 from Bill Long:

    In ANSWER: (b), first line, add "are" between "finalizations" and
    "processed".

  Comment for F03/0104 from Malcolm Cohen:

    I agree with Bill Long that "are" should be inserted before
    "processed" in the first sentence.

    Furthermore, the first sentence should begin "The standard" at a
    minimum.

  Resolution for F03/0104: passed with change:

    Make the changes described by Bill and Malcolm.

F03/0105   SIZE= specifier and UDDTIO

  NO Comment for F03/0105 from Malcolm Cohen:

    I don't quite follow the reasoning behind this one; it appears to me
    that the characters are being transferred by the DT edit descriptor
    (proxied via the child i/o procedure).

    It is also a horrible restriction that cannot be detected statically.

  Resolution for F03/0105: failed letter ballot

    We believe that the example is standard conforming.  We believe
    the Standard requires SIZE= to work in the presence of child I/O.

F03/0106   Inquire by unit inconsistencies

  Comment for F03/106 from Dick Hendrickson:

    9.9.1.17 NUMBER= At [213:21+], insert "If the unit specified by
    UNIT= is not connected to a file, the value is the unit specified
    by UNIT=."

    This contradicts table C.1 in Appendix C of F95 (page 325).  Should
    there be some sort of note about non-upward compatibility?  Or, should
    the result be -1 instead?

    >> Response from Bill Long:

      Appendix C is not normative.  We only document incompatibilities
      related to normative text.  The normative text in F95 leaves this
      case ambiguous.  The point of the interp is to fill in holes and
      clarify those amibuities.

  NO Comment for F03/0106 from Bill Long:

    The edit for 9.9.1.16 NEXTREC=... is unnecessary and redundant. If
    there is no connection, then certainly the file is not connected for
    direct access, so that case is covered by [213:15].

    The edit for 9.9.1.21 POS=... is unnecessary and redundant. If there
    is no connection, then certainly the file is not connected for
    stream access, so that case is covered by [214:19].

    >> Malcolm Cohen responded:

      I don't agree.  [213:15] presupposes there is a file we are talking
      about, and in the case of UNIT= there is no file so it is
      meaningless to talk about "the file" when there isn't one.

      The same comment for POS=.

      These edits are fixing real unspecified behaviour; if there is no
      file saying something about "the file" says nothing (or the
      standard derefs a null pointer and seg faults, or something).

      I have my own problems with the edits, but that's just because they
      specify a three-element list as "A or B or C" instead of "A, B,
      or C".

  NO Comment for F03/0106 from Stan Whitlock:

    I agree with Jim Xia:

       The edit for NEXTREC= (9.9.1.16) says "At [213:16], after
       'connection' ...".

       But I cannot find the word "connection" on that line, so I'm not
       quite certain what the edit is trying to say.  Does it mean the
       word "connected" at [213:15]?

  NO Comment for F03/0106 from Jim Xia

    The edit for NEXTREC= (9.9.1.16) says "At [213:16], after

    Does it mean the word "connected" at [213:15]?

  Comment for F03/0106 from Malcolm Cohen:

    I disagree with Bill Long's suggested changes for POS= and NEXTREC=.
    The existing wording is entirely talking about "the file"; well, if
    the unit is not connected *there is no file*.  So either it is
    unspecified for an unconnected UNIT=, or the standard seg faults on
    the nonexistent file.

  Resolution for F03/0106: passed with change:

    The directions for the edit should read "At [213:16], after
    'condition' ...".

    Fix the edits for NEXTREC= and POS= to change "if A or if B or
    if C" to "if A, B, or C"

F03/0107   Are the IEEE_* elemental routines required

  NO Comment for F03/0107 from Malcolm Cohen:

    As a matter of principle an interp should be seeking to make the
    smallest possible change.  Insertion of a large note is out of order.
    Those who are interested in the answer will be reading the discussion
    in the interp request.

  Resolution for F03/0107: passed with change:

    We recommend that the large note in the edit not be put into F2003
    but be put into a future standard.

F03/0108   Is IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN consistent with the other

F03/0109   Referencing deferred binding via absent dummy argument

  NO Comment for F03/0109 from Malcolm Cohen:

    This edit is being done to the wrong text.
    Restrictions on the use of nonpresent dummy arguments are meant to be
    in the subclause "Restrictions on dummy arguments not present".

    Furthermore, I see no corresponding restrictions for object-bound
    procedures.  These are invoked via <proc-component-ref> which is
    <variable>%<procedure-component-name>.  This is not a <designator>
    so is not covered by item (5) in 12.4.1.6.  (This will affect lots
    of usages, not just invocation.)  Yes, I appreciate that that wasn't
    quite the question asked by the interp but since these two things
    are so similar we should consider them both.

  Resolution for F03/109: failed letter ballot

    We agree with Malcolm's comment - the edit needs to be elsewhere.

NUMBER: F03/0003
TITLE: Referencing deferred bindings
KEYWORDS: Type-bound procedure, deferred binding
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

I thought that the intent was that it would be
impossible to reference a deferred binding.  However, it
doesn't appear to me that this intent was achieved.
Consider the following program (Sorry, but I don't have
any compilers up to syntax-checking this).

  module defer

    type, abstract :: t
    contains
      procedure (sub), nopass, deferred :: deferred_proc
    end type t
    type, extends(t) :: t2
    contains
      procedure, nopass :: deferred_proc => sub2
    end type t2

  contains
    subroutine sub
      write (*,*) 'Hello.'
    end subroutine sub
    subroutine sub2
      write (*,*) 'Goodbye.'
    end subroutine sub2
  end module defer
  program p
   use defer
   class(t), pointer :: x

   nullify(x)
   call x%deferred_proc

  end program p

Is this a valid program?  If not, what restriction of the
standard does it violate?

Note that x%deferred_proc does not require the value of x (4.5.7)
and thus is not a reference to x (2.5.6).  Therefore, [83:23-24]
does not prohibit this.  Nor is it clear that there is an intent
to prohibit invocation of type-bound procedures for disassociated
pointer objects; except in the case of deferred bindings, this
seems well-defined and potentially useful.

Because x is disassociated, its dynamic type is the same
as its declared type, thus making the interpretation of
x%nondeferred_proc reasonably clear.

ANSWER:

No, this was not intended to be a valid program. A type-bound procedure
may not be invoked through an undefined pointer, a disassociated pointer,
or an unallocated allocatable variable. An edit is supplied to clarify
this situation.  The same answer and edit also apply to F03/0004.

EDITS:

Insert after [04-007: 266: 24] ([07-007r3: 309: 11]):

"The <data-ref> shall not be an undefined pointer, a disassociated
pointer, or an unallocated allocatable variable."

Note: this is the same edit as interp F03/0004.

NUMBER: F03/0004
TITLE: Type-bound procedures and undefined association status
KEYWORDS: Type-bound procedure, dynamic type
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

It appears that the dynamic type is undefined for a pointer with
undefined association status.  This impacts type-bound
procedures. Consider the following program.

  module undefined

    type :: t
    contains
      procedure, nopass :: nondeferred_proc => sub
    end type t
    type, extends(t) :: t2
    contains
      procedure, nopass :: nondeferred_proc => sub2
    end type t2

  contains
    subroutine sub
      write (*,*) 'Hello.'
    end subroutine sub
    subroutine sub2
      write (*,*) 'Goodbye.'
    end subroutine sub2
  end module undefined

  program p
    use undefined
    class(t), pointer :: x
    call x%nondeferred_proc
  end program p

Is this a valid program?  If not, what restriction of the
standard does it violate?  If so, what does it print.

Note that x%nondeferred_proc does not require the value of x (4.5.7)
and thus is not a reference to x (2.5.6).  Therefore, [83:23-24]
does not prohibit this.

If x were disassociated, its dynamic type would be t and the
interpretation of this would be reasonably clear.

However, the standard does not appear to specify the dynamic type
of x when its association status is undefined.  Nor can I find
any prohibition that applies to this case.

ANSWER:

No, the program is not valid, because the standard does not establish
an interpretation of it.  An edit is supplied to clarify this.

Furthermore, the case with a disassociated pointer was not intended to
be valid.  An edit is supplied to correct this oversight.

DISCUSSION:

Access to object-bound procedures (a.k.a. procedure pointer
components) always require there to be an object.  Access to
type-bound procedures of an object was intended to require this too,
but the effect of the NOPASS attribute on this was overlooked.

TITLE: Value of decimal exponent for a real zero value
KEYWORDS: Data edit descriptors, Numeric editing, decimal exponent,
          zero value
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

     In formatted output, what is the value of the
     decimal exponent produced for a real zero value
     under the D, E, EN, ES, and G edit descriptors?

ANSWER:

     In such a case, the decimal exponent should have
     the value zero whether or not a nonzero scale factor
     is in effect.   Edits are supplied to make this clear.

DISCUSSION:

The Fortran 2003 standard does not specify what the value of the
decimal exponent of a real zero value should be under formatted
output.  Every implementation of which Sun is aware uses the value
zero for the decimal exponent unless a nonzero scale factor is in
effect.  Different implementations format real zeros differently under
nonzero scale factors, but the difference is mainly in the form of the
mantissa and not the exponent.

QUESTION:

     Suppose a Fortran processor's representation of the real zero
     value is signed.  When a negative real zero value is written
     using formatted output, does the Fortran 2003 standard require
     the representation of the zero value in the output field to be
     prefixed with a minus sign?

ANSWER:

     Yes, the negative sign is required to appear in formatted output
     of a negative zero value. In subclause 10.6.1, list item (3) at
     [227:3-4] says "The representation of a negative internal value
     in the field shall be prefixed with a minus sign." For a
     processor that distinguishes between positive and negative zero,
     there is no exemption for output at [38:1-6]. For the case of
     IEEE reals, the IEEE_IS_NEGATIVE function at [375:25] explicitly
     says that -0.0 is "negative".

TITLE: Error in field width for special cases of signed INFINITY output
KEYWORDS: formatted output, signed infinity
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting


QUESTION:

Is there an error in the description for the output of a IEEE infinity
with a sign and a field width of 3 or 8?

228:36-37 describes the output for an IEEE infinity and special cases
field widths of 3 and 8.  But, the special casing doesn't consider the
possibility of a plus or minus sign in the field.  A signed infinity
should be special cased for field widths of 9 and 4.  The current text
also fails to take into account the case of <w> = 0, for both Infinity
and NaN values.


ANSWER:

Yes, there is an error in the special cases.  Edits are provided to
correctly describe the required field widths for signed infinities.
An edit is also provided to repair the description of the output of
NaN values.

EDITS:

[228:36-37] In the paragraph beginning "For an internal value that is
an IEEE infinity." in 10.6.1.2.1 "F editing" replace the final
sentence with:

"The minimum field width required for output of the form 'Inf' is 3 if
no sign is produced, and 4 otherwise. If <w> is greater than zero but
less than the minimum required, the field is filled with asterisks.
The minimum field width for output of the form 'Infinity' is 8 if no
sign is produced and 9 otherwise.  If <w> is zero or <w> is less than
the mimimum required but large enough to produce the form 'Inf',
the form 'Inf' is output."

[229:2] In the paragraph in 10.6.1.2.1 "F editing" covering the output
of NaN values, replace the last sentence "If <w> ... asterisks." with
"If <w> is greater than zero and less than 3, the field is filled with
asterisks.  If <w> is zero, the output field is 'NaN'.".

KEYWORDS: deallocate, finalization, bounds-remapping, pointer
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

INTRODUCTION:

Consider the following example assuming a derived type of X is declared
previously and made accessible to the current scoping unit,

    type(X), pointer :: a(:), b(:,:)

    allocate (a(100))
    b(1:10, 1:10) => a

    DEALLOCATE (b)

QUESTION:

    (a) Is DEALLOCATE (b) in the example intended to be standard
        conforming?

    (b) If the answer to (a) is yes, and also assume type X has
        finalizers of both rank-one and rank-two, then which finalizer
        should be invoked by the DEALLOCATE statement.

ANSWER:

    (a) Yes, the example is intended to be standard conforming.  The
        deallocation of pointer b should be executed successfully.

    (b) The Standard is clear about how the finalizations are processed
        in this case.  In 4.5.5.1, the first step in invoking the
        appropriate final subroutine requires a finalizer matching the
        rank of the entity being finalized.  In this case, object b is
        being finalized and therefore the rank-two final subroutine of
        type X will be invoked with object b as the actual argument.

TITLE: Inquire by unit inconsistencies
KEYWORDS: inquire, unit, not connected
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

There are many things that can be inquired about, such as ACTION
or READ, that are purely file or connection properties.  In
some cases, such as ACTION, the specifier description includes
"If there is no connection [the result is] the value UNDEFINED"
or similar words.  In other cases, such as READ, there seems
to be a tacit assumption that there is a file connected to the
unit.  The descriptions refer to "the file" and don't specify a
result if there is no connection.  In most cases, there is a
phrase like "if the processor is unable to determine if the
file ... [the result is] {UNDEFINED, UNKNOWN, -1, etc.}".

Question 1)  Are the inquire specifiers DIRECT, ENCODING,
FORMATTED, NAMED, NEXTREC, NUMBER, POS, READ, READWRITE,
SEQUENTIAL, SIZE, STREAM, UNFORMATTED, and WRITE allowed
in an INQUIRE by unit when there is no file connected to the
unit?

Question 2)  If so, should the descriptions for the above
specifiers be clarified by adding phrases such as "if there is
no file specified or connected" to the "UNKNOWN" result
descriptions?

ANSWER:

Question 1)  Yes.  In an inquiry by unit, the specifiers have
little meaning when there is no file connected to the unit.
However, the standard should specify the results.

Question 2)  Yes, edits are supplied below.

NUMBER: F03/0107
TITLE: Are the IEEE_* elemental routines required
KEYWORDS: IEEE, elemental routines
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

The descriptions for all of the IEEE elemental intrinsics listed in
14.9 say something like "shall not be invoked if
IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE(X) is false".

I believe this was to allow a careful programmer to do something
like

        if (IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE(x)) then
               x = IEEE_SCALB(x,2)
        else
               x = x*4
        endif

and program around partial IEEE support.

But 14.9.2 says that "IEEE_ARITHMETIC contains the following
[routines] for which IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE(X) [is] true"

I'd read that as saying the functions aren't there for cases where
IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE is false.  But, then, there is no way to
program around their absence.  The example above will fail at load
time because IEEE_SCALB is absent.

If a processor provides the IEEE_ARITHMETIC module must it
provide versions of all of the intrinsics for all of the available
datatypes, including those for which IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE() is false?

ANSWER:

Yes, edits are provided to make this clear.

DISCUSSION:  It was intended that the above coding snippet could be
used by a careful programmer to program portably for processors which
have varying degrees of IEEE support.  This might require processors to
provide some stub function for each routine and for each non-IEEE
datatype they support.  If a program invokes one of the stub routines,
it is a run-time programming error.  Nevertheless, a program which
has references to the routines, but doesn't invoke them, must load
and execute.

EDITS:

[370:8-9] Replace

      "for reals X and Y for which IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE(X) and
       IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE(Y) are true"

    with

      "for all reals X and Y"

NOTE:

The following note should be inserted at the end of the section on
IEEE arithmetic in a future standard:

"The standard requires that code such as

        if (IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE(x)) then
               x = IEEE_SCALB(x,2)
        else
               x = x*4
        endif

be executable.  The elemental functions in the IEEE_ARITHMETIC
module (14.9.2) must exist for all real kinds supported by the
processor, even if IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE returns false for
some kinds.  However, if IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE returns false
for a particular kind, these functions must not be invoked
with arguments of that kind.  This allows a careful programmer
to write programs that work on processors that do not support
IEEE arithmetic for all real kinds.

The processor might provide stub routines which allow the program
to link and execute, but which will abort if they are invoked."

KEYWORDS: IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN, IEEE support functions
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

The restriction of IEEE_IS_NAN requires that IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN returns
the value true.  The restrictions for the similar functions
IEEE_IS_{FINITE, NEGATIVE, and NORMAL} all require that
IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE be true.  This is a much stronger restriction.

Should IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN also require that IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE
return true?


ANSWER:

No.  The IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN restriction is weaker than requiring
IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE but IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN is sufficient.
IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE is used in IEEE_IS_FINITE, IEEE_IS_NEGATIVE,
and IEEE_IS_NORMAL because there are no IEEE_SUPPORT_* inquiry
functions to query support for finite, negative, or normal.
IEEE_SUPPORT_INF asks about infinities not finites and
IEEE_SUPPORT_DENORMAL only covers denormals and not the other
non-finites (NaNs and Infinities).

None.
