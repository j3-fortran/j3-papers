I Introduction

A capability called "put with notify" is popular in the SHMEM
community as a very efficient, narrowly focused, synchronization
technique for data transfers between images. The basic idea is to
combine a "put" (definition of a variable on a different image) with a
notification mechanism that allows the receiving image to know that
the data has arrived.  While long requested for coarrays in Fortran,
there was previously no simple syntax to allow for two things (the put
and the notify) on the left side of an assignment.

Fortran 2018 introduced specifiers as part of an image selector. The
addition of a notify-specifier to an image selector, and a NOTIFY WAIT
statement could solve this problem. For example,

    x[10, NOTIFY=nx] = y

where nx is a coarray declared of type(NOTIFY_TYPE).  The NOTIFY_TYPE
is defined in the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV and has properties
similar to type EVENT_TYPE.

The effective notify operation is to the nx variable on the same image
as specified by the image selector.  On image 10,

    NOTIFY WAIT (nx)
    [here it is safe to reference x and get the new value]


II Use-cases

It is common for an image, i, to wait until another image, j, has
updated a coarray on image i before image i continues execution. This
can currently be implemented using events.  For example,

!   On some image other than 10
    x[10] = y
    EVENT POST (nx [10])

!  On image 10
    EVENT WAIT (nx)
    z = x

It could be implemented more efficiently using a put with notify
mechanism:

!  On some image other than 10
   x[10, NOTIFY=nx] = y

! On image 10
   NOTIFY WAIT (nx)
   z = x

The put with notify version differs from the EVENT version in that the
notify can be incorporated into the same data packet as the value of y.
Also the synchronization is only on this particular transfer, and not
all outstanding memory operations on this image.  The put with
notify operation does not constitute segment ordering, and the NOTIFY
WAIT statement is not an image control statement.  The notify variable
semantics are like those of atomic operations with regard to segment
ordering.

If x is an array "waiting" for data to be transferred to separate
elements from one or more images, the NOTIFY WAIT could have an
optional UNTIL_COUNT= clause similar to EVENT WAIT.

! On images other than image 10
  x(i)[10, NOTIFY=nx] = y

! On image 10
  NOTIFY WAIT (nx, UNTIL_COUNT=size(x))
  z(:) = x(:)


III Requirements

A new type NOTIFY_TYPE, similar to EVENT_TYPE would be defined in the
intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.  Like an EVENT_TYPE, it would have
an integer count component which is atomically incremented. Variables
of type NOTIFY_TYPE would be coarrays.

Alternative: Consider using type EVENT_TYPE for the type of notify
variables, instead of inventing a new type NOTIFY_TYPE. The internal
structure of the EVENT_TYPE and NOTIFY_TYPE are the same. Subgroup
rejected this, as they felt mixing EVENT POST and NOTIFY= specifiers
involving the same EVENT_TYPE variable was undesirable.

An optional NOTIFY= specifier would be added to the image selector.
This form of image selector is allowed only as part of the designator
for the variable of an assignment statement.  The effective notify
operation is to the nx variable on the same image as specified by the
image selector. A notify operation atomically increments the notify
variable count on the specified image by one. A notify operation does
not constitute segment ordering.

A NOTIFY WAIT statement with syntax similar to an EVENT WAIT statement
would be added with an optional UNTIL_COUNT= specifier. Successful
execution of a NOTIFY WAIT statement decrements the count of the
notify variable by one, or by the specified UNTIL_COUNT= count, if
specified.  A NOTIFY WAIT statement would have optional STAT= and
ERRMSG= specifiers with the semantics of those on an EVENT WAIT
statement. A NOTIFY WAIT statement is not an image control statement.


IV Specification

An image selector can use a NOTIFY specifier to notify another image
that it can proceed to work on tasks that use common resources. An
image can wait for notification from one or more images that modify a
coarray on the waiting image before it proceeds.

NOTIFY_TYPE is a derived type with private components. It is an extens-
ible type with no type parameters. All components have default initial-
ization. The type is defined in the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic
module.

A scalar variable of type NOTIFY_TYPE is notify variable.  A notify
variable includes a count of the difference between the number of
successful notifies and successful waits for the notify variable. The
initial value of the count of a notify variable is zero. It is
essentially the same as an EVENT variable, but can be modified only by
a NOTIFY= specifier in an image selector or by a NOTIFY WAIT
statement.

A <notify-variable> must be a coarray, but it shall not be
coindexed.

An optional NOTIFY= specifier is added to an image selector. The
NOTIFY= specifier is permitted only in the designator of the variable
of an assignment statement.  Successful execution of an assignment
statement with a NOTIFY= specifier atomically increments the count
of the specified <notify-variable> on the image specified by the image
selector. The value of the <notify-variable> is processor dependent if
the execution of an assignment statement with a NOTIFY= specifier is
unsuccessful.

A new execution control statement, NOTIFY WAIT, is introduced.

  NOTIFY WAIT (<notify-variable> [, <event-wait-spec-list>])

The <event-wait-spec-list> is the same as for an EVENT WAIT statement,
containing an optional <until-spec> and an optional <sync-stat-list>.
A threshold value is computed as for an EVENT WAIT statement. The
executing image shall wait until the count equals or exceeds the
threshold value. A successful wait for a notify variable decrements
the count of <notify-variable> by the threshold value. If execution of
the NOTIFY WAIT statement is unsuccessful, the value of <notify-
variable> is processor dependent.

If the STAT= specifier appears in <event-wait-spec-list> and the exec-
ution of the statement is successful, <stat-variable> is assigned the
value zero. If the STAT= specifier appears in <event-wait-spec-list>
and an error condition occurs, <stat-variable> is assigned a
processor-dependent positive value that is different from the value
STAT_FAILED_IMAGE and STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE from the intrinsic module
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV.

If an ERRMSG= specifier appears and an error condition occurs,
<errmsg-variable> is assigned an explanatory message, truncated or
padded according to the rules of intrinsic assignment.  If no such
condition occurs, the definition status and value of <errmsg-variable>
is unchanged.

The set of error conditions that can occur during execution of a
NOTIFY WAIT statement is processor-dependent.

The NOTIFY WAIT statement is not an image control statement.

A <notify-variable> shall not appear in a variable definition context
except as the <notify-variable> in an NOTIFY= specifier of an image
selector or in a NOTIFY WAIT statement, as an <allocate-object> in an
ALLOCATE statement without a SOURCE= <alloc-opt>, or as an actual
argument in a reference to a procedure with an explicit interface
where the corresponding dummy argument has INTENT(INOUT).  A variable
with a subobject of type NOTIFY_TYPE shall not appear in a variable
definition context except as an <allocate-object> in an ALLOCATE
statement without a SOURCE= <alloc-opt> or as an actual argument in a
reference to a procedure with an explicit interface where the
corresponding dummy argument has INTENT(INOUT).

A notify variable may be referenced or defined during the execution of
a segment that is unordered relative to the execution of another
segment in which the notify variable is defined.  A coarray defined by
an assignment statement with a NOTIFY=specifier cannot be referenced
until after the successful execution of a corresponding NOTIFY WAIT
statement whose <notify-variable> is the same as the <notify-variable>
specified in the NOTIFY= specifier, unless the coarray definition and
the coarray reference are in ordered segments.
