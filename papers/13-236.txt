(A) Wart description:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following situations possible in more complex object-oriented
programming scenarios lead to quite cumbersome coding:

Assume that a subprogram takes multiple polymorphic arguments

subroutine foo_xyz(a, b, c, ...)
  class(x) :: a
  class(y) :: b
  class(z) :: c
  :
end subroutine

Then, performing type resolution inside the subprogram requires multiple
nested SELECT TYPE blocks, even though in many cases only a small subset
of combinations require resolution.

Alternatively, foo_xyz may be one of a large set of procedures bound
to x, y, and z as %foo() and overridden by their descendants,
respectively. Then, it might be desirable to select the actual procedure
invoked based on the combined set of dynamic types of a, b, and c. This
is presently not possible since only one argument may play the role of
"passed argument".


(B) Suggested solution:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a solution for these problems, addition of multiple dispatch
facilities to the Fortran language could be considered. For run time
type and class resolution, the following syntax might be used for a
code block defined inside the subprogram body of foo:

select type (a, b, c)
type (x1, y0, z2)
  : ! exact typing for a, b, c
class (x2, y3, z1)
  : ! class restriction
type (x4), class (y2, z4)
  : ! mixed exact typing and class restriction
end select

Some additional rules may be required to assure that no ambiguities can
occur in resolving to a unique case, and integration with the
concept of generic type-bound procedures and operators will probably
need attention (It may turn out that it is only sensible to allow
"type is" in this context).

Generic type-bound operators provide a nice example for the usefulness
of the feature, since the function result typically will have the same
type as the most extended type of the two arguments:

function add(s1, s2) result(s)  ! generically bound to base as
                                ! operator(+) via first argument
  class(base), intent(in) :: s1
  type(base), intent(in) :: s2
  class(base), allocatable :: s
  allocate(s, mold=s1)
  select type(s, s1)
! only same-type clauses are needed
  type is (base, base)
    : ! do addition for base
  type is (ext, ext)
    : ! do addition for ext
  class default
    : ! throw error
  end select
end function

For invocation of multiple-dispatch type-bound procedures the following
syntax is suggested:

call {a,b,c}%foo(...)

where all passed arguments are removed from the actual argument list in
order of their appearance.

This feature would allow to avoid writing numerous auxiliary procedures
that might be needed to cover all combinations of supported type
extensions.

For full consistency, it may also be necessary to support forced
multiple dispatch for the case where a dummy argument of the same
declared type appears multiple times in a procedure which is bound to
a type:

type :: mytype
  :
contains
  procedure, pass(a,b) :: foo_ab
! must specify in order of appearance and without omissions to avoid
! inconsistency
end type

subroutine foo_ab(a, b, ...) result(c)
  class(mytype) :: a, b
  :
end function

This procedure could only be invoked via

  call {oa,ob}%foo_ab(...)


(C) Questions for J3:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

(1) Is it justifiable to consider the situation described in (A)
    a wart?

(2) What amount of effort will be needed to implement something along
    the lines of (B)?

(3) Is consideration of (B) as a new feature of Fortran 201X in
    conformance with N1925 and therefore appropriate?
