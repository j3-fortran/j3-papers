Subject: New syntax for team coindices
Date: 2013 June 27
Re: N1967

Subsequent to the decision that coindices do not automatically
change within the scope of a CHANGE TEAM, new syntax is proposed
to allow the programmer to specify that coindices in a coarray
reference are relative to the subteam and not to the original
declaration of the coarray.

Edits to N1967
--------------

[In 5.1, Introduction to Teams of Images, paragraph 1, replace]

All image indices are relative to the current team and data
on images outside this team are inaccessible.

[with:]

Syntax has been added to <image-selector> (R624 in
ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010) to permit specification that image indices
are relative to a specified team; otherwise, image indices are
relative to the current team.

[Add a new section after 5.3 CHANGE TEAM]

5.3a Image selectors

The syntax rule R624 <image-selector> in subclause 6.6 of
ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010 is replaced by:

R624	<image-selector> Is	<lbracket> [<team-variable>::]
                                <cosubscript-list> <rbracket>

If <team-variable> appears, its value shall be the same as that
of a <team-variable> that was assigned a value by a
FORM SUBTEAM (8.5.2c) statement for the current team or an ancestor
of the current team, and the cosubscripts are interpreted as if
the current team were the team specified by
<team-variable>.

[In 8.2, Edits to clause 2, paragraph 1, replace:]

All image indices are relative to the current team and
data on images outside this team are inaccessible.

[with:]

Unless <team-variable> is specified in an <image-selector> (R624),
all image indices are relative to the current team.

[After 8.4, insert new section "Edits to clause 6", or merge
with existing section from other papers]

{In 6.6, Image selectors, replace R624 with:}

R624	<image-selector> Is	<lbracket> [<team-variable>::]
                                <cosubscript-list> <rbracket>

{In 6.6 insert afer paragraph 2}

If <team-variable> appears, its value shall be the same as that
of a <team-variable> that was assigned a value by a
FORM SUBTEAM (8.5.2c) statement for the current team or an ancestor
of the current team, and the cosubscripts are interpreted as if
the current team were the team specified by
<team-variable>.
