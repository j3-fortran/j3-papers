Subject: Issue 78 : scope of image indices
Reference: J3/06-007


Discussion of issue 78 (page 515)

First paragraph. We agree that edits are needed in 16 and A.

Second paragraph. We see no problem over pending data transfer operations
being handled for the file, except that individual images may have to wait
longer than necessary. No edits seem to be needed to cover this. 

Third paragraph. The scoping model is addressed in other papers. In 
particular, we now think that giving units the scope of all images was
a mistake. We see no need for a further level of scoping.
