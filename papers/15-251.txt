This is mostly typos and similar, perhaps this paper can be passed
directly to the Editor.

Edits:

[xvii:10] {part 3 is withdrawn so delete the reference}
delete the line

{subgroup defers to the editor on whether this is important,
but the verb tense is bad English-  "none" is singular}

{correct the verb}

[121:24] change "are pointers" to "is a pointer"
(or "has the pointer attribute")

{what is the "allocation transfer procedure" ?
I hope it's move_alloc() }

{use same language as previous paragraph}

[131:9-10] 6.7.1.3 change "allocation transfer procedure"
to "intrinsic procedure MOVE_ALLOC"
