Subject: Assumed-size arguments with INTENT(OUT)

NUMBER: F03/0045
TITLE: Finalization and assumed-size arguments with INTENT(OUT)
KEYWORDS: finalization, INTENT(OUT), assumed size, dummy argument
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

MODULE m
  TYPE t
    INTEGER :: i
  CONTAINS
    FINAL :: finalizeT
  END TYPE
CONTAINS
  ELEMENTAL SUBROUTINE finalizeT(f)
    TYPE(t), INTENT(INOUT) :: f
    f%i = 10
  END SUBROUTINE
END MODULE

SUBROUTINE xyz (d)
  USE m
  TYPE(t), INTENT(OUT) :: d(*)
END SUBROUTINE

PROGRAM foo
  USE m
  EXTERNAL xyz
  TYPE(t) :: a(10) = t(5)
  CALL xyz(a(2))
END PROGRAM

4.5.5.2 of Fortran 2003 states:
    When a procedure is invoked, a nonpointer, nonallocatable object
    that is an actual argument associated with an INTENT(OUT) dummy
    argument is finalized.

For assumed-size arguments, this situation is similar to that of
default initialization with INTENT(OUT).  Default initialization is
prohibited for INTENT(OUT), assumed-size dummy arguments by C544.  A
similar restriction on finalization may have been overlooked.

Was this program intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

No, this program was not intended to be standard-conforming.  An edit
is supplied to correct this oversight.

DISCUSSION:

The unstated philosophy of assumed-size arrays in the standard is that
no action is allowed on an assumed-size array which would need to be
applied elementally to the whole array.  That is why no whole array
assignment is allowed, for example.

In accordance with this philosophy,
(1) types with ultimate allocatable components also need to be excluded
    from being INTENT(OUT) assumed-size, as procedure invocation in this
    case requires deallocation of all the allocated components.

(2) polymorphic INTENT(OUT) assumed-size arrays should also be excluded,
    as they might have finalisation, default initialisation or
    allocatable components.

This interp subsumes Fortran 2003 interp #0060.

EDITS:

All edits refer to 04-007.

[80:9]  Before "of a type", insert
        "polymorphic, of a finalizable type, of a type with an
         ultimate allocatable component, or".
