Subject: bad example in Note 10.34
Date: 2017 October 12
Reference: 17-007r2

1. Discussion

The last example of a constant expression in NOTE 10.34 could be
improved by saying that the name number_of_decimal_digits is the
name of a integer named constant.  An edit is provided.

2. Edit to 17-007r2

[169] 10.1.12 Constant expression. NOTE 10.43 (8th line of the Note)
      Replace "bounds and X is default real" with
"bounds, X is default real, and number_of_decimal_digits is an
 integer named constant".
