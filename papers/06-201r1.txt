Subject: Impure ELEMENTAL integration
References: J3/06-143, Resubmit of 06-159

Discussion:
__________

Impure elementals would be better-integrated and more functional
if we remove the following restriction:

"In a reference to an elemental subroutine, either all actual
arguments shall be scalar, or all actual arguments associated with
INTENT (OUT) and INTENT (INOUT) dummy arguments shall be arrays of
the same shape..."

Instead, it should be OK to have a scalar actual corresponding to
INTENT(IN/INOUT) dummies for impure elementals, since the order of
operations is prescribed (array-element order), and this there is
no indeterminacy in using the same scalar argument.

Edits:
__________

[323:2] Replace "all such actual arguments are arrays" with "at least
one such argument is an array"

[337:3] At the start of the second-sentence of the paragraph, replace
"In a reference to an elemental subroutine" with "In a reference to
a pure elemental subroutine"

[337:5] Add a new sentence after the second sentence of the paragraph:
In a reference to an impure elemental subroutine, all actual arguments
shall be conformable.

[337:5+] In the third sentence of the para, replace:
"the actual arguments associated"->"some actual arguments associated"

Example:
__________

By allowing impure ELEMENTALs, as well as scalar INTENT(OUT) arguments,
the following example becomes legal:

module RandomElemental
   use iso_c_binding
   implicit none
   private

   type, abstract, public :: Random_Sequence
   contains
      procedure(RandomNumber), deferred, pass(sequence) :: Generate
   end type   

   abstract interface
      impure elemental subroutine RandomNumber(sequence,number)
         import
         class(Random_Sequence), intent(inout) :: sequence
         real, intent(out) :: number
      end subroutine
   end interface

   type, extends(Random_Sequence), public :: Fortran_Random_Sequence
      integer(c_long_long) :: count=0
   contains
      procedure :: Generate=>FortranRandomNumber
   end type

contains

   elemental subroutine FortranRandomNumber(sequence,number)
      class(Fortran_Random_Sequence), intent(inout) :: sequence
      real, intent(out) :: number
      
      sequence%count=sequence%count+1 ! Check for sequence exhaustion
      call random_number(number)
      
   end subroutine
   
end module

program TestRandom
   use RandomElemental
   
   type(Fortran_Random_Sequence) :: sequence
   real, dimension(100,100) :: array
   
   call sequence%Generate(array)
   write(*,*) "Generated ", sequence%count, " random numbers"
   
end program
