========

[92:1-2 C516] C516 would be better positioned near constraints on dummy
arguments at [324:42+ C1263+].  Move it there.

[97:5 5.5.8.2p2] Hyperlink "local variable".

[98:14 R523] Set the <assumed-implied-spec> syntax term in syntax-term
font.

[100:22,26 5.5.10p3] After "a pointer variable" insert "or a procedure
pointer that is not the result of a function reference".

[116:12 C5104] C441 prohibits sequence types from having type
parameters.  Delete "with the same type parameter values".  Replace "the
same type" with "that type".

[116:19+5-15 NOTE 5.42] The second through fifth paragraphs duplicate
C598 and C5102-C5105, less than half a page distant.  Further, they
express requirements, violating ISO requirements.  Delete the second
through fifth paragraphs.  In the fifth paragraph, replace "Further"
with "In addition to the above constraints, further".
