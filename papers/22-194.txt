OpenACC Liaison Report
======================
Information about OpenACC, including the current standard document,
training materials, and upcoming events can be found at
http://www.openacc.org/.

The current OpenACC standard is version 3.2. Version 3.2 of the OpenACC
specification was adopted November 2021.  The specification can be found
at https://www.openacc.org/specification.

News
----
In November the next release of the specification (tentatively 3.3) will
be announced. This released focuses primarily on standardizing
extensions that appear in the NVIDIA compilers and are used by multiple
important applications.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise has renewed their support for OpenACC in the
crayftn compiler.

NVIDIA has released HPC SDK 22.9 with support for OpenACC in C, C++,
and Fortran.

GCC 13 improves support for OpenACC on AMD GPUs, support already mature
for NVIDIA GPUs.

Progress continues on upstreaming support for OpenACC into the
LLVM Compiler Infrastructure Project through the CLACC and FLACC
projects. More information on this compiler is available at the OpenACC
website, https://www.openacc.org/.

Applications
------------
There are over 250 applications in production or development using
OpenACC, including:
 - Gaussian 16
 - ANSYS Fluent
 - VASP 6
 - MPAS-A
 - COSMO
 - GAMERA for GPU
 - Quantum Espresso
 - OVERFLOW

More information on these can be found on the OpenACC
web site at https://www.openacc.org/success-stories.

Community Engagement
--------------------
OpenACC will have a BOF session Tuesday, November 15 at 5:15 Central
at SC22 in Dallas.

The annual OpenACC Summit was held in August. This was the first
year the talks were peer reviewed rather than by invitation only.
Recordings are available on the OpenACC YouTube channel.

Hackathons
----------
OpenACC continues to host numerous hackathons each year. OpenACC is
generally the preferred approach for Fortran applications attending
the events. Event dates are posted at
https://www.gpuhackathons.org/events. It is not a requirement to use
OpenACC directives to participate in these hackathons.
