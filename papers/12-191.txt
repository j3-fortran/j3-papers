NUMBER: F08/0086
TITLE: 	Implied-shape and separate PARAMETER statement
KEYWORDS: Implied-shape, PARAMETER
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification or Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Q1.  Consider

  Program test1
    Character(*) a,b(*)
    Dimension c(*)
    Parameter (a='123', b=['1','2','3'])
    Character(*),Parameter :: c = [ '44','55','66' ]
    Print *,a,b,c
  End 

The definition of the assumed-length character named constant A
conforms to Fortran 77 to Fortran 2008.  However, the definition of
the implied-shape named constant B appears not to conform to Fortran
2008, as the standard says in 5.4.11p2
  "A named array constant defined by a PARAMETER statement shall have
   its shape specified in a prior specification statement."
On the other hand, the named constant C does not have such a
requirement, so its definition would appear to be conforming.

This apparent requirement on the named constant B would thus appear to
be inconsistent with those on the named constant C, as well as
inconsistent with the way that assumed length works, and with the
general principle of allowing attributes to be specified either in a
single type declaration statement or with separate specification
statements.

Is the program intended to conform to the Fortran standard?

Q2. Consider

  Subroutine test2(a)
    Real,Dimension(*) :: a,b,c
    Integer,Parameter :: b = 123
    Parameter (c = 45.6)
    a(b) = c
  End Subroutine

The <array-spec> in the type declaration statement is ambiguous; if it
is an <implied-shape-spec> then the declaration of A as an
assumed-size array is erroneous, but if it is an <assumed-size-spec>
then the declarations of B and C as implied-shape arrays is erroneous.

Is this program-unit intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

A1.  No, the program is not intended to conform to the Fortran
     standard.  A clarifying edit is supplied to make it clear that an
     implied-shape array specification is only permitted for a named
     constant whose value is given in the same statement.  This makes
     it clear that the declarations of both B and C are non-conforming.

A2. No, the program is not intended to conform to the Fortran
    standard.  This is clarified by the same edit that clarifies the
    answer to question 1.

ALTERNATIVE ANSWER:

A1.  Yes, the program is intended to conform to the Fortran standard.
     An edit is supplied to remove the inadvertant requirement in
     5.4.11.

A2.  Yes, this was intended to conform to the Fortran standard.  Edits
     are left as an exercise for the reader.

EDIT to 10-007r1:

[97:27+] In 5.3.8.6, insert new constraint
  "C535a An <implied-shape-spec> shall appear only in a type
         declaration statement in which the PARAMETER keyword
         appears."

ALTERNATIVE EDIT to 10-007r1:

[107:11] In 5.4.11p2, change "shape" to "rank".
