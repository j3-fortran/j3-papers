Subject: "advice regarding additional intrinsics ignores"

The advice given in paragraph 4 of Section 1.4 of the
Fortran 2008 ignores a important issue that affects
portability.  Consider the program

       PROGRAM MAIN
         INTERFACE SQRT
           INTEGER FUNCTION NISQRT(I)
           END FUNCTION
         END INTERFACE
         CALL SUBR
       CONTAINS
         SUBROUTINE SUBR
           INTRINSIC SQRT
           PRINT *, SQRT(4)
           PRINT *, SQRT(4.0)
         END SUBROUTINE
       END

       INTEGER FUNCTION NISQRT(I)
         NISQRT = -INT(SQRT(REAL(I)))
       END

A user might expect that program to write something like

  -2
  2.0

If, however, the implementation provides a specific
interface for SQRT that takes an argument of type INTEGER,
that interface will be chosen over the user's external
function according to the rules presented in
Section 12.5.5.2 of the Fortran 2008 draft.

I suggest adding a warning against declaring a name to have
the INTRINSIC attribute in a context where that name is
accessible as the name of a generic interface.

J3 response:

This is similar to the question asked in J32008 (08-222).

It is not possible for the standard to warn about all possible
interactions of programs with processor extensions.  This is explicitly
addressed by subclause 1.4p4.

[12.5.5.2 NOTE 12.41+]
Editor: Insert a new note after NOTE 12.41:

"NOTE 12.41+
  The interaction between host association, the INTRINSIC attribute, and
  generic resolution is complicated.  Consider the following program:

       PROGRAM MAIN
         INTERFACE SQRT
           INTEGER FUNCTION NISQRT(I)
           END FUNCTION
         END INTERFACE
         CALL SUBR
       CONTAINS
         SUBROUTINE SUBR
           INTRINSIC SQRT
           PRINT *, SQRT(4)
           PRINT *, SQRT(4.0)
         END SUBROUTINE
       END

       INTEGER FUNCTION NISQRT(I)
         NISQRT = -INT(SQRT(REAL(I)))
       END

  If the processor provides SQRT for integer arguments as an extension,
  that intrinsic procedure will be invoked instead of the users NISQRT
  function.  This occurs because the INTRINSIC statement takes priority
  over host association.  It is recommended that the INTRINSIC attribute
  not be specified for a name that is the same as the name of a generic
  interface accessed by host association."
