Discussion
----------

An ALLOCATE statement for a non-coarray <allocate-object> that has a
coarray ultimate component is not an image control statement because
the coarray ultimate component will be undefined so that its value
will not be able to be referenced or defined by any image. However, a
DEALLOCATE statement for such an object is an image control statement
because it involves deallocation of the coarray ultimate component on
all the images, which requires synchronization.

If a non-coarray <allocate-object> of unlimited-polymorphic type were
allowed to be allocated to have a dynamic type with a coarray ultimate
component its deallocation would be an image control statement. It was
intended to disallow this because it is undesirable to have a data
value determine whether a statement is an image control statement.

For the ALLOCATE statement, the constraint
   C953 (R932) The declared type of <source-expr> shall not have a
   coarray ultimate component.
applies both to MOLD= and SOURCE= and ensures that an unlimited-
polymorphic <allocate-object> is not given a dynamic type with a
coarray ultimate component in this way but there is no comparable
constraint for <type-spec>. Such a constraint is not needed for a
polymorphic <allocate-object> with a declared type that has a coarray
ultimate component and the constraint on MOLD= is not needed in this
case either.

I propose moving the SOURCE= part of C953 to C952, deleting the MOLD=
part of C953 and adding this restriction:
"If an <allocate-object> is unlimited polymorphic, the dynamic type of
neither <type-spec> nor <source-expr> shall have a coarray ultimate
component." It is a runtime restriction so it cannot be a constraint
but can be normative.

I have found that the subclause on the STAT= specifier for ALLOCATE
and DEALLOCATE does not allow for the deallocation of an object with
a coarray ultimate component. I propose edits to correct this.

While looking at 21-007r2, I noticed an error in a note, and places
where the text appears not to cover adequately the case of an object
with a coarray subobject and cases where "component" is used when
"ultimate component" is needed. Edits are proposed for these.

Edits to 21-007r2
-----------------

[74:5-] In 7.5.4.3 Coarray components, NOTE 1, last sentence, change
"an array, an allocatable object, a coarray, or a pointer" to
"a coarray or a pointer" so that the sentence becomes
"An object of type grid_type cannot be a coarray or a pointer."

[142:27,30] In 9.7.1.1 Form of the ALLOCATE statement, in C952 after
"not" add "have a coarray ultimate component," so that the constraint
becomes
"C952 (R929) If SOURCE= appears, the declared type of <source-expr>
shall not have a coarray ultimate component, be EVENT_TYPE, LOCK_TYPE,
or NOTIFY_TYPE from the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV, or have a
potential subobject component of type EVENT_TYPE, LOCK_TYPE or
NOTIFY_TYPE."
Delete "C953 (R932) The declared type of <source-expr> shall not have
a coarray ultimate component."

[143:12] In 9.7.1.1 Form of the ALLOCATE statement, at the end of
para 5 add "If an <allocate-object> is unlimited polymorphic, the
dynamic type of neither <type-spec> nor <source-expr> shall have a
coarray ultimate component."

[143:34-35] In 9.7.1.2 Execution of an ALLOCATE statement, para 4,
change the third sentence to
"If the coarray is a dummy argument or a subobject of a dummy argument,
the ultimate argument (15.5.2.4) of the dummy argument shall be the
same object on those images."

[147:10-11] In 9.7.3.2 Deallocation of allocatable variables, change
para 11 to
"If a DEALLOCATE statement that deallocates a coarray has an
<allocate-object> that is a dummy argument or a subobject of a dummy
argument, the ultimate argument (15.5.2.4) of the dummy argument shall
be the same object on those images."

[148:7&9] In 9.7.4 STAT= specifier, para 5,
in sentence 1 change "with a coarray <allocate-object>" to
"that is an image control statement (11.7.1)"
and in sentence 2 change "an <allocate-object> is a coarray" to
"the statement is an image control statement"
so that the two sentences become
"If an ALLOCATE or DEALLOCATE statement that is an image control
statement (11.7.1) is executed when the current team contains a stopped
image, the stat-variable becomes defined with the value
STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE from the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV (16.10.2).
Otherwise, if the statement is an image control statement, the current
team contains a failed image, and no other error condition occurs, the
stat-variable becomes defined with value STAT_FAILED_IMAGE from the
intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV."

[170:5] In 10.2.1.2 Intrinsic assignment statement, para 1, item (1),
add "ultimate" before "component" so that the item becomes
"if the variable is polymorphic it shall be allocatable, and not a
coarray or a data object with a coarray ultimate component".

[170:9] In 10.2.1.2 Intrinsic assignment statement, para 1, item (3),
add "ultimate" before "component" so that the item becomes
"the variable and expr shall be conformable unless the variable is an
allocatable array that has the same rank as expr and is not a coarray
or of a type that has a coarray ultimate component".
