Subject: Intelligent Macros - Specs and Syntax
Date: 2006/02/14
Reference: J3-014, J3/05-280, J3/06-123.

1. Introduction

Paper 05-280 proposed the introduction of an intelligent macro facility to
satisfy the "generic programming" requirement implicit in J3-014.  This paper
proposes detailed specifications and syntax for that facility.  Rationale is
not included in this paper - please see J3/05-280.

The macro facility described here is envisaged as an integral part of the
Fortran processor, not as a separate text-processing tool.  However, it could
be implemented by a software tool that had sufficient Fortran intelligence.

2. Specifications

2.1 Scoping

Macros shall be treated the same as other local entities with respect to
scoping, that is, they have scoping-unit scope (not file scope unlike "cpp"
and friends).

Macros shall be accessible via both use and host association.

Macro names shall be class 1 names.

A macro definition is a construct but not a scoping unit.  The macro dummy
arguments have the scope of the construct, i.e. they shall be construct
entities.

2.2 Kinds of macros

Statement-level macros shall be provided.  These are macros whose invocation is
a whole statement, and which expand to one or more whole statements.

At this point, function-level macros and others (such as list macros) are not
being proposed.  Although these would have useful functionality, they are
beyond the scope of the current proposal and can be added later.

2.3 Definition and invocation

A (statement-level) macro definition shall be a specification construct.

Invocation of a statement-level macro shall be a statement.

Macros shall be invocable with keyword arguments.

A macro shall not be expanded unless it has been previously defined or
accessed by use or host association.
{A macro invocation therefore cannot be the first statement of a program unit.
 NB: This does not prohibit recursive macro expansion; but that only works if
 controlled by macro conditionals (see below).}

2.4 Statement generation

A statement macro generates whole statements.  These may be any kind of
statement (but see next point) including specification statements and
executable statements.  {Note: That includes generating macro
definitions and expansions.}

A macro expansion shall be properly nested with respect to scope; that
is, it shall not generate a statement which terminates the scope the
EXPAND statement appears in.  {In particular, this means that it
cannot generate a program-unit END statement, but may generate
whole contained subprograms.}

2.5 Macro actual arguments

An actual argument shall be a sequence of one or more tokens excluding
semi-colon.  Delimiters (excluding "/") shall be matched.  Commas are only
permitted inside delimiters (again, excluding "/").

Note: This is very permissive.  We could be a lot more restrictive - for
example, requiring it to follow the syntax of an expression, but since the
result of the expansion needs to satisfy our syntax rules there seems little
point in requiring the arguments (before expansion) to satify some set of
syntax rules.  Having it be this permissive is simple to describe, puts less
burden on the implementor, and facilitates implementation as a separate tool.

Expanding a macro replaces each dummy argument appearing in the body of the
definition with (all the tokens of) its corresponding actual argument.  Tokens
are replaced as a whole, never in part.

2.6 Continuation lines and concatenation

Breaking tokens across continuation lines in macro definitions and macro
invocations does not affect macro expansion - it is as if they were joined
together before replacement.

The limit on size for a sequence of lines (initial line + continuation lines)
applies after expansion, but the individual line limits do not; so it is
sort-of equivalent to joining the whole sequence together into a single line,
doing the replacements, then breaking into a sequence of individual lines
again.  As long as we don't talk about macro expansion as a textual thing, but
talk about its effect on the tokens, we don't need to describe that (except for
the overall limit).

Note: The size limit is intended to allow implementation as a separate tool.

It shall be possible to concatenate tokens to form new ones, using a special
token concatenation "operator".  The result of a token concatenation shall be
acceptable as a single token.

2.7 Iteration, conditions, and macro variables

A macro shall be able to iterate (i.e. it shall have loops).
Loop expansion shall be controlled by macro expressions (see below).

Macros shall have "macro variables".  A loop in a macro will iterate a macro
variable over a range.  A macro variable has the scope of the macro expansion,
and is only used in macro contexts.  It is another construct entity.  Only
integer macro variables are allowed.

A macro variable shall be a class 1 name, with the scope of the macro
definition.  All macro variables shall be explicitly declared.  (Macro dummy
arguments are like macro variables except for the "integer" part, and appearing
in the macro's dummy argument list counts as explicit declaration.)  Macro
variables are replaced by their value during expansion.

Macro dummy arguments may be optional.  Expanding an optional macro dummy
argument that is not present produces no token.

A macro expression, after expansion, shall be an initialization expression
except that it may also include a reference to the PRESENT intrinsic whose
actual argument was a macro dummy argument.

A macro shall be able to conditionally include code depending on a macro
expression.

Macro control statements (for iteration, conditional processing, etc.) shall
appear on one or more lines by themselves, i.e. not with any other macro
control statement nor with any macro body statement.  (The normal rules for
continuation apply, thus one or more lines.)

Because a macro being expanded as an inline subroutine call will want to
have variables that are local to the macro expansion, there shall be a new
kind of construct which allows declarations of variables local to that
construct.  It should also allow declarations of types and named
constants.  All of these are construct entities; entities of the same name
outside the scoping unit are inaccessible by that name.

2.8 Macro expansion

2.8.1 Nested macro definitions

It shall be possible to define new macros within a macro definition.  The new
macro is defined when its containing macro is expanded, not at macro definition
time.

2.8.2 Macro redefinition

It shall not be possible to redefine a macro.

2.8.3 Placement of macro invocation

A macro invocation may occur anywhere that its name is accessible.
{It cannot appear as the first statement of a program-unit.}

However, if it is the consequence of a logical IF, it shall expand to exactly
one statement.  Obsolescently, the same for a nonblock-DO loop ending
statement.  (And that statement shall be valid in that context, but that goes
without saying.)

2.8.4 Expansion Algorithm

(1) Process each macro statement, looping for macro DO statements,
    conditionally processing those within macro IF statements.

(2) When processing each macro statement;
    (a) replace macro integer variables with their value (as an integer
        literal constant in "I0" format),
    (b) replace macro dummy arguments with their actual value,
    (c) perform any token concatenation,
    (d) identify the statement as a
        - macro control statement; act upon it.
	- nested macro definition; start defining the new macro.
	- macro expansion statement; expand the referenced macro.
	- macro body statement; see below.

A macro body statement is just a sequence of tokens.  It has no meaning or
effect until after expansion, when it forms a whole Fortran statement, part
of a statement, or several statements.

It shall be possible to have multiple macro body statements contributing to a
single expanded statement.  This shall be done in a similar manner to normal
continuation lines.  However, unlike the situation with normal continuation
lines, tokens shall not be split across generated continuations (token joining
should be done with the token concatenation operator, not by generated
continuations).  For simplicity, continuation generation shall be done with
the same syntax independent of the source form.

Contiguous whitespace (blanks, continuation-newlines) is either preserved or
may be replaced by a single blank character; this is processor-dependent.

A Fortran processor should contain the capability of displaying the results of
macro expansion.  {NB: This is a recommendation, not a requirement.}
Whether comments in a macro definition are preserved in the expansion is
processor-dependant.

2.9 OPTIONAL features

We do not recommend pursuing these initially.  None of these are essential
to the basic facility; they are here recorded for potential future reference.

2.9.1 EXIT and CYCLE for MACRO DO

These could be spelt MACRO EXIT and MACRO CYCLE, though MACRO EXIT has an
unfortunate flavour to it.  Additionally, macro DOs could have "special"
construct names (whose scope is that of the macro expansion).

2.9.2 Unique symbol generation

For generating temporary variables, it could be useful for a macro to be able
to generate guaranteed-to-be-unique symbols.  This would allow a macro to
create temporary variables of its own which could not conflict with its
arguments or the invocation context.  This option would require
character-valued macro variables, see 2.9.2.

2.9.3 Character-valued macro variables

Allow macro variables (other than the macro dummy arguments) to have character
values.  This is only useful if we have some way of assigning values to them,
such as unique symbol generation (2.9.1).

2.9.4 Persistant macro variables

Allow macro variables whose scope is the scoping unit containing the EXPAND
statement.  This is useless with initial values and/or macro assignment.

2.9.6.6.6 Macro COMMON

The macro common statement
  MACRO COMMON/FRED/ x
establishes macro variable X which can be used by any macro invocation in
any scoping unit which declares the MACRO COMMON /FRED/.

2.10 Comments

(1) The objective is for statement-level macros to provide a convenient way to

    (a) use macros to create modules, just as conveniently as in the previously
        proposed "parameterised module" facility;
    (b) use macros to create types and procedures; and
    (c) use macros to create inline sections of code conveniently (like an
        inline procedure call).

    If there is some aspect of module creation that demands different treatment
    from the other requirements listed above, we could have a special syntax
    for module macros.  I do not believe this to be necessary however.

(2) If macros are always distinguishable from other classes of names, they
    could form their own name class.  Otherwise, they will need to be standard
    class 1 names. 

    In the proposed syntax below, definition and invocation use special syntax
    to delineate macro names (i.e. there can be no clash with other names);
    however, the USE and IMPORT statements would probably not want to use
    special syntax.

    Having them as standard class 1 names keeps things simpler for us and
    for users.

(3) One can effectively pass macro names as macro arguments, since expansion
    of arguments occurs before analysis of each macro body statement.  For
    example:
      DEFINE MACRO :: Iterator(count,Operation)
        DO i=1,count
          EXPAND Operation(i)
        END DO
      END MACRO

(4) Using the macro access to initialization expressions, we can create
    interfaces and procedures for all kinds of a type, for example:
DEFINE MACRO :: i_square_procs()
  MACRO INTEGER i
  MACRO DO i=1,1000
    MACRO IF (SELECTED_INT_KIND(i)>=0 .AND.
              (i==1 .OR. SELECTED_INT_KIND(i)/=SELECTED_INT_KIND(i-1))) THEN
      FUNCTION i_square_range_%%i(a) RESULT(r)
        INTEGER(SELECTED_INT_KIND(i)) a,r
        r = a**2
      END FUNCTION
    MACRO END IF
  MACRO END DO
END MACRO

3. Syntax

3.1 Overview

The macro concatenation operator shall be "%%".
{Note: Many other values are plausible, e.g. "#", "&".}
This concatenation operator shall appear only within a macro definition.
The result of a concatenation shall be acceptable as a single token.
Note: the result token might be a different kind of token to one or both of
the original tokens.

Statement-level macro definitions begin with a DEFINE MACRO statement, and end
with an END MACRO statement, e.g.
  DEFINE MACRO :: puts_(string)
    CALL puts(string//ACHAR(0))
  END MACRO
The double colon is required in the DEFINE MACRO statement, in case of vendor
extensions which begin with the word "DEFINE".  A define-macro statement may
contain attributes, in particular PRIVATE and PUBLIC.  The END MACRO statement
may optionally mention its name.

A macro dummy argument may be declared optional with the MACRO OPTIONAL
statement, for example
  DEFINE MACRO :: hello(variable,initvalue)
    MACRO OPTIONAL :: initvalue

The PRESENT intrinsic shall be extended to allow a zero-argument form which
always returns FALSE.  This form shall be allowable in an initialization
expression.  For example (continuing the previous example),
    MACRO IF (PRESENT(initvalue)) THEN
      REAL :: variable = initvalue
    MACRO ELSE
      REAL variable
    MACRO END IF

Continuation generation (multiple macro body statements to a single generated
statement) shall be done by appending "&&" to the end of each macro body
statement whose output should be continued.  Since generated continuations
never join tokens together, we do not need to allow "&&" at the beginning of
the statement.  This syntax (&&) is the same whether the source is fixed form
or free form.

Macro invocation (for statement-level macros) shall use the EXPAND statement,
e.g.
  EXPAND puts_("Hello World"//ACHAR(10))

Macro loops shall begin with a MACRO DO statement and end with a MACRO END DO
statement.  For example,
  MACRO DO i=1,rank
    ...
  MACRO END DO
The iteration variable shall be an explicitly declared macro variable.

A macro conditional shall begin with a MACRO IF statement and end with a MACRO
END IF statement.  For example,
  MACRO IF (SELECTED_REAL_KIND(30)>=0) THEN
    REAL(SELECTED_REAL_KIND(30)) QPV
  MACRO END IF
Macro versions of ELSE IF and ELSE may also be used.

Macro variable declarations take the form of a MACRO type declaration
statement.  The type shall be INTEGER, and a double colon shall follow the
<type-spec>.  For example,
  MACRO INTEGER :: i
A kind may be specified.

A new executable construct, the BLOCK construct, allows declarations of
construct entities whose scope is the scope of the BLOCK construct.
  BLOCK
    <specification-part>
    <execution-part>
  END BLOCK
