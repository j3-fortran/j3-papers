Discussion for UTI 148, page 345:

The editor objects that DBLE and CMPLX were omitted from the
discussion of padding or truncation of boz arguments even though boz
arguments are legal for those functions.  However, the results of
those functions are in terms of references to REAL, so the rules for
REAL would apply.  A Note is added to clarify this.

The editor also notes that "considered to be" is vague.  A similar
situation on page 156, discussing padding character values, uses the
phrase "treated as if", which seems better.

Finally, the title of the subclause could be shortened to be more
parallel to the previous subclause.


Edits to J3/08-007:

[345:23] In the title to 13.3.3 Interpretation of bit
sequences... replace "Interpretation of bit" with "Bit".

[345:26-27] In the first bullet of 13.3.3 Interpretation of bit
sequences..., replace "<boz-literal-constant is considered to be
extended" with "<boz-literal-constant> is treated as if it were
extended".

[345:30-31] In the second bullet of 13.3.3 Interpretation of bit
sequences..., replace "<boz-literal-constant is considered to be
truncated" with "<boz-literal-constant> is treated as if it were
truncated".

[345:31+] At the end of "13.3.3 Interpretation of bit seqeunces..."
add a Note:

 "Note 13.2a
   The result values of the intrinsic functions DBLE and CMPLX are
   defined by references to REAL with the same arguments. Therefore,
   the padding and truncation of <boz-literal-constant> arguments to
   those functions is the same as for REAL."
 [end Note]
