From:    David Muxworthy
Subject: UK proposal UK-12 File-unit connection
Date: 2014 June 09


Title:  File-unit connection
Status: For Consideration
Basic Functionality: Allow a file to be connected to more than one
unit at one time.

Rationale:
It can be convenient to connect a file to more than one logical unit
at one time.  Whether or not this is possible is a function of the
operating system.  It should not be prohibited in the language itself.
The programmer can determine whether or not it is possible in
particular cases by examining the output from the IOSTAT specifier in
the OPEN statement.

Specification:
Remove the prohibition on a file being connected to more than one unit
at one time.

Syntax:
No syntax change.

Edits to J3/14-007r1(= N2014):

[205:31-33] In subclause 9.5.4p4 delete ", and a file shall not be
connected to more than one unit at the same time" and append to the
end of the paragraph:

  "It is processor dependent whether a file can be connected to more
  than one unit at the same time."

[481:16+] Annex A, after "whether a unit ... C stream (9.5.4)",
    insert new bullet item
      "- whether a file can be connected to more than one unit at
         the same time (9.5.4);".
