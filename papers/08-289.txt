Subject: Five missing incompatibilities
Date: 2008 November 03

Section 1.5 of CD 1539-1 does not list some
incompatibilities.  Because the response to
Public Review Comment J32019 assures me that
the list of incompatibilities
is intended to be exhaustive, I am letting
the committee know the missing
incompatibilities I know about.  I doubt that
my list includes all of the missing
incompatibilities.

1.  the intrinsic function FRACTION

[348:13.7.63p5]

In Fortran 2003, the result of applying FRACTION
to an IEEE infinity is that IEEE infinity.  In
CD 1539-1, the result of applying FRACTION to an
IEEE infinity is a NaN.

2.  the attribute EXTERNAL

FORTRAN 77, Fortran 90, and Fortran 95 allowed an
external procedure to be declared to have the
EXTERNAL attribute within the scoping unit of its
procedure definition.  FORTRAN 77 and Fortran 90
effectively required a procedure to be explicitly
declared to have the EXTERNAL attribute if it was
to be passed as a procedure actual argument in its
own scoping unit.  Fortran 2003 prohibits declaring
a procedure from being named in an EXTERNAL statement
within the scoping unit of its procedure definition
(246:12.3.2.2l2,3 of the Fortran 2003 standard).
The CD 1539-1 specification additionally banned
an external procedure from being declared to have
the EXTERNAL attribute in a type declaration
statement (94:5.3.9p2 of CD 1539-1).

3.  the attribute INTRINSIC

Fortran 90 and Fortran 95 allowed the name of a
generic intrinsic interface to be declared to have
the INTRINSIC attribute in the same scoping unit
where that name is the name of an explicit generic
interface that contains specific interfaces that
conflict with the intrinsic interface.  The
committee ruled in an interpretation that in such
cases, the user specified interfaces took
precedence over the intrinsic.  Constraint C547 of
the Fortran 2003 standard and Constraint C542 of
CD 1539-1 prohibit the name from being declared to
have the INTRINSIC attribute in the presence of
such an explicit generic interface.

4.  printing negative zero

FORTRAN 77 and Fortran 90 required the program

    PROGRAM MAIN
      PRINT '(SS, F2.0)', -0.0
    END

to print "0.", up to possible input/output error
conditions.  A recent Fortran 2003 interpretation
ruled that a conforming processor could print "**"
for such a program.  It is unclear whether
Fortran 95 imposed the same rule as Fortran 90 or
Fortran 2003.

5.  automatic arrays

James van Buskirk pointed out on comp.lang.fortran
that the definition of an automatic array was changed
by Corrigendum 1 to the Fortran 95 standard, and again
by the Fortran 2003 standard.  Corrigendum 1 to the
Fortran 95 standard changed the definition of an
automatic array to be one where a bounds expression is
not an initialization expression.  The Fortran 2003
standard changed the definition of an initialization
expression.

The example James van Buskirk was in essence

      RECURSIVE SUBROUTINE SUBR
	INTEGER M(INT(1.0))
	SAVE
	. . .
      END

In Fortran 95, the primaries of an initialization
expression must be of type integer or character.
Therefore, in Fortran 95 as modified by Corrigendum 1,
M is an automatic array.  Since an automatic array is
not allowed to have the SAVE attribute, M does not have
the SAVE attribute in SUBR.  In Fortran 2003, the
restriction on the types of primaries in initialization
expressions was removed.  Therefore, M ceased to be an
automatic array, and so it acquired the SAVE attribute.
