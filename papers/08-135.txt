NUMBER: F03/0102
TITLE: Evaluation of bound-expr in data pointer assignment
KEYWORDS: pointer, pointer assignment, bounds, expression
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

DISCUSSION:

Currently there are no rules in 7.4.2.1 to prohibit changing of a
pointer's association status during evaluation of bound expressions
in a data pointer assignment (pointer with either bounds-spec or
bounds-remapping specified).  This may lead to ambiguous code with
regard to the evaluation orders between the bound expression and
the data pointer assignment itself.  Consider the following code,


    integer,  target  :: tar2(100, 100)
    integer,  target  :: tar1(100)
    integer,  pointer :: ptr(:,:)

    ptr(-2:, f1(ptr, tar1, 1, 1):) => tar2

    print*, lbound(ptr)
    print*, ubound(ptr)
    print*, size(ptr)

    contains

    function f1(ptr, arr, i, j)
        integer  :: i, j, f1
        integer, pointer :: ptr(:, :)
        integer, target  :: arr(:)

        ptr (i:j, i:j) => arr
        f1 = -1
    end function

    end


In 7.4.1.3 for interpretation of intrinsic assignments, there are rules
explicitly requesting evaluation of all expressions in variable occurred
before the variable is defined [139:14-19].  It appears that data pointer
assignment should also follow similar rules.

Note the similar problem also exists for evaluating the <data-target> if
it references a function that returns a data pointer.


QUESTION:

    (a) Is this program intended to be standard conforming?

    (b) If it is standard conforming, then what would it print?


ANSWER:

This program does not conform to the Fortran Standard.

The assertion that there are no rules about pointer association status
is false because changes in pointer association status necessarily
cause changes in definition status, as explained in the opening
paragraph of "16.4.2 Pointer association status" which states
  "If a pointer is associated with a target, the definition status
   of the pointer is either defined or undefined, depending on the
   definition status of the target."

The reference to F1(PTR,TAR1,1,1) executes the pointer assignment
PTR(I:J,I:J)=>ARR; this causes its actual argument PTR to become
undefined (using the quoted rule from 16.4.2).

In 7.1.8 paragraph 3, it says
  "If a function reference causes definition or undefinition of
   an actual argument of the function, that argument or any
   associated entities shall not appear elsewhere in the same
   statement."

However, PTR appears elsewhere in that statement (as the base object
of the variable in the assignment), violating this requirement.
Therefore the program is not standard-conforming.

EDITS:

None.

NOTE:

This would be clearer if the undefinition case were also added to the
list of "Events that cause variables to become undefined" in clause
16, e.g.
  "(n) When a pointer becomes associated with a target that is
       undefined, the pointer becomes undefined."
This is recommended for a future revision of the Standard.
