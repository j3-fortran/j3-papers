Discussion of issue 83 (page 332)

In addition to the exceptions noted in [331:38-40] there are other
ways in which a name that appears as a dummy argument in an ENTRY
statement might be used before the ENTRY statement.  In particular,
statement and construct entities have a scope restricted to the
statement or construct and would not interfere with a use of the same
name as a dummy argument in an ENTRY statement. The edits below intend
to fix this defect.

Edits to J3/06-007r1

[331:40] Append to the end of the sentence ", or it appears as the
name of a statement or construct entity (16.4)"
