Discussion
----------

I think I have found a glitch associated with conditional arguments.
In 15.5.1 Syntax of a procedure reference, C1539  states 
"Either all <consequent-arg>s in a <conditional-arg> shall have the 
same rank, or be assumed-rank."
and C1545 states
"In a reference to a generic procedure, each <consequent-arg> in a 
<conditional-arg> shall have the same corank, ..."
It is therefore wrong to say in 15.5.2.3 Conditional argument 
correspondence, para 4, that the corank of a <conditional-arg> is 
that of its <consequent-arg>s. This should be the case only if all the 
<consequent-arg>s have the same corank.

Edits are suggested.

[320:16] In 15.5.2.3 Conditional argument correspondence, para 4, 
sentence 1, change "rank, and corank" to "and rank", so that the 
sentence reads "The <declared type>, <kind type parameters>, and rank 
of a <conditional-arg> are those of its <consequent-arg>s."

[320:18] In 15.5.2.3 Conditional argument correspondence, at the end of
para 4, add sentence "If and only if all of its <consequent-arg>s have
the same corank, it has this corank."
