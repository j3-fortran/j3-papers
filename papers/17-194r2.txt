Discussion:
-----------

GET_TEAM is unique among ordinary intrinsics in subclause 16.9 in that
its return type, TEAM_TYPE defined in ISO_FORTRAN_ENV, is not one of
the intrinsic types, and is not the same as the type of any
non-optional dummy argument. Hence, if the result of the function
reference is assigned to variable, the type of that variable has to be
TEAM_TYPE from ISO_FORTRAN_ENV, and hence the type TEAM_TYPE has to be
accessed from that module.


Edits to WG5/N2137:
-------------------

[390:1+] At the end of 16.9.85 GET_TEAM, add a Note:

"NOTE 16.16a

Because the result type for GET_TEAM is TEAM_TYPE from the intrinsic
module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV, a program unit that assigns the result of a
reference to GET_TEAM to a local variable will also need access to the
definition of TEAM_TYPE from ISO_FORTRAN_ENV."
