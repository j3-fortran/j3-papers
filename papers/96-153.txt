Subject:   Support for C variable argument lists <stdarg.h>
Reference: WG5/N1178, WG5/N1229, (X3J3/96-069)


I would like to exchange the text concerning <stdarg.h> support which is
in N1178 (96-069) with the following solution. The current text which uses
OPTIONAL parameters on the Fortran side was a half-hearted approach, and 
will almost surely not work for general applications. 
Support of <stdarg.h> in its most general form seems to be necessary since 
some important application programming interfaces make heavy use of 
variable argument lists, e.g. all procedures with names XtVa* in the 
X Toolkit Intrinsics.

The new solution does not need a <lang-keyword> of C_STDARG, which will be
deleted from the spec of the BIND attribute in 3.1. (This also makes many 
"or BIND(C_STDARG)" clauses in the text superfluous.)

Section 3.3.2 will be replaced by the following text:

"
 3.3.2 Support for variable argument lists <stdarg.h>

 C procedures may be called with a variable number of arguments of 
 varying type. The argument list in the function prototype of such a 
 procedure must contain one or more parameters followed by an <ellipsis> 
 #...#. The called procedure may access the varying number of actual 
 arguments by facilities defined in the standard header #<stdarg.h>#.
 Fortran does not directly support this kind of procedure interfaces. 

   NOTE:
   The Fortran concept of OPTIONAL arguments is less flexible.
   It requires the specification of all possible combinations of
   arguments at compile time, including their types.

 To provide a Fortran interface to an external procedure defined by means
 of C which contains an <ellipsis>, an intrinsic module ISO_C_STDARG_H 
 shall be provided. This module shall provide access to the following:

   * A derived type definition with <type-name> C_VA_LIST.
     This type has the BIND(C) attribute and PRIVATE components.

       NOTE:
       The type C_VA_LIST defined in the Fortran binding is only used by
       the Fortran processor to build up the variable length argument list
       and pass it to the C procedure.
       It is not a translation of the C type #va-list# defined in 
       #<stdarg.h>#. This latter type and the associated macros are only 
       used in the definition of the callee, and are not required on the 
       Fortran side.

   * A named constant C_VA_EMPTY of TYPE(C_VA_LIST).
     The value of this constant shall be distinct from any value that may
     result from an argument list construction by means of OPERATOR(//).

   * ASSIGNMENT(=) for <variable>s and <expression>s of TYPE(C_VA_LIST).
     The assignment shall perform a true copying of the derived type
     components, rather than using pointer assignments and reference 
     counts.

   * An extension of the OPERATOR(//) to operands <x_1> of TYPE(C_VA_LIST).
     <x_2> may be of any type corresponding to a C data type, as specified
     in section 3.2 of this TR. The result is of TYPE(C_VA_LIST). 
     Paranteses used to specify the order of evaluation have no effect on
     the value of the result.

       EDITOR'S NOTE:
       How restrictive should the TR be on the type of <x_2>? 
       Only <basic> types? Arrays? Structures? C_VA_LIST objects???

   * A function C_VA_ARG (AP, MOLD, POS)

       Description. Extract argument of type MOLD from position POS of
                    a varying length argument list AP.

       Class. Transformational function.

       Arguments.

        AP    shall be scalar and of type C_VA_LIST. It is an INTENT(IN) 
              argument. It holds the internal representation of a varying
              length argument list.
        MOLD  shall be of any type which is valid for <x_2> in the above
              OPERATOR(//) extension. It is an INTENT(IN) argument.
        POS   shall be scalar and of type default integer, with a value
              greater than zero. It is an INTENT(IN) argument. 

       Result Characteristics. The result is of the same type and type
                               parameters as MOLD.

       Result value.
                    
       Case (i):  If the element in position POS of the varying length 
                  argument list AP has the same type and type parameters 
                  as MOLD, the result value is that of this element.
       Case (ii): Otherwise, the result value is undefined.
	      
       Elements with a value of C_VA_EMPTY are not taken into account when 
       determining the position of an element in a varying length argument 
       list AP.

       Example. If AP is C_VA_EMPTY // 5_c_int // 2.0_c_dbl // 7_c_long,
                then C_VA_ARG(AP,0.0_c_dbl,2) is of type REAL(c_dbl) and
                has the value 2.0_c_dbl.

         NOTE:
         The function C_VA_ARG is not a translation of the macro #va_arg#
         defined in #<stdarg.h>#. It accesses the Fortran processor's
         intermediate representation of the varying length argument list,
         not the C processor's representation as viewed in the callee.

 The <interface-body> that specifies a Fortran interface to a C procedure
 containing an <ellipsis> shall specify the dummy arguments as in 3.3.1, 
 and shall specify an additional dummy argument of TYPE(C_VA_LIST) in the 
 position of the <ellipsis>. INTENT shall not be specified for this 
 argument.

 To indicate an empty argument list, C_VA_EMPTY shall be used as actual
 argument in a procedure reference. To pass a non-empty list of arguments,
 C_VA_EMPTY shall be concatenated by the OPERATOR(//) with the list of
 required arguments. C_VA_EMPTY shall be the leftmost operand of this 
 concatenation, all other operands shall be specified from left to right 
 corresponding to their respective position in a C procedure reference.
 The Fortran processor translates the intermediate representation stored
 in the C_VA_LIST argument into the representation expected by the C
 processor at a procedure reference.

 If the C procedure modifies its varying arguments, the object of type
 C_VA_LIST is modified, not the operands of the OPERATOR(//) from which
 it was constructed. The modified values in a C_VA_LIST data object can 
 be extracted after the call by using the function C_VA_ARG.
