Subject: PDTS 29113 Ballot comments GB6 and GB7
From: Bill Long / Van Snyder
Date: 2011 October 11
References: WG5/N1869, WG5/N1880 WG5/N1881

Discussion:

The 7th comment (labeled here as GB7) in the UK Ballot (N1881)
proposes changing the text in 5.3.5.1, para 4 bullet list to use
Fortran terms (defined/reference) instead of "modified/accessed".  It
is unclear why the phrase "given a value" is not similarly replaced by
"defined". The edits below include that change in addition to the GB7
changes.

In reading 5.3.5.1, paragraphs 2-5 seem out of place.  For example,
paragraph 2 starts "Within a C function..." just below the 5.3.5 title
"Functions", yet the C functions of paragraph 2 are not the ones
referred to by the title.  Subclause 5.3.5.1 is clearer if paragraphs
2-5 are removed, leaving paragraphs 1, 6, and 7, all of which discuss
the actual functions that follow.  The removed paragraphs would make
more sense in a new subclause following 5.3.6.

The description in GB6 of the restriction on the actual argument
corresponding to a Fortran dummy argument is entirely unnecessary; it is
covered by subclause 5.3.10 of 1539-1.

Edits to N1869, subsuming GB6 and GB7 from N1881:

1) Replace 5.3.5.1p4 with the following

"If the address of an object is the value of a formal parameter that corresponds
to a nonpointer dummy argument in a BIND(C) interface, then

  o if the dummy argument has the INTENT(IN) argument, the object shall
    not be defined or become undefined, and

  o if the dummy argument has the INTENT(OUT) attribute, the object
    shall not be referenced before it is defined."

2) Create a new subclause, 5.3.6a, following 5.3.6 with the title
"Restrictions on formal parameters", and move 5.3.5.1 paragraphs 2, 3, 4
(as modified by edit above}, and 5 to this new subclause.

3) In the penultimate paragraph of 6.9 change "5.3.8" to "5.3.9" and
change "15.5.8" to "15.5.9".
