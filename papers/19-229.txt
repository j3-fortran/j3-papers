Introduction
------------
This paper, while trying to build upon the benefits and features of
enumeration types known generally and also stated in the above
referenced papers, attempts to document the use-cases and example code
snippets derived from extensive use of enumeration types with other
programming languages that are currently used indescribably more
widely than Fortran in chemical processing and manufacturing industry
even in engineering and scientific technical/numerical domains and
applications.  "No magic numbers in code" and type-safe programming are
among the most basic aspects of the good coding practices (GCP) sought
after by managers and technical leads toward computing in such industry.
But even in these aspects, Fortran falls short relative to other top
programming languages today and this gap compounds the reasons why Fortran
does not get considered for any large and/or new application developments.
It is therefore critically important the facility toward enumeration types
in Fortran be developed comprehensively to support a wide spectrum of
beneficial use cases in scientific and technical programming.  The section
below strives to list all the cases from industrial experience and to
extract feature requirements from these examples so that the formal
specifications toward this facility can be pursued.

Formal Requirements
-------------------
Coders want to be able to define a common type for a group of related
constant values of any particular intrinsic type as an enumeration.
The resulting enumeration type can enable the coders to work with the
constants enunerated in the type in a type-safe approach and in an
expressive manner.  These enumeration types can help coders develop
compact constructs and interfaces that help reduce program
vulnerabilities while enhancing code readability, efficiency, and
security.  The list of use cases are enumerated below.  Note they
presuppose a particular syntax for enums but that is primarily for
illustration purposes.

1) be able to define an enumeration type to group a set of named constants
   of any intrinsic type and kind:

   a) an enumeration type where the underlying type of the enumerated
      values is default integer and where the unspecified values of
      elements in the enumerator list are automatically incremented by
      unity relative to their predecessors in the enumerated list.  The
      first element, if unspecified, is implicitly given a value of 1
      e.g.,

      enum :: EOS
         enumerator :: IDEAL_GAS     !<-- Value of 1
         enumerator :: VIRIAL        !       "     2
         enumerator :: VAN_DER_WAALS !       "     3
         enumerator :: SAFT          !       "     4
         ..
      end enum

   b) default integer with int-literal-constant as an enumerated value
      e.g.,

      enum :: FLOW_REGIMES
         enumerator :: ANNULAR = 0   !<-- Value of 0
         enumerator :: SLUG_ANNULAR  !       "     1
         enumerator :: SLUG          !       "     2
         ..
      end enum

   c) integral values specified using BOZ-literal-constants e.g.,

      enum :: CALC_SPEC
         enumerator :: A = Z"0001"
         enumerator :: B = Z"0002"
         enumerator :: C = Z"0004"
         ..
      end enum

   d) values specified using a compile-time enumerable constant
      expression of elements already included in the enumerator list
      e.g.,

      enum :: CALC_SPEC
         enumerator :: A = ..
         enumerator :: B = ..
         enumerator :: C = ..
         enumerator :: ALL = A + B + C
         ..
      end enum

   d) where the underlying type of enumerators in an integer with a
      specified kind e.g.,

      enum :: MY_HASH_CODES(integer(kind=INT64))
         enumerator :: FOO = Z"d76aa478"
         enumerator :: BAR = Z"e8c7b756"
         ..
      end enum

   e) an enumeration type where the underlying type of elements in the
      enumerated list is that of the LOGICAL intrinsic type.  An example
      with the defaul logical kind is shown below though it is expected
      other supported logical kinds can be used also.

      enum :: VALVE_STATE(logical)
         enumerator :: OPEN = .true.
         enumerator :: CLOSED = .false.
      end enum

   f) an enumeration type where the underlying type of elements in the
      enumerator list is that of the CHARACTER intrinsic type. An
      example with the defaul characted kind is shown below though
      it is expected other supported character kinds can be used also.

      enum :: LNG_CONSTITUENT(character(len=*))
         enumerator :: N2 = "Nitrogen"
         enumerator :: C1 = "Methane"
         enumerator :: C2 = "Ethane"
         enumerator :: C3 = "Propane"
         ..
      end enum

   g) an enumeration type where the underlying type of elements in the
      enumerator list is that of the REAL intrinsic type.  An
      example with a user-defined kind is shown below and it is
      expected other supported real kinds can also be used similarly.

      integer, parameter :: R8 = selected_real_kind( p=12 )
      enum :: PHYS_CHEM_CONSTANTS(real(kind=R8)) ! SI units
         enumerator :: MU = 1.66053906660E-27_r8 ! Atomic mass constant
         enumerator :: NA = 6.02214076E23_r8     ! Avogadro number
         enumerator :: K = 1.380649E-23_r8       ! Boltzmann constant
         enumerator :: R = 8.314462618_r8        ! Molar gas constant
         ..
      end enum

2) that it will be possible to define and consume more than one
   enumeration types with enumerator members with the same name in a
   type-safe manner in a given scoping unit e.g.,

      enum :: EOS
         enumerator :: IDEAL
         ..
      end enum

      enum :: COMPRESSOR_EFFICIENCY_SPEC
         enumerator :: IDEAL
         ..
      end enum

3) be able to declare an object with the type of a given enumeration and
   which can then be defined using any combination of the enumerated
   values in that enumeration type, for example with reference to 1a
   above:

      type(EOS) :: EoS_Spec

4) be able to define an object of an enumeration type in assignments and
   comparison operations, for example with reference to 1a and 1b above:

      type(EOS) :: EoS_Spec
      ..
      EoS_Spec = EOS%VIRIAL
      ..
      if ( EoS_Spec == EOS%IDEAL_GAS ) then
         ..
      else if ( EoS_Spec /= EOS%SAFT ) then
         ..
      end if
      ..

      type(MY_HASH_CODES) :: Code
      ..
      if ( Code > MY_HASH_CODES%FOO ) then
         ..

      if ( Code <= MY_HASH_CODES%FOO ) then
         ..

5) be able to use an object of an enumeration type in a SELECT CASE
   construct, for example with reference to 1b above:

      type(CALC_SPEC) :: CalcSpec
      ..
      select case ( CalcSpec )
         case ( CALC_SPEC%A )
            ..
         case ( CALC_SPEC%B, CALC_SPEC%C )
            ..
         ..
      end select

6) be able to work with a variable of an enumeration type or an enumerator
   element in an enumeration type in a convenient manner:

   a) be able to pass a variable of an enumeration type or an enumerator
      element in an enumeration type to any intrinsic procedure as
      applicable based on TKR matching requirements in the standard for
      argument association that is perfomed relative to the underlying
      type of the enumeration e.g.,

      i) ACHAR, BTEST, BIT_SIZE, CHAR, IAND, IOR, etc. functions when the
         underlying type of the argument of enumerator type is integral,
      ii) ABS through TINY when the underlying type of the argument of
          enumerator type is real,
      iii) functions such as LOGICAL when the underlying type of the
           argument of enumerator type is logical,
      iv) functions such as TRIM, LEN, LEN_TRIM when the underlying type
          of the argument of enumerator type is character

   a) "cast" the enumerator value to an object of an intrinsic type using
       the intrinsic conversion functions e.g.,

      i) INT intrinsic
         type(MY_HASH_CODES) :: code
         integer(INT64) :: foo
         ..
         code = MY_HASH_CODES%FOO
         ..
         foo = int( code, kind=kind(foo) )
         ..

      ii) REAL intrinsic
          real, parameter :: Rgas=real(PHYS_CHEM_CONSTANTS%R, kind(Rgas))

      iii) elided are the uses with LOGICAL and CHAR intrinsic functions

   b) directly employ the enumerator values as indices in loop constructs
      *provided* the underlying type of the enumeration is integral e.g.,

      i) DO loop
         ! consider an enum LOOP_IDX of default integer as underlying type
         enum LOOP_IDX
            ! MY_RANGE, N are named constants defined previously
            enumerator :: BEGIN = -MY_RANGE
            enumerator :: END   = +MY_RANGE
            enumerator :: INCR  = MY_RANGE/N
         end enum
         do I = LOOP_IDX%BEGIN, LOOP_IDX%END [ , LOOP_IDX%INCR ]
            ..
         end do

      ii) DO CONCURRENT (and FORALL?)
         ! consider an enum FOR_ALL of integer(INT64) as underlying type
         do concurrent( I = FOR_ALL%IDX1 : FOR_ALL%IDXN [ : FOR_ALL%IDXI ]
            ..
         end do

   c) utilize the MAX, MIN intrinsic functions with variables and elements
      of an enumeration type where the result value is the enumerator
      corresponding to that determined by the function operating on the
      values of the arguments: e.g.,

      type(CALC_SPEC) :: CalcSpec
      ..
      read(..) .., CalcSpec, ..
      ..
      CalcSpec = max( CalcSpec, CALC_SPEC%B )

7) be able to define a variable of an enumeration type with a value that
   can be generated using a valid expression on one or more enumerator
   elements of that enumeration type e.g., with reference to 1c above

      type(CALC_SPEC) :: CalcSpec
      ..
      CalcSpec = CALC_SPEC%ALL
      ..
      CalcSpec = ior( CalcSpec, CALC_SPEC%B )
      ..
      CalcSpec = CALC_SPEC%B + CALC_SPEC%C

8) be able to define a named constant of an enumeration type e.g., with
   reference to 1b above

      type(FLOW_REGIMES), parameter :: SLUG_FLOW = FLOW_REGIMES%SLUG

9) that it will be possible for an enumeration type to be the selector in
   an ASSOCIATE construct e.g., with reference to 1g above,

   type(PHYS_CHEM_CONSTANTS) :: k
   ..
   associate ( CONST => PHYS_CHEM_CONSTANTS )
      ..
      k = CONST%k
      ..
   end associate

10) that it is possible for an enumerator to be the selector in an
    ASSOCIATE construct e.g., with reference to 1e above,

    associate ( foo => MY_HASH_CODES%FOO )
       ..
    end associate

    associate ( R => real(PHYS_CHEM_CONSTANTS%R, kind=..) )
       ..
       Density = P/R/T
       ..
    end associate

11) be able to define a component of a derived type that is of an
    enumeration type with the option to include default initialization
    for that component e.g., with respect to 1e above

    type :: valve_t
       ..
       type(VALVE_STATE) :: vs [ = VALVE_STATE%CLOSED ]
       ..
    end type

12) be able to define a type parameter of a derived type that is of an
    enumeration type with the option to include default initialization
    for that type parameter e.g., a kind-type parameter with respect to 1a
    above

    type :: Eos_t(EosKind)
       type(EOS), kind :: EosKind [ = EOS%VAN_DER_WAALS ]
       ..
    end type

13) be able to utilize an enumeration type as part of procedure
    characteristics, for example with reference to 1b above,

    a) type of an argument in a procedure

       subroutine CalcPressureDrop( .., ValveState, .. )

          ! Argument list
          ..
          type(VALVE_STATE), intent(in) :: ValveState
          ..
          if ( ValveState == VALVE_STATE%OPEN ) then
          ..
       end subroutine
       ..
       type(VALVE_STATE) :: vs
       ..
       vs = VALVE_STATE%CLOSED
       ..
       call CalcPressureDrop( .., vs, ..)

    b) type of a function result

       function GetKeyConstituent( .. ) result(r)

          ! Argument list
          ..
          ! Function result
          type(LNG_CONSTITUENT) :: r

          r = LNG_CONSTITUENT%C1
          ..
          if ( .. ) then
             r = LNG_CONSTITUENT%C2
          else
             r = LNG_CONSTITUENT%C3
          end if

       end GetKeyConstituent

    c) resolution of generic interfaces

14) be able to access enumeration types via USE association in a given
    scoping unit which then also provides access to all the enumerator
    constants in that enumeration type,

15) be able to access enumeration types via IMPORT statements in a
    relevant scoping unit which then also provides access to all the
    enumerator constants in that enumeration type, as applicable.

16) that there is a mechanism available to determine the number of
    enumerators in an enumerator type, perhaps in the form of a new
    intrinsic function,
    say NumEnums, which has a dummy argument that is of an enumeration
    type or via the existing SIZE intrinsic.

17) that there is a mechanism available to fetch the values of all the
    enumerators in an enumerator type, perhaps in the form of a new
    intrinsic function, say GetEnumValues, which has a dummy argument that
    is of an enumeration type and whose result is an array of the
    enumerator values listed sequentially with the array being of the same
    type as the underlying type of the enumeration type.

18) that there is a mechanism available to fetch the names of all the
    enumerators in an enumerator type, perhaps in the form of a new
    intrinsic function, say GetEnumNames, which has a dummy argument that
    is of an enumeration type and whose result is an array of the
    enumerator names listed sequentially with the array being of default
    CHARACTER type and a length that of the enumerator name with the
    maximum length.

19) that there is a mechanism available to fetch the value of an
    enumerator in an enumerator type based either on the name of the
    enumerator or its relative position in the enumerated list.  This can
    perhaps be in the form of a new intrinsic function, say GetEnumValue,
    which is a generic interface to 2 functions, the first dummy argument
    of both being the enumeration type of interest while the second
    argument of one is the name of the enumerator whereas it is a position
    index of the enumerator in the case of the second.  The result of
    these functions is a scalar corresponding to the enumerator value and
    whose type is that of the underlying type of the enumeration type.

20) that there is a mechanism available to fetch the name of an enumerator
    in an enumerator type based either on the value of the enumerator or
    its relative position in the enumerated list.  This can perhaps be in
    the form of a new intrinsic function, say GetEnumName, which is a
    generic interface to 2 functions, the first dummy argument of both
    being the enumeration type of interest while the second argument of
    one is the value of the enumerator whereas it is a position index of
    the enumerator in the case of the second.  The result of these
    functions is a scalar of character type corresponding to the name of
    the enumerator.

21) that there is a mechanism to perform output editing of a variable of
    an enumeration type using i) list-directed formatting, ii) using
    character editing as a data edit descriptor for formatted output, and
    iii) using namelist formatting.  The output shall be the name of the
    enumerator corresponding to the variable.

22) that there is a mechanism to perform input editing of a variable of an
    enumeration type using i) list-directed formatting, ii) using
    character editing as a data edit descriptor for formatted output, and
    iii) using namelist formatting.  The input shall be the name of the
    enumerator corresponding to the variable.

Formal Specification
--------------------

Syntax
------
Though this paper does not attempt to develop syntax toward an enumeration
type in Fortran, it presupposes certain aspects of it but which, as
explained above, is for illustration purposes only in connection with
example snippets of pseudocode.  The author hopes the eventual syntax
toward enumeration types will not only be one that integrates well with
the current Fortran language standard but that any new syntactical
aspects or keywords or instructions introduced in the language as part of
this facility will be relatable to good coding practices followed
currently using other prominent languages in modern codes toward
scientific, technical, and numerical computing.  An example of this would
be the consideration to retain the existing keyword ENUM for the new
enumeration type.  And similarly to the concept of "scoped" and "unscoped"
enumeration in some other languages, Fortran can perhaps consider
"unnamed" and "named" enumerations, meaning one that has the BIND(C)
attribute and thus does not have a name and nor an emueration type:

   enum, bind(C)
      enumerator :: UP = 1, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT
   end enum

and another which defines a new type and a name e.g.,

   enum :: PARTICLE_MOVEMENT
      enumerator :: UP = 1, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT
   end enum

Thus 'UP' and 'PARTICLE_MOVEMENT%UP' refer to 2 different types, the
former being effectively a named constant of INTEGER(C_INT) type whereas
the latter is distinct as the PARTICLE_MOVEMENT enumeration type.
