Subject: Baroque spelling of 'WITH' functionality

This is a re-issue of 99-171 with the typographical errors corrected and the
edits revised to apply to 99-007r2.

1. Introduction

The editor has called to our attention that people who are not using extensible
types will not think of looking in SELECT TYPE to find the ASSOCIATE facility.
The syntax is also weird and inconvenient - "SELECT TYPE" and "TYPE DEFAULT are
misleading.

Therefore we propose that a separate (but very similar) construct should be
used for accessing the ASSOCIATE facility when type-selection is not required.

2. Syntax

   ASSOCIATE ( <associate-name> => <expr> [ , <associate-name> => <expr> ]... )
     ...
   END ASSOCIATE

Each <associate-name> is a construct entity that has the scope of the ASSOCIATE
block, just like the <associate-name> in a SELECT TYPE.

For consistency, we should change our existing
   SELECT TYPE ( <expr> ) [ ASSOCIATE( <name> ) ]
to
   SELECT TYPE ( [ <name> => ] <expr> )

3. Examples

Before these changes, an example might look like this:

   TYPE(MYTYPE) AX,AY
   ...
   SELECT TYPE ( AX%B(I,J)%D ) ASSOCIATE ( ZX )
   TYPE DEFAULT
     SELECT TYPE ( AY%B(I,J)%D ) ASSOCIATE ( ZY )
     TYPE DEFAULT
       W = ZX*X + ZY*Y
     END SELECT
   END SELECT

After these changes, it would look like this:

   TYPE(MYTYPE) AX,AY
   ...
   ASSOCIATE ( ZX => AX%B(I,J)%D, ZY => AY%B(I,J)%D )
     W = ZX*X + ZY*Y
   END ASSOCIATE

4. Discussion

Given this construct, it no longer makes sense to allow SELECT TYPE on non-
polymorphic expressions; therefore we limit SELECT TYPE to polymorphic exprs.

5. Edits

{Add the ASSOCIATE construct to the list of executable constructs}
[11:2+] Add new line "<<or>> <associate-construct>".

{Allow the blank between END and ASSOCIATE to be omitted}
[27:33+] Add new line "END ASSOCIATE".

{Change SELECT TYPE syntax to be consistent with new ASSOCIATE}
[172:24-25] Change "( <type-selector>) [ ASSOCIATE ( <associate-name> ) ]"
            To     "( [ <associate-name> => ] <type-selector> )".

{Require the SELECT TYPE type-selector to be polymorphic.}
[172:30+] Add new constraint
"Constraint: <type-selector> shall be polymorphic."

{Since we only allow polymorphic expressions in SELECT TYPE, TYPE IS should
require an extensible type name.  This also fixes the <type-name> problem.}
[172:31] Change "<type-name>" to "<extensible-type-name>"

{SELECT TYPE type-selector is polymorphic, so the associate-name in the
TYPE DEFAULT block is polymorphic}
[173:31] After "name" insert "is polymorphic and"
[173:32-33] Delete "; it is ... polymorphic"

{Delete old example}
[174:37-43] Delete.

{Add new syntax}
[174:43+] Insert new section and renumber existing 8.1.5
"8.1.5 ASSOCIATE construct

The ASSOCIATE construct associates a name with an expression during the
execution of its block.

8.1.5.1  Form of the ASSOCIATE construct

R820a <associate-construct> <<is>> <associate-stmt>
                                   <block>
                                   <end-associate-stmt>

R820b <associate-stmt> <<is>> [ <associate-construct-name> : ] &
                              ASSOCIATE ( <association> &
                              [ , <association> ]... )

R820c <association> <<is>> <associate-name> => <selector>
Constraint: If <selector> is not a <variable> or is a <variable> that has a
            vector subscript, <associate-name> shall not appear in a variable
            definition context (14.7.7).

R820d <selector> <<is>> <expr>
                 <<or>> <variable>

R820e <end-associate-stmt> <<is>> END ASSOCIATE [ <associate-construct-name> ]

Constraint: If the <associate-stmt> of an <associate-construct> specifies an
            <associate-construct-name>, the corresponding <end-associate-stmt>
            shall specify the same <associate-construct-name>.  If the
            <associate-stmt> of an <associate-construct> does not specify an
            <associate-construct-name>, the corresponding <end-associate-stmt>
            shall not specify an <associate-construct-name>.

8.1.5.2 Execution of the ASSOCIATE construct

Execution of an ASSOCIATE construct causes execution of its block.  During
execution of that block each associate name is associated (14.6.1.4) with the
corresponding selector.  The associate name assumes the type, type parameters,
rank, and bounds of the selector.  The associate name is polymorphic if and
only if the selector is polymorphic.  If the selector is allocatable it shall
be currently allocated; the associate name does not have the ALLOCATABLE
attribute.  If the selector is a pointer it shall be associated; the associate
name is associated with the target of the pointer and does not have the POINTER
attribute.

J3 note:
The interaction between ASYNCHRONOUS or VOLATILE and the ASSOCIATE or SELECT
TYPE construct needs to be described.

If a selector is a <variable> other than an array section having a vector
subscript, the associate name is associated with that data object and is
definable if and only if the <variable> is definable.  Otherwise the associate
name has the value of the selector, which is evaluated prior to execution of
the block, and is not definable.

Note 8.13x
The association between the associate name and a data object is established
prior to execution of the block and is not affected by subsequent changes to
variables that were used in subscripts or substring ranges in the <selector>.

It is permissible to branch to an END ASSOCIATE statement only from within the
ASSOCIATE construct.

8.1.5.3 Examples of the ASSOCIATE construct

Note 8.14
The following example illustrates an association with an expression.

ASSOCIATE ( Z => EXP(-(X**2+Y**2)) * COS(THETA) )
  PRINT *, A+Z, A-Z
END ASSOCIATE

Note 8.15
The following example illustrates an association with a derived-type variable.

ASSOCIATE ( XC => AX%B(I,J)%C )
  XC%DV = XC%DV + PRODUCT(XC%EV(1:N))
END ASSOCIATE

Note 8.16
The following example illustrates association with an array section.

ASSOCIATE ( ARRAY => AX%B(I,:)%C )
  ARRAY(N)%EV = ARRAY(N-1)%EV
END ASSOCIATE

Note 8.17
The following example illustrates multiple associations.

ASSOCIATE ( W => RESULT(I,J)%W, ZX => AX%B(I,J)%D, ZY => AY%B(I,J)%D )
  W = ZX*X + ZY*Y
END ASSOCIATE
".

{Add associate-name information to 14.1.3 "Statement and construct entities"}
[368:30+] Insert
"The associate name of an ASSOCIATE construct has a scope of the construct.  It
has the declared type, dynamic type, type parameters, rank and bounds specified
in 8.1.5.2."

{Explain hiding of any outer name.}
[368:31-32] After "SELECT TYPE" insert "or ASSOCIATE" twice.

{Add association information to ch14}
[371:47+] Insert
"Execution of an ASSOCIATE statement establishes an association between each
selector and the corresponding associate name of the ASSOCIATE construct.  If
the selector is a variable other than an array section having a vector
subscript, the association is to the data object specified by the selector;
otherwise, the association is to the value of the selector expression.  The
associate name remains associated to its selector throughout the execution of
the construct.  Within the ASSOCIATE construct, each selector is known by and
may be accessed by its associate name.  Upon termination of the ASSOCIATE
construct, the association is terminated.".
