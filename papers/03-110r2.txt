Subject: Edits for polymorphic association

Summary 

Polymorphic objects of CLASS(My_Type) need to occasionally be used in
places where a  non-polymorphic object of the declared type
TYPE(My_Type) is needed. The present standard  allows these to be
intermixable in certain occasions, such as argument association (see
265:6) and assignment (see 139:8, and also 73:35), but not in others,
notably, in pointer  assignment (see 143:1). This is very evidently an
inconsistency and needs to be fixed.

The problem: one cannot at present do: 

TYPE(base_type), POINTER :: non_polymorphic 
CLASS(base_type), POINTER :: polymorphic

non_polymorphic=>polymorphic 

because of C716.

The following edits also allow for pointer and argument association between a 
nonpolymorphic object and the appropriate component of a nonpolymorphic object.


Edits

56:20 (of J3/03-166). Add at line end 'An <<ancestor component>> of an object is 
the parent component of the object or an ancestor component of the parent 
component.'

142:35: Delete C716 (C717 at 143:1 is enough)

143:30-. Add paragraph 'If <data-pointer-object> is not polymorphic and <data-
target> is polymorphic with dynamic type that differs from its declared type, 
the assignment target is the ancestor component of <data-target> that has the 
type of <data-pointer-object>. Otherwise, the assignment target is <data-
target>.'

143:30 Change second '<data-target>' to 'the assignment target'. 

143:32 Change 'the same object' to 'the assignment target'. 

265:10. Add at line end 'If the dummy argument is neither allocatable nor a 
pointer and if the actual argument is polymorphic with dynamic type that differs 
from its declared type, the dummy argument is associated with the ancestor 
component of the actual argument that has the type of the dummy argument.'
