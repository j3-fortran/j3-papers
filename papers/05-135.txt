With large modules with many names, perhaps long names, it
may be difficult, unclear or inconvenient to use most of the names
present while excluding a few (perhaps to prevent collisions).
Adding a NOT clause to the USE statement solves the problem.

This feature is proposed in response to an informal Fortran 2003
comment from Australia (no formal comment was received).

At 167 the Hate .. Love vote was 1 - 1 - 8 - 2.
The difficulty on the John Reid scale was 4.

Title: USE NOT:

Submitted By: J3

Status: For Consideration

References: J3/03-106, J3/04-114

Basic Functionality: A syntax to list names not to have use association
                     when using a module.

Rationale:  When using a module with many public names, a few may be
            unwanted.  Specifying those few is easier than naming
            the many wanted names, and less ugly than fanciful renames.

Estimated Impact: 4 on the John Reid scale at 167

Detailed Specification: Add a clause to the USE statement
                        specifying names not available via use association.

                        If NOT: <list> is present, ONLY is not, and
                        there are no renames.  (It makes no sense
                        to say "don't use this name, and call it 'foo'".
