This was raised before, though I cannot remember where, but seems to
have been forgotten.  CFI_cdesc_to_bounds is either trivial or almost
unimplementable.  The problem is what it returns for the strides.  There
are two possible interpretations:

    1) One is that it returns the strides as would be used in an array
section to recreate the array, and that is almost unimplementable and
would need a lot of wordsmithing to turn it into a specification.
The killer is that Fortran supports some pretty weird shapes of array.
Here is one example that would cause trouble:

    PROGRAM Main
        INTERFACE
            SUBROUTINE Hyrax (kit) BIND(C)
                REAL(KIND=KIND(0.0D0)) :: kit(:,:)
            END SUBROUTINE Hyrax
        END INTERFACE
        TYPE :: Coney
            REAL(KIND=KIND(0.0D0)) :: x
            REAL :: y
        END TYPE Coney
        TYPE(Coney) :: rabbit(20,20)
        CALL Hyrax(TRANSPOSE(rabbit(3:18:5,5:19:7)%x))
    END PROGRAM Main

    2) The other is that it returns the strides in terms of element
count rather than bytes, and that is trivial.  Most C programmers will
simply code the calculations inline, because they will usually need only
one of the fields (almost always the upper bound).  Here is a complete
and portable implementation to show how easy it is:

    int CFI_cdesc_to_bounds ( const CFI_cdesc_t * cdesc,
            CFI_bounds_t bounds[] ) {
        int i;
        CFI_index_t x;
        if (cdesc->base_addr == NULL) return 1;
        for (i = 0; i < cdesc->rank; ++i) {
            bounds[i].lower_bound = x = cdesc->dim[i].lower_bound;
            bounds[i].upper_bound = (cdesc->dim[i].extent-1)+x;
            bounds[i].stride = cdesc->dim[i].sm/cdesc->elem_size;
        }
        return 0;
    }

For these reasons, the function should simply be removed.
