INTRODUCTION

This part of ISO/IEC 1539 has been prepared by ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG5,
the technical working group for the Fortran language.  This part of
ISO/IEC 1539 is an auxiliary standard to ISO/IEC 1539 : 1996, which
defines the latest revision of the Fortran language, and is the first
part of the multipart Fortran family of standards; this part of
ISO/IEC 1539 is the third part.  The revised language defined by the
above standard is informally known as Fortran 95.

This part of ISO/IEC 1539 defines a conditional compilation language
definition.

References to Part 1 refer to "ISO/IEC 1539 : 1996, Information
technology--Programming Languages--Fortran."

GENERAL
Frequently Fortran programmers need to maintain more than one version
of a code, or to run the code in various environments. The easiest
solution for the programmer is to keep a single source file that has
all the code variations interleaved within it so that any version can
be easily extracted. This way, modifications that apply to all versions
need only be made once.

Conditional compilation permits the programmer to define special
variables and logical constucts that conditionally control which
source lines in the file are passed on to the compiler and which
lines are skipped over.

There are many uses for conditional compilation.  Writing portable
code is one of the most popular uses of conditional compilation.
Examples in Annex A show some other uses for conditional compilation.

3. THE CONDITIONAL COMPILATION LANGUAGE DEFINITION
{{{ Supplied in the paper distribution }}}

Annex A : EXAMPLES

This annex includes two examples illustrating the use of facilities
conformant with this part of ISO/IEC 1539.

The first example uses conditional compilation to facilitate the
editing of a large block comment.

The second example uses conditional compilation to provide
debugging information upon entering and exiting procedures.
Note, the conditional compilation directives in this example
could be automatically generated.

Each example contains a conditional compilation program and an
output file that results from conditional compilation processing.

--- initial text ------------------------------------------
! EXAMPLE 1 shows the Shift file for output
?? logical :: modifying_header_comment = .false.
??  if (.not. modifying_header_comment) then

One convenient use of conditional compilation is the
ability to write large comments that span across many
lines without requiring each line to start with a "!".
Since conditional compilation specifies blocks of lines
to be skipped over by the compiler, this whole paragraph
can be written and modified without the overhead of
making sure that each line is a Fortran comment.

One can imagine this use of conditional compilation for
header comments preceding Fortran programs, modules and
procedures.
