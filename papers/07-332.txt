Discussion

The editor points out a contradiction between the first and second
paragraphs of 14.9. The sentence in TR 15580 that corresponds to the
second paragraph of 14.9 is
  "For each of the other arithmetic operators and for each implemented
  IEEE rounding mode, the result shall be as specified in the IEEE
  standard whenever the operands and IEEE result are normalized."
Here, "other" means other than divide. What is missing in 14.9 is
"and for each implemented IEEE rounding mode". We propose that this
be restored.

The editor is also critical of the words at the end of the second
paragraph of 14.9, which are unnecessary in view of 7.1.5.2.1. These
words were not present in TR 15580. We think that they should be
deleted.


Edit to 07-007r3

[436:24-26] In 14.9 IEEE arithmetic, replace the second paragraph by
   "For each of the operations of addition, subtraction, and
   multiplication, and for each implemented IEEE rounding mode,
   the result shall be as specified in the IEEE International
   Standard whenever the operands and IEEE result are normalized."
