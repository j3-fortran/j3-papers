=====

[136:32+] 8.7p3+ IMPLICIT statement

Insert a new P3+

Default mapping, for a letter where no mapping is specified,
is obsolescent.

[601:3+]

Insert new subclause:

B.3.yy Default implicit typing

Default implicit typing is a significant source of programming
errors and has been superseded by explicit typing. The IMPLICIT
statement can also be used to specify mapping for initial letters
of identifiers.

--END--
