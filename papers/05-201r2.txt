1. Detailed specification

Allow TYPE(<intrinsic-type>) to specify an intrinsic type.

2. Edits

[71:9-12] Insert a second alternative into <declaration-type-spec> (R502)
"                             <<or>> TYPE ( <intrinsic-type-spec> )"
giving
"R502 <declaration-type-spec> <<is>> <intrinsic-type-spec>
                              <<or>> TYPE ( <intrinsic-type-spec> )
                              <<or>> TYPE ( <derived-type-spec> )
                              <<or>> CLASS ( <derived-type-spec> )
                              <<or>> CLASS ( * )
"

[75:7] Within the first paragraph of 5.1.1.1 TYPE replace "a derived" by

[39:17] At the beginning of the third paragraph of 4.4.3 Complex Type -- the
one that begins "The type specifier for the complex type..." -- replace "The
