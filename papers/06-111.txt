Subj:   J3 Fortran interp letter ballot #12 - due 3-Feb-2006

Enclosed in the twelfth letter ballot on Fortran interpretations.

The rules by which we operate say:

    o   J3 votes on the answer at a J3 meeting; a simple majority
        vote marks the answer as "passed by J3 meeting".

    o   Between J3 meetings the chair of /interp sends a J3 letter
        ballot to J3 to approve interp answers that have been "passed
        by J3 meeting".  The letter ballot runs for 30 days.  Not
        voting on three of four consecutive J3 letter ballots is
        grounds to terminate J3 membership.  An interp answer passes
        by a 2/3rds vote;  a no vote must be accompanied by an
        explanation of the changes necessary to change the member's
        vote to yes.

        J3/interp reserves the right to recall an interp answer for
        more study even if the answer passes.

17 Fortran 2003 interpretations are currently "Passed by J3 meeting"
after J3 meeting #174.  This is the letter ballot phase to go from
"Passed by J3 meeting" to "Passed by J3 letter ballot".

The following Fortran interpretations are being balloted:

NUMBER: F03/0028
TITLE: Commas in complex namelist output
KEYWORDS: Namelist, complex formatting, comma, semicolon
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

The 7th paragraph in 10.9.2 for list directed output says:

"Complex constants are enclosed in parentheses with a
separator between the real and imaginary parts, each
produced as defined above for real constants. The separator
is a comma if the decimal edit mode is POINT; it is a
semicolon if the decimal edit mode is COMMA."

There are similar words in most other places where complex
formatting is described.

The second paragraph of 10.10.1.3 Namelist group object list
items says:

"When the next effective item is of type complex, the input
form of the input value consists of a left parenthesis
followed by an ordered pair of numeric input fields
separated by a comma and followed by a right parenthesis. "

Other places correctly describe namelist complex output as
having a separator, either a comma or a semicolon, depending
on the decimal edit mode.

Should the namelist version be reworded to say "comma or
semicolon"?

ANSWER:

Yes.  Edits are supplied to correct this oversight.
In addition, a similar issue exists for list directed input of
undelimited character values and namelist output of character
values.

EDITS:

All edits refer to 04-007.

[240:13] Replace "comma" with "comma (if the decimal edit mode is
         POINT), semicolon (if the decimal edit mode is COMMA)"

[244:29] Replace "comma" with "separator".
[244:30] Before "The first", add the following sentence:
           The separator is a comma if the decimal edit mode is
           POINT; it is a semicolon if the decimal edit mode is
           COMMA.
[244:32] Replace "comma" with "separator".
[244:33] Replace "comma" with "separator".

[245:4] after "comma," insert " semicolon,"

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

MODULE m
  TYPE t
    INTEGER :: i
  CONTAINS
    FINAL :: finalizeT
  END TYPE
CONTAINS
  ELEMENTAL SUBROUTINE finalizeT(f)
    TYPE(t), INTENT(INOUT) :: f
    f%i = 10
  END SUBROUTINE
END MODULE

SUBROUTINE xyz (d)
  USE m
  TYPE(t), INTENT(OUT) :: d(*)
END SUBROUTINE

PROGRAM foo
  USE m
  EXTERNAL xyz
  TYPE(t) :: a(10) = t(5)
  CALL xyz(a(2))
END PROGRAM

4.5.5.2 of Fortran 2003 states:
    When a procedure is invoked, a nonpointer, nonallocatable object
    that is an actual argument associated with an INTENT(OUT) dummy
    argument is finalized.

For assumed-size arguments, this situation is similar to that of
default initialization with INTENT(OUT).  Default initialization is
prohibited for INTENT(OUT), assumed-size dummy arguments by C544.  A
similar restriction on finalization may have been overlooked.

Was this program intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

No, this program was not intended to be standard-conforming.  An edit
is supplied to correct this oversight.

DISCUSSION:

The unstated philosophy of assumed-size arrays in the standard is that
no action is allowed on an assumed-size array which would need to be
applied elementally to the whole array.  That is why no whole array
assignment is allowed, for example.

In accordance with this philosophy,
(1) types with ultimate allocatable components also need to be
    excluded from being INTENT(OUT) assumed-size, as procedure
    invocation in this case requires deallocation of all the
    allocated components.

(2) polymorphic INTENT(OUT) assumed-size arrays should also be
    excluded, as they might have finalisation, default initialisation
    or allocatable components.

This interp subsumes Fortran 2003 interp #0060.

The following is given as input to this program:

1044 2167 3977 /
1 2 3


10.9.1.1 of Fortran 2003 (Null values) states:

    A slash encountered as a value separator during execution of a
    list-directed input statement causes termination of execution of
    that input statement after the assignment of the previous value.

If a child data transfer statement encounters a slash as a value
separator, it is unclear whether this statement applies to just the
child statement, or to the parent data transfer statement as well.
The significance for any subsequent child statement is also unclear.

What is the behaviour of this program when it is given the specified
input?


ANSWER:

When a child data transfer statement encounters a slash as a value
separator, only that data transfer statement encounters the slash.
None of its parent data transfer statements encounters the slash.
Only the data transfer statement that encounters the slash is
terminated.

The program above should print the following:
 1044.2167.3977.25.1.2.3
where "." represents a value separator.

QUESTION:

Can namelist I/O ever invoke a user-defined derived-type I/O
procedure?

10.10.1.2 of Fortran 2003 (Namelist input values) implies that
namelist input cannot invoke a user-defined derived-type I/O
procedure.  It says that, for a derived-type variable, "the effect is
as if the variable represented were expanded into a sequence of scalar
list items of intrinsic data types", which would preclude any
derived-type I/O.

However, the same sentence says that this is done "in the same way
that formatted input/output list items are expanded (9.5.2)", which
would result in some effective list items of derived type.

9.5.3.6 and 9.5.3.7.2 also imply that a user-defined derived-type I/O
procedure could be invoked for a namelist group object.


ANSWER:

Yes, namelist I/O can invoke a user-defined derived-type I/O
procedure.  Edits are provided to correct this problem.

C544 prevents nonpolymorphic, INTENT(OUT), assumed-size arrays from

Consider the following program:

        END TYPE
      CONTAINS
        SUBROUTINE abc (b)
          CLASS(t1) :: b(*)
          EXTERNAL xyz
          CALL xyz(b(2))
        END SUBROUTINE
      END MODULE

      SUBROUTINE xyz(d)
        USE m
        TYPE(t1) :: d(2,3)
      END SUBROUTINE

      PROGRAM foo
        USE m
        TYPE, EXTENDS(t1) :: t2
          INTEGER :: j
        END TYPE
        TYPE(t2) a(10)
        CALL abc(a(2))
      END PROGRAM

During the execution of "xyz", the dummy argument "d" is sequence
associated with the associated actual argument (which is true if "d"
has either explicit shape or assumed size).  This implies that the
entity that is argument associated with "d" must be contiguous.

The dummy argument "b" of the module subroutine "abc" is polymorphic,
and its dynamic type in this case is different than its declared type.
In this scoping unit, "xyz" has an implicit interface, so we know it
doesn't have any polymorphic arguments.  So, the dummy argument of
"xyz" must be nonpolymorphic, and have the same declared type as the
actual argument (b(2)).

This implies that we only want to pass the parent portion of b(2).
But the dummy argument of "xyz" may be an explicit-shape or
assumed-size array (in this case, it is an explicit-shape array).

This means that we have to pass a contiguous array to "xyz".  This
wouldn't be a problem if the dynamic type of "b" was the same as the
declared type, but in this case it is not.  The parent portion of "b"
(from element 2 to the end of the array) must be copied into a
temporary array.

The compiler cannot possibly know how big "b" is because it is an
assumed-size array, so it is impossible to make such a copy.

Was this program intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

No, this program was not intended to be standard-conforming.  Edits
are provided to correct this oversight.

QUESTION:

It is clear that procedure pointers are permitted in common blocks.
However, due to the restrictions on BLOCK DATA program units, it seems
that such a common block can not appear in a BLOCK DATA program unit.

Was it intended that common blocks containing procedure pointers could
be initialized in a BLOCK DATA program unit?

ANSWER:

Yes, it was intended that common blocks containing procedure pointers
could be initialized in a BLOCK DATA program unit.  Edits are provided

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

      PROGRAM foo
        PROCEDURE(sub) :: p
        INTERFACE
          SUBROUTINE sub(p2)
            IMPORT p
            PROCEDURE(p) :: p2
          END SUBROUTINE
        END INTERFACE
      END PROGRAM

C1212 appears to prohibit the case of an interface name in a procedure
declaration statement being the name of something declared in a later
procedure declaration statement.  But it does not appear to prohibit
the case of an interface name being the name of something declared in
a later interface body.

In the above program, the characteristics of p rely on the
characteristics of sub.  The characteristics of sub, in turn, rely on
the characteristics of p.

Is this program standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

No, this program is not standard-conforming.  The interface name in a
procedure declaration statement should not be permitted to be declared
in a later interface body.  An edit is supplied to correct this
oversight.

STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Given
  REAL X
  X = ... some value ...
  IF( (X+3.0) .EQ. 3.0 )...  
may the X+3.0 be computed with more range and/or precision than that
of REAL?  In other words, is PRECISION(X) .EQ. PRECISION(X+3.0) always
true; or is PRECISION(X) .LT. PRECISION(X+3.0) sometimes true?

References are to J3/04-007.

2.4.1.1 Intrinsic type has "The kind type parameter indicates ... the
decimal precision and exponent range for the real and complex types,
..."

7.1.4.2 Type, type parameters, and shape of the result of an operation
has in (4) "For an expression x1 op x2 where op is a numeric intrinsic
binary operator with both operands of the same type and kind type
parameters, ..., the kind type parameter of the expression is
identical to that of each operand."

Since X and 3.0 are the same type and have the same kind type
parameters, 7.1.4.2 (4) appears to require the X+3.0 have just the
range and precision of REAL; no more, no less (otherwise, the
precision is not identical).  But, several members of the J3 email
list have said that the "+" may be done with more precision; using
either 1.4(6) or 7.1.8.3 as the reason.

Perhaps something alone the lines of "The values of floating operands
and of the results of floating expressions may be represented in
greater precision and range than that required by the kind type
parameter; the kind type parameter is not changed thereby." should be
added to 7.1.4.2(4).

QUESTION:

Is PRECISION(X) .EQ. PRECISION(X+3.0) always true? 

ANSWER:

Yes, that is the definition of PRECISION.  The PRECISION intrinsic has
nothing to do with the precision in which the computation X+3.0 is
computed.  7.1.4.2 (4) only describes the precision of the end result
of the computation.

The weasel words in 1.4 (6) allow the processor to compute this expression
in higher precision than REAL.

TITLE: Accuracy of conversion of real literal constants
KEYWORDS: conversion, accuracy
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

The following is independent of IEEE-754.

Fortran 2003 10.6.1.2.6 covers conversions between "decimal values"
and "internal values" and has some strong requirements.

Are there equivalent requirements on accuracy for conversions of real
literal constants?  Sections 4.1.2 and 4.4.2 seems like the places to
find them (if they exist).

What rounding mode is used for conversions of real literal constants?
Is the same rounding mode used for all such conversions?

The following four questions are about positive values, but the same
would apply to negative values.

Must all "decimal values" in the range smallest non-zero finite
internal value (which could be a denormal) to largest finite internal
value, e.g. 0.1, be converted?

Must all "decimal values" in the range zero to smallest non-zero
finite internal value, e.g. 1.0e-999999999, be converted?

Must all "decimal values" larger than the largest finite internal
value, e.g. 9.9e+99999999999, be converted if infinity is an internal
value?  What does nearest rounding mean for these cases?

What requirements exist for "decimal values" larger than the largest
finite internal value if infinity is not an internal value?

ANSWER:

There are no requirements on accuracy for conversions of real literal
constants.

The standard does not specify the rounding mode used for conversions
of real literal constants, nor does it require the same rounding mode
to be used for all conversions.

Whether all decimal values in any range can be converted is not
standardized.

There are no requirements for "decimal values" larger than the largest
finite internal value whether infinity is an internal value or not.

QUESTION:

The last sentence of 10.10.2.2 of Fortran 2003 states:
    Except for continuation of delimited character sequences, each
    output record begins with a blank character.

If a namelist output statement causes a user-defined derived-type
output procedure to be called, was it intended to be standard-
conforming for that procedure to create a new record (perhaps by using
the slash edit descriptor) that does not begin with a blank character?

ANSWER:

Yes, this situation was intended to be standard-conforming.  Explicit formatting
in user-defined derived-type output is not required to output a leading blank
in this case.  An edit is provided to correct this oversight.

QUESTION:

In 12.3.2.1.1 of Fortran 2003, at [262:8-9], the following is stated
about the dummy arguments of a function that defines an operation:
    The dummy arguments shall be nonoptional dummy data objects and
    shall be specified with INTENT (IN).

This clearly states that a dummy argument of such a function cannot be
a procedure pointer.  The same is not stated for the dummy arguments
of a subroutine that defines assignment.

Was it intended that procedure pointers should be allowed in defined
assignment, but not in defined operations?

ANSWER:

No.  It was not intended that procedure pointers should be allowed in
either defined assignment or defined operations.  An edit is provided
to correct this oversight.

TITLE: Can child I/O statements be advancing I/O statements?
KEYWORDS: UDDTIO, ADVANCE=
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

[175:30-31] of Fortran 2003 states:
    An advancing input/output statement always positions a record file
    after the last record read or written, unless there is an error
    condition.

Since a child I/O statement does not position a file after the last
Record [194:19][199:8-9], this implies that a child I/O statement cannot 
be an advancing I/O statement.

[189:6-9] of Fortran 2003 states:
    The ADVANCE= specifier determines whether advancing input/output
    occurs for this input/output statement. If YES is specified,
    advancing input/output occurs. If NO is specified, nonadvancing
    input/output occurs (9.2.3.1). If this specifier is omitted from
    an input/output statement that allows the specifier, the default
    value is YES.

This clearly states that any data transfer statement is an advancing
I/O statement if the value 'NO' is not specified for the ADVANCE=
specifier.

These two statements seem to contradict each other. 

QUESTION:

If a child I/O statement does not have an ADVANCE= specifier with the
value 'NO', is it an advancing I/O statement?

DISCUSSION:

The answer to this question affects the value for the IOSTAT variable
for child READ statements in some situations.  For example, in the
following program, the value of "stat1" should be equal to IOSTAT_EOF
if the child READ statement is advancing, but it should be equal to
IOSTAT_EOR if the statement is nonadvancing.

      MODULE m
        TYPE t
          CHARACTER(2) :: x(2)
        CONTAINS
          PROCEDURE :: readT
          GENERIC :: READ(FORMATTED) => readT
        END TYPE
      CONTAINS
        SUBROUTINE readT(dtv, unit, iotype, v_list, iostat, iomsg)
          CLASS(t), INTENT(INOUT) :: dtv
          INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: unit
          CHARACTER(*), INTENT(IN) :: iotype
          INTEGER, INTENT(IN)  :: v_list(:)
          INTEGER, INTENT(OUT) :: iostat
          CHARACTER(*), INTENT(INOUT) :: iomsg
          READ (unit, '(2a2)', IOSTAT=iostat) dtv%x
        END SUBROUTINE
      END MODULE

      PROGRAM p
        USE m
        USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
        TYPE(t) t1
        CHARACTER(3) :: c = '123'
        INTEGER stat1
        READ (c, *, IOSTAT=stat1) t1
        PRINT *, (stat1 == IOSTAT_EOR), (stat1 == IOSTAT_EOF)
      END PROGRAM

No, such a child I/O statement is not advancing.  Edits are provided

TITLE: Default initialization for "automatic" components
KEYWORDS: Parameterized Derived Type, Default Initialization
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

Consider
  TYPE t(len)
    INTEGER,LEN :: len
    CHARACTER(len) :: cvalue = "xyz"
  END TYPE

  SUBROUTINE s(n)
    TYPE(t(n)) x
    ...

  TYPE t2(len2)
    TYPE(t(len2)) :: tvalue = t(10,"fred nurke")
  END TYPE

  SUBROUTINE s2(n)
    TYPE(t(n)) :: y
    ...

The type definition for T appears to conform to the standard; it
allows an "automatic" component to be default initialized.  However,
the declaration of the local variable X in subroutine S will
initialize the component differently depending on the value of N, for
example, giving the CVALUE component the value "", "x", "xy", "xyz",
"xyz " for N being 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively.

Q1. Was it intended that "automatic" components can be
    default-initialized?

If the answer is "Yes", the type definition for T2 also appears to
conform to the standard.  However, the declaration of Y in S2 will not
work if N has any value other than 10 at run time.  This is
surprising;  there appears to be no other situation where the runtime
value of a length type parameter can render a declaration invalid.
Is this situation intentional?

ANSWER:

Q1. No, this was not intended.  An edit is supplied to fix this.

Q2. Not applicable.
