NUMBER: F03/0098
TITLE: Does allocate with source= define subcomponents?
KEYWORDS: allocate, source, define
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress


QUESTION:

Was it intended that an allocate with a source= clause define
subcomponents?

Bullet 11 on 422 says "Successful execution of an allocate STATEMENT
...causes the subcomponent to become undefined."

ANSWER:

An Allocate with a SOURCE= specifier was intended to define
subcomponents.

In fact, none of the lists in clause 16 account for a SOURCE=
specifier.  Edits are supplied to clarify this.

EDITS:

[113:21]  At the end of the last sentence in 6.3.1.1 insert
"unless they are defined by a SOURCE= specifier"

[421:27-28] 16.5.6, list item 19, modify by adding after
       "Allocation of an object", "except by an ALLOCATE statement
       with a SOURCE= specifier".

[421:28+] 16.5.6, insert new list item after (19)
      "(19a) Successful execution of an ALLOCATE statement with a
             SOURCE= specifier causes a subobject of the allocated
             object to become defined if the corresponding subobject
             of the SOURCE= expression is defined."

[422:41]  16.5.6, list item (11) insert "with no SOURCE= specifier" after
"ALLOCATE statement"

[422:43+]  16.5.6, add a new list item after (11),
      "(11a) Successful execution of an ALLOCATE statement with a
             SOURCE= specifier causes a subobject of the allocated
             object to become undefined if the corresponding
             subobject of the SOURCE= expression is undefined."
