From: Steve Lionel
Subject: Emeritus members of PL22.3(J3)
Date: 2022-March-03

INCITS (J3's parent organization) allows former members to be nominated
for "Emeritus" status. The INCITS policies and procedures document states:

	The Emeritus Member title recognizes individuals for their extensive 
	contribution to standards activities and enables INCITS to call on 
	their extensive history and talent for continuity following their 
	retirement from the ICT industry.

	A nomination for appointment as an Emeritus Member shall be made 
	either by resolution of the sponsoring TC, TG or SG; or by the INCITS 
	Secretariat. The recommendation may be proposed once the individual 
	meets the following requirements:

	- must not be a representative of a dues-paying member of the committee;
	- shall have served on an INCITS TC, TG or SG for a minimum of 10 
	  years; and
	- shall have made significant contributions to standards efforts.

	Emeritus Members hold non-voting, non-dues-paying memberships in 
	relation to a specific TC, TG or SG.

Note that ISO does not recognize INCITS Emeritus status.

The following former members of J3 currently have Emeritus status with 
INCITS as of March 3, 2022:

Dick Hendrickson
Richard Maine
Dan Nagle
Van Snyder
