It is often desired to have objects of a derived type for which some
components have the PROTECTED attribute while others do not. This
feature allows the PROTECTED attribute to be specified in the
declaration of a data component in a type definition. Any object of that
type will have components with PROTECTED attribute for components
declared with that attribute, independent of whether the whole object
has the PROTECTED attribute.
