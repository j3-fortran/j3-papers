1. Introduction

Comment MTC10 was

    Add a facility for controlling IEEE underflow

    There should be a standard way of finding out, and setting on
    systems that permit it, the underflow handling mode.  Many machines
    have settable "abrupt underflow" vs. "gradual  underflow" and can
    run noticeably faster in abrupt underflow mode.  We suggest
    adding procedures IEEE_SET_DENORMAL_MODE(HANDLED) and
    IEEE_GET_DENORMAL_MODE(HANDLED) with HANDLED of type default
    logical. The inquiry function IEEE_SUPPORT_DENORMAL_CONTROL() would
    also be appropriate.
    
2. Discussion

Since this actually controls what happens during underflow, calling this the
underflow mode and changing the routines to IEEE_SET_UNDERFLOW_MODE(GRADUAL),
IEEE_GET_UNDERFLOW_MODE(GRADUAL) and IEEE_SUPPORT_UNDERFLOW_CONTROL would
seem to be appropriate.

Since IEEE_SUPPORT_DENORMAL is in IEEE_ARITHMETIC (not IEEE_EXCEPTIONS),
that location would also be appropriate for these routines.

  "14.4A Underflow mode

   Some processors allow control during program execution of whether underflow
   produces a denormalized number in conformance with the IEEE standard
   (gradual underflow) or whether to produce zero instead (abrupt underflow).
   On such processors, floating-point performance is typically better in abrupt
   underflow mode than in gradual underflow mode.

   Control over the underflow mode is exercised by invocation of
   IEEE_SET_UNDERFLOW_MODE.  The function IEEE_GET_UNDERFLOW_MODE can be used
   to inquire which underflow mode is in operation.  The function
   IEEE_SUPPORT_UNDERFLOW_MODE can be used to inquire whether this facility is
   available.  The initial underflow mode is processor dependent.  In a
   procedure other than IEEE_SET_UNDERFLOW_MODE or IEEE_SET_STATUS, the
   processor shall not change the underflow mode on entry, and on return shall
   ensure that the underflow mode is the same as it was on entry.

   The underflow mode only affects floating-point calculations whose type is
   that of an X for which IEEE_SUPPORT_UNDERFLOW_CONTROL returns true."

[359:30] After "mode" insert ", underflow mode".
