Discussion
----------

In his vote (see N1999), Reinhold Bader pointed that MOVE_ALLOC needs to
be modified to take account of the presence of failed images and that
extra arguments should be added to provide warnings of failed images.

When the arguments FROM and TO are coarrays, the subroutine behaves as
a collective, but this is not the case for non-coarray arguments so
the subroutine cannot be changed to be a collective.

Edits to N1996:
---------------

[26:10+] Add new subclause:
7.5.0 MOVE_ALLOC
The description of the intrinsic function MOVE_ALLOC in
ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010 is changed to take account of the possibility
of failed images and to add two optional arguments STAT and
ERRMSG and a modified result if either is present. The following
text replaces paragraphs 4-6 of the description and the paragraph that
was added by Corrigendum 2:
STAT (optional) shall be a scalar of type default integer. It is an
      INTENT(OUT) argument.
ERRMSG (optional) shall be a scalar of type default character. It is an
      INTENT(INOUT) argument.

If the execution is successful
(1) The allocation status of TO becomes unallocated if FROM is
    unallocated on entry to MOVE_ALLOC. Otherwise, TO becomes allocated
    with dynamic type, type parameters, array bounds, array cobounds,
    and value identical to those that FROM had on entry to MOVE_ALLOC.
(2) If TO has the TARGET attribute, any pointer associated with FROM
    on entry to MOVE_ALLOC becomes correspondingly associated with TO.
    If TO does not have the TARGET attribute, the pointer association
    status of any pointer associated with FROM on entry becomes
    undefined.
(3) The allocation status of FROM becomes unallocated.

When a reference to MOVE_ALLOC is executed for which the FROM argument
is a coarray, there is an implicit synchronization of all nonfailed
images of the current team. On each nonfailed image, execution of the
segment (8.5.2) following the CALL statement is delayed until all other
nonfailed images of the current team have executed the same statement
the same number of times.

If the STAT argument is present and execution is successful, the
argument is assigned the value zero.

If the STAT argument is present and an error condition occurs, the
argument is assigned a nonzero value. The value shall be that of the
constant STAT_FAILED_IMAGE in the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV if
the reason is that a failed image has been detected in the current
team; otherwise, the value shall be that of the constant
STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE in the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV if the
reason is that a successful execution would have involved an
interaction with an image that has initiated termination; otherwise,
the value is a processor-dependent positive value that is different
from the value of STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE or STAT_FAILED_IMAGE.

If the ERRMSG argument is present and an error condition occurs, the
processor shall assign an explanatory message to the argument. If no
such condition occurs, the processor shall not change the value of the
argument.

[32:1-] Before the edit for 13.5 add
{In 13.5 Standard generic intrinsic procedures, Table 13.1, edit the
entry for MOVE_ALLOC as follows}
MOVE_ALLOC     (FROM, TO [, STAT, ERRMSG])  PS   Move an allocation.

[32:6+] Before the edit for 13.7.126 add
{In 13.7.118 MOVE_ALLOC, replace the title by}
13.7.118 MOVE_ALLOC (FROM, TO [, STAT, ERRMSG])
---------------------------------------------------------------
{In 13.7.118 MOVE_ALLOC, make the changes given in subclause 7.5.0
of this Technical Specification.}
