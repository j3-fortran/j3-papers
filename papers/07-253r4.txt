Subject: UTI 117, 118 (pp 28-29): Error list redundant

Discussion

The editor suggests in UTI 118 that the list of ways that error
termination can occur be deleted since it duplicates text elsewhere in
the standard. We agree.  It is hard to ensure that the list is
complete and that every item is correct.  If an edit is made
elsewhere, there is a danger of overlooking the corresponding edit in
this list.

Since this paper deletes the text found defective by UTI 117, that UTI
can be deleted.

Edits to 07-007r2:

[28:19] In 2.4.5 Execution sequence, para. 6, append to the first line
"an ALL STOP statement is executed or as specified elsewhere in
\thisstandard."

[28:20-33] In 2.4.5 Execution sequence, replace the remainder of
para. 6 with

"NOTE 2.11a

As well as in the circumstances specified in \thisstandard, error
termination might be initiated by means other than Fortran."
