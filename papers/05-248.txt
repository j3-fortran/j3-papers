Subject: libm math functions
Date:    2005 August 4


At Delft, it was decided to pursue the libm procedures.
This paper attempts to provide edits to do so.
The specifications are in 05-132r2.

There is one straw vote which should be taken before details
may be finalized, viz, how to handle the signgam external
variable used by the libm C binding to return the sign of gamma
when the log of abs( gamma) is computed.  I believe the best
choices are:

1. Have two procedures, say log_gamma_func() and sign_gamma_func(),
   and trusting compilers to recognize when the argument
   doesn't change between references,
-or-
2. Use a subroutine, say log_gamma_func(), which may be elemental
   and allow optional, intent( out) arguments,
-or-
3. Any other ideas,
-or-
4. Undecided.

The design specified by earlier papers used an optional,
intent(out) argument to the log_gamma function, which is not allowed
if log_gamma() is to be a pure function.

As a reminder, the specifications are:

Detailed Specification: Add subsections to Section 13 detailing
                        the Fortran names for these procedures.  (The C names
                        should not be used due to the common usage, in
                        Fortran, of names such as j0 etc.)

                        The functions are (the C names):

                        Bessel functions (j0, j1, jn, y0, y1, yn)
                        Error Functions (erf, erfc)
                        Hypotenuse (hypot)
                        Gamma and log gamma (tgamma, lgamma)

                        The detailed mathematical specification of these
                        procedures is given in the references above.
                        The intention is to allow the vendor to use
                        the procedure supplied by libm, so the exact
                        specification is left to libm, which is most likely
                        what the applications programmer wants.

                        Edits would include adding to the list in 13.5.2:

                        BESSEL_J0
                        BESSEL_J1
                        BESSEL_JN
                        BESSEL_Y0
                        BESSEL_Y1
                        BESSEL_YN
                        COMP_ERROR_FUNC
                        ERROR_FUNC
                        GAMMA_FUNC
                        HYPOT
                        LOG_GAMMA_FUNC

Edits:  (Note that these edits assume branch 2 of the straw vote is taken.)
