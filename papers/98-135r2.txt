    Changes since "r0" are marked with "|" in the left column.
    I did search chapters 1-15 for all occurences of "assumed", and added
    a few edits below.

    Changes since R1:
    Added
         Note: The processor is expected to select a suitable length
         for the elements of the arg_text array, such that all characters
         specified for all command line arguments are present in the
         arg_text array.  Similarly, the processor is expected to select a
         suitable length for command_line, such that the entire
         command line is present.
    and
         The values in argument_length shall not be greater than LEN(arg_text).

    Specification and Syntax:

    The PROGRAM statement may include the following arguments, as shown.
    The type of argument is what determines what is stored into it by the
    processor, not the actual name of the dummy argument.

        PROGRAM jerry (argument_text, argument_length, command_line)

        CHARACTER (LEN=*)                 :: command_line
        CHARACTER (LEN=*), DIMENSION (0:) :: argument_text
        INTEGER, DIMENSION (0:)           :: argument_length

    The dummy arguments above, if specified, will have the following values:
        command_line  -- the text of the command_line, in a processor dependent form
        argument_text -- the "parsed" command line.  Parsing (delimiters etc.)
                             is processor dependent
                         argument_text(0)  is the command name (if available)
                                       which invoked the current program
                         argument_text(1)  is the first argument on the command line
                                 .
                                 .
                                 .
                         argument_text(size(argument_text)-1)  is the last argument
                                                           from the command line
        argument_length -- the effective lengths of the parsed arguments in
                           "argument_text", used to trim insignificant blanks
                           from the end of argument in "argument_text" (only needed
                           if there might be significant trailing blanks, otherwise
                           TRIM seems preferable).

    The "command_line" and "argument_text" arguments shall be of type default
    character and assumed length.

    The "argument_text" and "argument_length" arguments must be assumed shape.

    The "argument_length" argument must be of type default integer.

    An element of "argument_text" and the "command_line" argument will always be
    at least of length 1.

    When argument_text or argument_length is present on the PROGRAM statement,
    the lower bound shall be present in the declaration for that variable, and
    shall be zero.

    A length of zero (and therefore all blanks) for an argument indicates no
    argument was present, the argument was null, or the processor could not obtain
    the argument (in this position).

    argument_length(0) may be zero if the processor does not support the concept of,
    or cannot obtain a command name.

    The argument_text and argument_length arrays will always have at least
    one element (element (0)).

            R11xx   program-arg  is  program-arg-name "

    Add a new section 11.1.1 [195:37+] and renumber the sections 11.1.1 - 11.1.3.
        "11.1.1  Main program arguments
         The PROGRAM statement may include the arguments described in this section.
         These variables, if present, are initialized by the processor as described
         below.  The meaning and interpretation of the terms "command line", "command
         line argument", "delimiter", and "command name" are processor dependent.

         The actual name of each main program argument is not significant.  The
  |      type and rank of each argument shall be one of those described in this
  |      section, and only one variable of each type and rank shall appear in a
         PROGRAM statement.

         Program statement argument types and values:

         CHARACTER (LEN=*)                 :: command_line
             The "command_line" argument contains the processor dependent
         representation of the command line which invoked the program.
  |      The "command_line" argument, if present, shall be declared assumed
         length, and of type default character.  LEN(command_line) will always
         be at least one.

         Note: Various user interfaces, including text and graphical user
             interfaces, may process the command line.
             Note: A program's command line includes information which is
         associated with the program at startup.  This information includes,
         but is not limited to, character strings included with the
         program's startup command.

         CHARACTER (LEN=*), DIMENSION (0:) :: argument_text
             The "argument_text" array argument contains the text of the command
         line.  "argument_text(0)" contains the command name from the command
         line.  "argument_text(i)" contains the i'th argument after the
         command name.  "argument_text(size(argument_text)-1)" contains the
         last argument from the command line.

  |      The "argument_text" argument, if present, shall be declared assumed
         length, assumed shape with an explicit lower bound of zero, and of
         type default character.  LEN(argument_text(0)) will always be at least
         one.  SIZE(argument_text) will be at least one.
             An element of "argument_text" will always be at least of length one.

                                                        J3/98-135r2
                                                                page 3 of 3
         INTEGER, DIMENSION (0:)           :: argument_length
             The "argument_length" array argument contains the length of the
         significant character string in each corresponding element in the
         "argument_text" array.

         Any characters in the n'th element of "argument_text" beyond the
         "argument_length(n)" position shall be blanks.

  |      The values in argument_length shall not be greater than LEN(arg_text).

  |      Note: The processor is expected to select a suitable length
  |      for the elements of the arg_text array, such that all characters
  |      specified for all command line arguments are present in the
  |      arg_text array.  Similarly, the processor is expected to select a
  |      suitable length for command_line, such that the entire
  |      command line is present.

  |      The "argument_length" argument, if present, shall be declared assumed
         shape with an explicit lower bound of zero, and of type default integer.
         SIZE(argument_length) will be equal to SIZE(argument_text).

         Note: A value of zero for an element of argument_length indicates the
  |      argument was not present, was zero length, or could not be obtained by
         the processor.

         Note: A value of zero for argument_length(0) indicates the processor
         did not provide a command name.


  |      A program-arg variable declaration may include the TARGET attribute.
  |      No other attributes may be specified for a program-arg variable.
