Discussion

There are numerous defects in C12.2 Example of Fortran calling C
(15.3). In addition to the problems pointed out in UTI 124, the
Fortran example code includes the declaration of an array with both
the allocatable attribute and an explicit shape, and the reference to
a function using a CALL statement. The unnatural declaration for the
dummy argument RECVCOUNTS seems more confusing than informative, and
missed the opportunity to illustrate that an allocatable actual
argument can correspond to an assumed-size dummy argument, and that
the interface is where the interoperability is specified. Finally, the
final sentence of para 6 seems to suggest that Note 12.46 is somehow
related to this example.  In fact, it is just another example. This
seems more distracting than helpful.


Edits to repair the example are provided below.

Edits to 07-007r2:

All edits are to subclause C12.2 Example of Fortran calling C (15.3).

[587:1-3] Delete module FNT_C_1

[587:10] Replace "USE FTN_C_1" with 
                 "USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_C_BINDING"

[587:14] Replace "TYPE(C_PTR) , VALUE :: RECVCOUNTS" with
                 "INTEGER(C_INT) :: RECVCOUNTS(*)"

[587:19] Delete the sentence "The intrinsic...in the module FTN_C_1."

[587:21] Delete the final sentence of para 6: "See also Note 12.46."

[587:26-27] Replace para 9 with:

 "The third C formal parameter is the int pointer recvcounts, which
 corresponds to the Fortran dummy argument RECVCOUNTS, which is an
 assumed-size array of type INTEGER(C_INT)."

[587:33] Append ", RET"

[587:34] Replace ", TARGET :: RECVCOUNTS(100)" with " :: RECVCOUNTS(:)"

[587:38-39] Replace the CALL statement with

 "RET = C_LIBRARY_FUNCTION (C_LOC(SEED), SENDCOUNT, RECVCOUNTS)"

[587:41 - 588:1] Replace para 12 with

 "The preceding code shows an example of how C_Library_Function might
 be referenced in a Fortran program unit."

[588:2-5] Replace para 13 with

 "The first Fortran actual argument is a reference to the function
 C_LOC which returns the value of the C address of its argument, SEND.
 This value becomes the value of the first formal parameter, the
 pointer sendbuf, in C_Library_Function."

[588:6-8] Replace para 14 with

 "The second Fortran actual argument is SENDCOUNT of type
 INTEGER(C_INT). Its value becomes the initial value of the second
 formal parameter, the int sendcount, in C_Library_Function."

[588:9-13] Replace para 15 with

 "The third Fortran actual argument is the allocatable array
 RECVCOUNTS of type INTEGER(C_INT). The base C address of this array
 becomes the value of the third formal parameter, the pointer
 recvcounts, in C_Library_Function.  Note that interoperability is
 based on the characteristics of the dummy arguments in the specified
 interface and not on those of the actual arguments. Thus, the fact
 that the actual argument is allocatable is not relevant here."
