1 Introduction

Addition of the circular trigonometric functions was given specifications
in m218, during which 19-157r1 was passed.  This paper makes minor
corrections and proposes edits.

2 Specifications

These elemental intrinsics are generic and not specific.
All would be similar to their radian counterparts except that the
argument(s) or return values would be half-revolutions.

3 Syntax

    ACOSPI (X)
    Description: Inverse circular cosine function.
    Class: Elemental function.
    Argument: X shall be of type real with a value that satisfies the
              inequality |X| <= 1.
    Result Characteristics: Same as X.
    Result Value: The result has a value equal to a processor-dependent
    approximation to arccos(X)/pi. It is expressed in
    half-revolutions and lies in the range of 0 to 1 (inclusive).

    ASINPI (X)
    Description: Inverse circular sine function.
    Class: Elemental function.
    Argument: X shall be of type real with a value that satisfies the
              inequality |X| <= 1.
    Result Characteristics: Same as X.
    Result Value: The result has a value equal to a processor-dependent
    approximation to arcsin(X)/pi. It is expressed in half-revolutions
    and lies in the range of -1/2 to 1/2 (inclusive).

    ATANPI (X) or ATANPI (Y, X)
    Description: Inverse circular tangent function.
    Class: Elemental function.
    Arguments:
     Y     shall be of type real.
     X     If Y appears, X shall be of type real with the same kind type
           parameter as Y. If Y has the value zero, X shall not have the
           value zero. If Y does not appear, X shall be of type real.
    Result Characteristics: Same as X.
    Result Value: If Y appears, the result is the same as the result of
    ATAN2PI (Y, X). If Y does not appear, the result is expressed in
    half-revolutions, with a value equal to a processor-dependent
    approximation to arctan(X)/pi, and lies in the range
    -1/2 to 1/2 (inclusive).

    ATAN2PI (Y, X)
    Description: Inverse circular tangent function.
    Class: Elemental function.
    Arguments:
     Y     shall be of type real.
     X     X shall be of the same type and kind type
           parameter as Y. If Y has the value zero, X shall not have the
           value zero.
    Result Characteristics: Same as X
    Result Value: The result is expressed in half-revolutions and has a
    value equal to a processor-dependent approximation to arctan(Y/X)/pi
    if X /= 0; it lies in the range -1 to 1 (inclusive). If Y > zero,
    the result is positive. If Y < zero, the result is negative. If
    Y = zero, the result is Y (if X > zero), approximately 1 (if X < zero
    and Y is positive real zero or the processor does not distinguish
    between positive and negative real zero) or approximately -1 (if
    Y is negative real zero). If X = zero, the absolute value of the
    result is approximately 1/2.

    COSPI (X)
    Description: Circular cosine function.
    Class: Elemental function.
    Argument: X shall be of type real, regarded as a value in
    half-revolutions.
    Result Characteristics: Same as X.
    Result Value: The result has a value equal to a processor-dependent
    approximation to cos(X * pi).

    SINPI (X)
    Description: Circular sine function.
    Class: Elemental function.
    Argument: X shall be of type real, regarded as a value in
    half-revolutions.
    Result Characteristics: Same as X.
    Result Value: The result has a value equal to a processor-dependent
    approximation to sin(X * pi).

    TANPI (X)
    Description: Circular tangent function.
    Class: Elemental function.
    Argument: X shall be of type real, regarded as a value in
    half-revolutions.
    Result Characteristics: Same as X.
    Result Value: The result has a value equal to a processor-dependent
    approximation to tan(X * pi).
