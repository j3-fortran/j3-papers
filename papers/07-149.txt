Discussion of UTI 99 (page 2)

Some properties of images are not specified by the standard.  These
are mentioned in Notes in the standard, but should also be included in
the list of Exclusions, subclause 1.4, starting at [1:25].

Some of the current exclusions already cover important aspects of
parallel execution. In particular, the runtime support needed to set
up and coordinate execution in parallel is covered by exclusion
(2). The mechanisms needed for remote references and defintions are
already covered by exclusion (10).

The wording of the current exclusion (6), "the mechanism for
determining the number of images of a program" needs to be repaired.
The number of images can be easily determined by a reference to
NUM_IMAGES. The mechanism for specifying the number if images is what
is excluded.


Edits to J3/07-007

All in subclause 1.4 Exclusions:

[2:1] In item (5) replace "the size or complexity of a program" with
"the size, maximum number of images, or complexity of a program".

[2:3] In item (6) replace "determining" with "specifying".
