  change
    "Both the starting point and the ending point shall be within the range
     1, 2, ..., n [where n is the length of the string] unless the   
     starting point exceeds the ending point, in which case the substring
     has length zero."
  to
    "If the starting point is greater than the ending point, the substring
     has length zero; otherwise, both the starting point and the ending
     point shall be within the range 1, 2, ..., n."
{Improve clarity of exposition.}

[130:27] 6.7.3.2p3, "an unsaved" -> "any unsaved allocated".
