Discussion

1. We agree that there needs to be a reference to 2.3.6 in CLOSE.

2. We have rechecked all the places in the standard that refer to
termination and found one place where an edit is desirable.

3. We do not see what change to CLOSE is being suggested.

4. The normative text simply says that the files are closed, rather
than that a CLOSE statement is executed.  Synchronization is not
necessary since all the images have reached the completion step. If
synchronization does occur it is up to the processor to coordinate the
ordering and ensure prompt termination.  Note 9.24 is misleading for
files opened on more than one image and needs to be repaired.

Edits to J3/07-007r1

[208:14] In 9.1.3 ENDFILE record, bullet 2, change "program termination"
to "termination of image execution".

[222:13] In 9.4.6 CLOSE statement, para. 6, line 1, after "completion
step" add "(2.3.6)".

[222:16+1] At the end of the sentence in Note 9.24, replace "connected
unit." by "connected unit, but without team synchronization for units
with a connect team of more than one image."
