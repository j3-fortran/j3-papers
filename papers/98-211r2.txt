Subject:     Edits for M.25, stream I/O

Specs and syntax for M.25, stream I/O were approved in paper
98-209r2.  The following are edits to implement those specs
and syntax.  A previous draft of the edits was separated into
two papers, 98-210r0 and 98-211.  The current draft subsumes
both of those previously separate papers, plus revisions
to accomodate the approved specs and syntax.

These edits are all relative to J3/98-007R3.

In 9.0

  [155:1+] Add J3 note (not really related to stream I/O).
  [BEGIN J3 NOTE]
  It has been suggested that we check for consistency about the
  spelling of input/output vs I/O vs IO.
  [END J3 NOTE]

  [155:11] add ", WAIT" after "REWIND".
     This edit not really related to stream I/O.

  It was already a bit anomalous to start talking about records before
  we mentioned that files have (or now may have) records.  This anomaly
  gets worse when files might not have records.  So we will do a minor
  reorganization.  The (very little) material in 9.2.0 can be readily
  moved up into 9.0 and expended to cover the new concepts.  And we then
  promote all the 9.2 subsections up one level (they went a little
  deep anyway).  Thus:

  [155:15+] Add as new paragraphs
   "A file is composed of either a sequence of file storage units or a
    sequence of records, which provide an extra level of organization
    to the file.  A file composed of records is called a <<record
    file>>.  A file composed of a sequence of file storage units
    without a record structure is called a <<stream file>>.  A
    processor may allow a file to be viewed both as a record file and
    as a stream file; in this case the relationship between the file
    storage units when viewed as a stream file and the records when
    viewed as a record file is processor dependent.

    A file is either an external file or an internal file."

  [155:38] "processor-dependent" -> "file storage (9.2.1.4)"

In 9.2, Files

  [156:19-23]  Delete all of 9.2 (including the heading), except
  for the note 9.3.  Then promote all former subsections of 9.2
  up one level.

  [156:24-25] Add "external" before "files" in note 9.3
  and then move the note to [156:36+]

In C.6.1

  [387:32] "Files" -> "External files" and change the xref to
  be to the external files section in 9.

In 9.2.1.2.*, File access

  [157:8] Replace the first sentence by
    "There are three methods of accessing the data of an external file:
     sequential, direct, and stream."

  [157:16+]  Add para
     "<<Sequential access>> is a method of accessing the records of
      an external record file in the order of their record numbers."

  [157:17] Unbolden "sequential access"

  [157:30-31]  replace these lines by
     "(3) The records of the file shall be read or written only by
          sequential access input/output statements."

  [157:32+]  Add para
     "<<Direct access>> is a method of accessing the records of an
      external record file in arbitrary order."

  [157:17] Unbolden "direct access"

  [157:45-46] replace these lines by
     "(3) The records of the file shall be read or written only by
          direct access input/output statements."

  [158:8+]  Add new section
    "9.2.2.3 Stream access

      <<Stream access>> is a method of accessing the file storage
      units of an external stream file.

      When connected for stream access, an external file has the
      following properties:

      (1) The file storage units of the file shall be read or written
          only by stream access input/output statements.

      (2) Each file storage unit in the file is uniquely identified
          by a positive integer called the position.  The order of the
          file storage units in the file is the order of their positions.

      (3) File storage units need not be read or written in order of their
          position.  For example, it is permissible to write the file
          storage unit at position 3, even though the file storage units
          at positions 1 and 2 have not been written.  Any file storage
          unit may be read from the file while it is connected to a unit,
          provided that the file storage unit has been written since the
          file was created."

In 9.2.1.3.*, File position

  [158:12-14]  Replace "record(s)" by
    "record(s) or file storage unit(s)" 3 times.

  [158:15] "file" -> "record file"

  [158:25+] Add a para
    "For a file connected for stream access, the file position is either
     between two file storage units, at the initial point of the file,
     at the terminal point of the file, or undefined."

  [158:27,29] "the file" -> "a record file" twice.

  [158:35-36] "sequential or direct" -> "sequential, direct, or stream"

  [159:4+]  Add para
    "For stream access, the file is positioned immediately before the
     file storage unit specified by the POS= specifier; if there is no
     POS= specifier, the file position is not changed."

  [159:8+] Add para
     "For stream access, if no error condition occurred, the file
      position is not changed."

  [159:14+] Add new section
     "9.2.1.4 File storage units

      [Add file storage unit to the index pointing here]

      A <<file storage unit>> is the basic unit of storage in a stream
      file or an unformatted record file.  It is the unit of file
      position in stream access, the unit of record length in
      unformatted direct access, and the unit of file size for all
      external files.

      Every value in a stream file or an unformatted record file shall
      occupy an integer number of file storage units, which shall be
      the same for all scalar values of the same type and type
      parameters.  The number of file storage units required for an
      item of a given type and type parameters may be determined using
      the IOLENGTH= specifier of the INQUIRE statement (9.7.3).

      In a file connected for stream access, the processor shall not
      have alignment restrictions that prevent a value of any type
      and type parameters from being stored at any positive integer
      file position.

      It is recommended that the file storage unit be an 8-bit octet
      where this choice is practical.

      [BEGIN NOTE]
        The requirement that every data value occupy an integer number
        of file storage units implies that data items inherently smaller
        than a file storage unit will require padding.  This suggests
        that the file storage unit be small to avoid wasted space.
        Ideally, the file storage unit would be choosen such that
        padding is never required.  A file storage unit of one bit would
        always meet this goal, but would likely be impractical because
        of the alignment requirements.

        The prohibition on alignment restrictions prohibits the
        processor from requiring file data alignments larger than the
        file storage unit.

        The 8-bit octet is recommended as a good compromise that is small
        enough to accomodate the requirements of many applications, yet
        not so small that the data alignment requirements are likely to
        cause significant performance problems.
      [END NOTE]"

In 9.2.2, Internal files

  [159:19] "has" -> "is a record file with"

  The two subsections of this section aren't clearly distinguishable.
  Although the first is labelled as "properties" and the second as
  "restrictions", there are things in the first list that are clearly
  restrictions, and there are things in the second list that directly
  correspond to "properties" listed for external files.  Thus:

  [159:18]  Delete the section heading

  [160:1-2] Delete the section heading and the lead-in to the list

  [160:3-6] Renumber these as items 10 and 11.

  [160:4] Delete "that do not specify namelist formatting"

In 9.3.4, OPEN statement

  [163:26] "or DIRECT" -> ", DIRECT, or STREAM"

  [163:27] "or direct" -> ", direct, or stream"

  [163:38+] Add a para
    "If the file is being connected for stream access, then it is
     connected for both formatted and unformatted input/output;
     in this case the OPEN statement shall not have a FORM=
     specifier."

     [BEGIN J3 NOTE]
     We might want to define a form="formatted" for stream.
     It would process record marks, but allow unlimitted
     record lengths.  Or alternatively, might it do to fix up
     sequential formatted to handle unlimitted length records,
     possibly by saying that back tabs cou;d be disallowed on
     some files?
     [END J3 NOTE]

  [163:42] After "." insert "This specifier shall not be present
     when a file is being connected for stream access."

  [164:5] "processor-dependent" -> "file storage"

  [164:22] "sequential" -> "sequential or stream"

  [164:47] "input of a formatted record" -> "formatted input"

  [165:7-8] "output of a formatted record" -> "formatted output"

In 9.4.1 Control information list

  [167:29+] Add new line
     "<<or>> POS = <scalar-int-expr>"

  [168:11] Change "or a <namelist-group-name>" to "or a POS= specifier".

  [168:15] After "sequential" insert "or stream"

  [168:25+] Add new constraint
    "Constraint: If a POS= specifier is present, the
     <io-control-spec-list> shall not contain a REC= specifier."

  [169:24] before the "." insert "or a <<stream access input/output
    statement>>, depending on whether the file connection is for
    sequential access or stream access."

  [169:24+] Add new section
    "9.4.1.4 File position

        The POS= specifier specifies a file position in file
        storage units.  This specifier may be present only in an
        input/output statement that specifies a unit connected
        for stream access.

        A processor may prohibit the use of POS= with particular files
        that do not have the properties necessary to support random
        positioning.  A processor may also prohibit positioning a
        particular file to any position prior to its current file position
        if the file does not have the properties necessary to
        support such positioning.

        [BEGIN NOTE]
          A file that represents connection to a device or data
          stream might not be positionable.
        [END NOTE]"

  [169:37] after "sequential" insert "or stream"

  [170:25] after "external" insert "record"

  [171:1] delete "formatted sequential".

  [171:2] after "omitted" insert "from a formatted sequential
  input/output statement".  (Otherwise we manage to imply that,
  for example, unformatted direct access input/output statements
  all perform advancing formatted sequential input/output, which
  would seem a bit bizzare).

  [171:28]  After "Records" insert "and file storage units"

In 9.4.2, Data transfer I/O list

  This isn't directly related to stream I/O, but its something I
  got reminded of while doing the stream I/O stuff.  It does cause
  some confusion in stream I/O, but only because it causes exactly
  the same confusion elsewhere.  I commented about this once sometime
  before, but my comment apparently got lost.  I don't really feel
  like diverting my stream I/O work to deal with this, so I'll just
  add it as an unresolved issue.

  [173:43+]  Add J3 note after Note 5.29

    "[begin J3 note]
     Unresolved issue xx.

     The definition of the term "effective item" as used in I/O lists
     is dispersed and confused.  Note 9.29 says that the rules in 9.4.2
     determine the list off effective items.  This is true, except that
     the term "effective item is never once mentioned there outside of
     note 9.29 itself.  The rules are there, but not the term.

     The first para of 9.4.4.4, data transfer, appears to define the
     term "next effective item" and even puts in in bold face as
     befits the defining occurance.  It would seem more sensible to
     define the term "effective item".  I think we can rely on the
     English definition of "next".  In addition to that, if this is
     supposed to be the definition, it is wrong, because it does
     NOT mention the rules of 9.4.2.  For example, it does not
     say anything about the treatment of derived types and distinguish
     the cases where a scalar of derived type is treated as a single
     effective item from the cases where it is decomposed into its
     components.

     Speaking of which, note 9.29 is wrong because its statement that
     effective items in formatted i/o are ALWAYS of intrinsic type
     is now incorrect with derived type I/O.

     I suggest that section 9.4.2 say somewhere that it is defining the
     term "effective item".  Then the words about this in 9.4.4 can
     be removed and replaced by a reference to 9.4.2.

     Section 10 uses the term extensively, but should not need modifying,
     except possibly to refer to wherever the term is defined.
     [end J3 note]"

In 9.4.3, Error, etc.

  [174:25] delete "either of"

  [174:28+]  Add list item
     "(3) When an attempt is made to read beyond the end of
          a stream file."

  [174:31]  After the "." add "An end-of-file condition also may
     occur during execution of a stream input statement."

  [176:14] "gg" -> "g"  (typo)

In 9.4.4, Execution of data transfer...

  [177:2] "records" -> "the file"

  [177:36] "current record" -> "file"

  [177:37] "Exactly" -> "If the file is connected for sequential
    or direct access, exactly"

  The following 2 edits doen't really have anything to do with stream
  i/o.  The sentences appear to be no-ops that are more confusing than
  helpful in that they implies that there are other possibilities.
  The only other possibility is that it might be a formatted record
  when we expect an unformatted one or vice versa (as we've defined
  record files to consist of those 3 kinds of records).  We have also
  already said that all of the records of a file are either all
  formatted or all unformatted, except for the endfile record.  And
  we've said that formatted records can only be read/written by
  formatted i/o statements, and simillarly for unformatted.  So there
  is nothing left for these sentences to actually mean.  They confusingly
  implies that a file might have a mixture of formatted and unformatted
  records - perhaps they are holdovers from some draft where that was
  allowed.

  [177:40-41] Delete the sentence "On input, the file shall be positioned
    so that the record read is an unformatted record or an endfile record."
    and change the following "The" to "For sequential or direct access
    input, the".

  [178:27-28] Delete the para.

  [177:41-42] "values" -> "file storage units" (twice)

  [177:42-178:7] Replace "Each value...[end note]" by
     "A value in the file is stored in a contiguous sequence of
      file storage units, begining with the file storage unit
      immediately following the current file position.

      After each value is transfered, the current file position is
      moved to the point immediately after the last file storage
      unit of the value.

      On input, if the file storage units transfered do not
      contain a value with the same type and type parameters as
      the input list entity, then the resulting value of the
      entity is processor-dependent except in the following
      cases:
         (1) A complex list entity may correspond to two
             real values of the same kind stored in the file,
             or visa versa.
         (2) A default character list entity of length n may
             correspond to n default characters stored in the
             file, regardless of the length parameters of the
             entities that were written to these storage units
             of the file.  If the file is connected for stream
             input, the characters may have been written by
             formatted stream output."

  [178:15] "connected for formatted" -> "not connected for unformatted"

  [178:19] delete ", if any".  (It doesn't add anything)

  [178:20-21] Delete "The current..written." and add new para
    "If the file is connected for sequential or direct access, the
     current record and possibly additional records are read or
     written.  If the file is connected for stream access, there
     is no record structure; anything that would otherwise have
     the effect of terminating a record does not have that effect.

     of character data."

  [178:29] "connected for unformatted" -> "not connected for formatted"

  [178:30, 32, 35, 38] "a file" -> "a record file" (4 times).

  [179:25] Before the "."  insert "or at the current file position"

  [180:6,34] Align the ampersands.  (Not related to stream I/O)

  [182:38+]  Add new J3 note

     "Unresolved issue xx

      The derived type I/O section has some wording in the above
      2 paras about "where the last edit descriptor finished".  This
      only makes sense for formatted I/O (and not all cases of that).
      This wording either needs to be generalized, or we need to say
      that it is for formatted I/O, and then add comparable statements
      about unformatted."

In 9.6, File positioning statements

  [185:22-23]  replace the sentence spanning these line with
     "A file that is connected for direct access shall not be referred to
      by a BACKSPACE, ENDFILE, or REWIND statement.  A file that is
      connected for stream access shall not be referred to by a

  [186:9,14] (twice) after "ENDFILE statement" insert
     "for a file connected for sequential access"

     "9.7.1.15 POS= specifier in the INQUIRE statement

      The <scalar-default-int-variable> in the POS= specifier is

      following the current position of a file connected for stream
      access.  If the file is positioned at its terminal position the
      variable is assigned a value one greater than the number of the

     The above statement didn't make sense before anyway.  It was an
     awkward attempt to work around the lack of a term for "file
     storage unit".  The only sensible interpretation I could make
     of "value that would result..." was the value of the actual
     data; I certainly didn't see anything about length or size in
     the old definition.  Luckily the specifier name gives a hint,
     and the requirement that it be useable as a RECL is pretty explicit.
     But these didn't adequately make up for a nonsensical definition.
