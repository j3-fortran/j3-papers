TITLE: Is defined assignment to a vector subscripted array allowed?
KEYWORDS: defined assignment, vector-valued subscripts, elemental
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress


QUESTION:  Is the assignment statement in subroutine cg1018 standard
conforming?

I does an elemental defined assignment to an array with a vector
valued subscript.  Several compilers reject this assignment,
claiming that an INTENT(OUT) argument can't be associated with
a vector-valued actual argument.

According to 142:6-7, this is a defined elemental assignment.

Lines 26 to 30 of 142 are
"The interpretation of a defined assignment is provided by the
subroutine that defines it.

If the defined assignment is an elemental assignment and the variable
in the assignment is an array, the defined assignment is performed
element-by-element, in any order, on corresponding elements of variable
and expr."

The first line looks like a general definition of defined assignment
and the second line looks like a qualification for the specific case of
elemental assignment.  The qualification has to mean that the assignments
are performed on an element-by-element basis and this surely must mean
that the statement is processed as if it were expanded into something
like

      TLA1L(7) = UDA1R(7)
      TLA1L(1) = UDA1R(1)
      TLA1L(3) = UDA1R(3)
      ...
and then the assignment subroutine is invoked on an element-by-element
basis following the rules in chapter 12.

Page 140, lines 4-5 have essentially identical words for intrinsic
assignment and intrinsic assignment to a vector valued array, including
derived type arrays, is allowed (if not many-to-one).

The processors that reject the test program apparently interpret the
assignment as
       Call U_TO_T( TLA1L(NFV1), (UDA1R))
without doing the assignment on an element-by-element basis.

If that interpretation is correct, then we have the unusual situation
where
      TLA1L(NFV1) = TLA1L
is standard conforming if the assignment is intrinsic and non-standard
if the assignment is defined.
