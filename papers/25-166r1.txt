Subject: US04: Syntax for Asynchronous Collective Subroutines

1. Background
-------------
The current Fortran 202Y work list WG5/N2249 includes asynchronous
collective subroutines as accepted work item US04.

Paper J3/25-162r2 "US04: Requirements for Asynchronous Collective
Subroutines" presents an illustrative use case and a list of requirements.

Paper J3/25-165r1 "US04: Specifications for Asynchronous Collective
Subroutines" presents the proposed specifications and semantics for the new
asynchronous collective subroutines feature. Please consult that paper for
all semantic details, which will not be replicated here.

The current paper focuses exclusively on the proposed syntactic elements
for the asynchronous collective subroutines feature.

2. Completion Type Syntax
-------------------------

T1. New type COMPLETION_TYPE is added to the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic
    module.

See J3/25-165r1 for detailed specifications and semantics.

3. Asynchronous Collective Initiation Syntax
--------------------------------------------

An optional COMPLETION argument of type COMPLETION_TYPE is added as the
final argument to each of the five collective subroutines, yielding the
following:

C1. CO_BROADCAST (A, SOURCE_IMAGE [, STAT, ERRMSG, COMPLETION])

C2. CO_MAX (A [, RESULT_IMAGE, STAT, ERRMSG, COMPLETION])

C3. CO_MIN (A [, RESULT_IMAGE, STAT, ERRMSG, COMPLETION])

C4. CO_REDUCE (A, OPERATION [, RESULT_IMAGE, STAT, ERRMSG, COMPLETION])

C5. CO_SUM (A [, RESULT_IMAGE, STAT, ERRMSG, COMPLETION])

See J3/25-165r1 for detailed specifications and semantics.

Note that J3/25-127r1 "DIN1: Collectives over a specified team,
req/spec/syntax/edits" also adds a different trailing optional argument
(TEAM) to each of the collective subroutines above, for work item DIN1.
These two features (US04 and DIN1) are entirely orthogonal, and their
corresponding new arguments could be specified in either order.

C6. Assuming that edits for both work items DIN1 and US04 are applied for
    Fortran 202Y, we propose that the new optional TEAM argument
    immediately precede the new optional COMPLETION argument in the syntax
    of each collective subroutine listed above.

4. Completion Subroutine Syntax
-------------------------------

A new standard intrinsic subroutine called COMPLETE is introduced, with the
following syntax:

W1. COMPLETE( COMPLETION_VAR [, QUERY ])

W2. COMPLETION_VAR   shall be a variable of type COMPLETION_TYPE from the
                     intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV. It shall not be
                     coindexed. It is an INTENT(INOUT) argument.

W3. QUERY (optional) when present, shall be a variable of logical type with
                     the same shape as COMPLETION_VAR. It is an INTENT(OUT)
                     argument.

See J3/25-165r1 for detailed specifications and semantics.
