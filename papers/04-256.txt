Title:                Period as Derived Type Delimiter

Submitted By:    Craig Dedo

Status:            For Consideration

Basic Functionality:
    Fortran should recognize the use of the period (.) as a delimiter in 
derived types in addition to the percent sign (%). 

Rationale:
    The main reason is aesthetic.  The period in this context is easier 
to read.  This is shown by the choice of the period as the derived type 
delimiter in most other languages that support derived types, including 
C, C++, and Java.

Estimated Impact:
    There would be no effect on existing codes.

    This feature may cause a conflict with operators and pre-defined 
constants in fixed source form.  This conflict could be resolved by 
defining the derived type delimiter to have a higher precedence than 
operators and pre-defined constants.  Processors that already implement 
this feature as an extension always use this precedence rule.

    Implementation costs should be minimal.  There may need to be some 
extra syntax checking.

Detailed Specification:
    Change the rule to allow either a period or percent sign as the 
delimiter.
