---------------------

The current words in 06-245 do not specify how soon other images terminate
after one image terminates. This seems to allow an implementation in which
one image terminates and others keep executing indefinitely, which does
not seem to be the intention.

We should add a prohibition that if an image terminates execution
no other image shall reference or define a variable on that image in a
segment not proceeding the segment in which execution terminated.

B subgroup proposes the following straw votes concerning STOP when
NUM_IMAGES()>1:

1. Should a STOP statement executed on one image:
-terminate only the image in question
-terminate all images
-undecided

2. Should abnormal termination of execution of an image:
-terminate only the image in question
-terminate all images
-undecided

3. Should STOP all after SYNC_ALL have a different meaning? If yes, what
does immediately after mean? Can it follow an "END IF" or "CONTINUE"?
