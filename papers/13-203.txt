Subject:   J3 Fortran interp letter ballot #27 - due 11-Jan-2013
Date: 24-Nov-2012


Enclosed in the next letter ballot on Fortran interpretations.

The rules by which we operate say:

    o   J3 votes on the answer at a J3 meeting; a simple majority
        vote marks the answer as "passed by J3 meeting".

    o   Between J3 meetings the chair of /interp sends a J3 letter
        ballot to J3 to approve interp answers that have been "passed
        by J3 meeting".  The letter ballot runs for 30 days.  Not
        voting on three of four consecutive J3 letter ballots is
        grounds to terminate J3 membership.  An interp answer passes
        by a 2/3rds vote;  a no vote must be accompanied by an
        explanation of the changes necessary to change the member's
        vote to yes.

        J3/interp reserves the right to recall an interp answer for
        more study even if the answer passes.

6 Fortran interpretations are currently "Passed by J3 meeting" after
J3 meeting #199.  This is the letter ballot phase to go from "Passed
by J3 meeting" to "Passed by J3 letter ballot".

The following Fortran interpretations are being balloted:

Yes  No   Number     Title

---  ---  F03/0053   The BIND attribute for C_PTR and C_FUNPTR
---  ---  F08/0075   Pointer function reference as variable in assignment
---  ---  F08/0083   Type parameter default expressions allow circular
                      dependence
---  ---  F08/0084   Pointer arguments to PURE functions
---  ---  F08/0085   Problems with PARAMETERs
---  ---  F08/0086   Implied-shape and separate PARAMETER statement

The text of these interpretations is attached.  Each interpretation
starts with a row of "-"s.

Please mark the above -Y- in the Yes column for "yes", -C- in the Yes
column for "yes with comment", or -N- in the No column for a "no"
answer {be sure to include your reasons with "no"} and send only the
above text {not this entire mail message} with any comments to

        j3@j3-fortran.org

by 11:59:59PM, PDT, Friday, 11-Jan-2013, in order to be counted.

NUMBER: F03/0053
TITLE: The BIND attribute for C_PTR and C_FUNPTR
KEYWORDS: BIND attribute, C_PTR, C_FUNPTR, private components
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

1. Do the derived types C_PTR and C_FUNPTR have the BIND attribute?

This affects whether an object of one of these types is permitted
directly in COMMON.  C5101 in the Fortran 2008 standard states "If a
common-block-object is of a derived type, it shall be a sequence type
or a type with the BIND attribute and it shall have no default
initialization."

2. Whether the derived types C_PTR and C_FUNPTR have the BIND
attribute affects whether they are extensible.  Subclause 4.5.7.1 of
the Fortran 2008 standard states "A nonsequence derived type that does
not have the BIND attribute is an extensible type."  Are these types
extensible?

3. Subclause 15.3.3 of the Fortran 2008 standard states that C_PTR and
C_FUNPTR are derived types with private components. Are user-defined
derived types with the BIND attribute permitted to have private
components?

ANSWER:

1. No, these types do not have the BIND attribute.  15.3.3 does not
specify that they have the BIND attribute.  15.3.4 does not require
them to have the BIND attribute in order to make them interoperable.
15.3.5 would require them to interoperate with a C struct if they had
the BIND attribute; this is absurd, since C object pointers and C
function pointers are clearly not structs.

Note that whether these types have default initialization is not
specified by the standard, so possession of BIND would not necessarily
have allowed them in COMMON anyway.

Edits are provided to correct incomplete, and thus misleading,
statements about derived types and the BIND attribute.

2. No, these types were not intended to be extensible.  It was an
oversight that these types were not explicitly excluded from being
extensible by subclause 4.5.7.1 paragraph 1 of the Fortran 2008
standard.  An edit is provided to correct this.

3. Yes, a user-defined derived type with the BIND attribute is
permitted to have private components.  This situation is the same
as for SEQUENCE types, which are similar (but not interoperable).
As with SEQUENCE types, making a component PRIVATE does prevent
access, in a conforming program, to the component by a programmer who
is sufficiently determined; however, it continues to fulfill the
software engineering role for which it was intended.  Note further
that there are many other situations where two different Fortran
derived types will interoperate with the same C derived type; this is
not a defect in either standard, but simply a consequence of the two
languages having different approaches to type compatibility.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[19:15-16] In 1.3.147.6,
  replace the definition of "extensible type"
  with "type that may be extended using the EXTENDS clause (4.5.7.1)".
{Repair definition of extensible type.}

[77:3] In 4.5.7.1p1,
  After "A derived type" insert
    ", other than the type C_PTR or C_FUNPTR from the intrinsic module
     ISO_C_BINDING,"
{Prohibit these types from subsequent extension.}

[431:6] In 15.3.4p1, replace entire paragraph with
  "Interoperability between derived types in Fortran and struct types
   in C is provided by the BIND attribute on the Fortran type."
{Reduce misleading opening blather - this is just here so we didn't
 start the subclause with a bunch of constraints.  Alternatively we
 could move paragraph 2 (and note 15.12) to replacce paragraph 1.}

[431:12+2] In 15.3.4, Note 15.11,
  After "is interoperable" insert "with a C struct type".
{Correct another misleading sentence.}

[431:13-18] In 15.3.4p2,
  Change all four occurrences of "Fortran derived type"
  to "derived type";
  change the single occurrence of "Fortran type" to "derived type".
{Remove unnecessary and confusing qualification of "derived type" with
 "Fortran".}

NUMBER: F08/0075
TITLE: Pointer function reference as variable in assignment
KEYWORDS: Pointer function, assignment, defined operator
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTION:

(1) Consider the following

  module Funcs

    interface operator ( .op. )
      module procedure Unary, Binary
    end interface

  contains

    function Unary ( Arg )
      integer, intent(in) :: Arg
      integer, pointer :: Unary
    ...
    end function Unary

    function Binary ( Arg1, Arg2 )
      integer, intent(in) :: Arg1, Arg2
      integer, pointer :: Binary
    ...
    end function Binary

  end module Funcs

  program What

    use Funcs
    integer :: X, Y = 42

    10 .op. x = y

  end program What

Is the "10" in "10 .op. x = y" an operand, and therefore an argument of
a reference to Binary, or is .op. a reference to Unary and "10" a
statement label?

(2) Consider the following

  module Funcs

    interface operator ( .op. )
      module procedure Unary, Binary
    end interface

  contains

    function Unary ( Arg )
      integer, intent(in) :: Arg
      character(len=...), pointer :: Unary
    ...
    end function Unary

    function Binary ( Arg1, Arg2 )
      integer, intent(in) :: Arg1, Arg2
      character(len=...), pointer :: Binary
    ...
    end function Binary

  end module Funcs

  program What

    use Funcs
    integer :: X = 42, Y

    read (10) .op. x, y

  end program What

Is "10" an <io-control-spec-list>, or is "(10) .op. x" a <format>?

Note that this program is valid Fortran 90, and "(10) .op. x" is
a <format> according to the Fortran 90 standard.

ANSWER:

It was an oversight that the programs in (1) and (2) conform to the
syntax and constraints in two different ways.

The problem stems from the over-ambitious extension of allowing
pointer function references to denote variables; this was unambiguous
for <function-reference> syntax, but is not for operator syntax.
Also, operator syntax has other restrictions on it that are intended
to prevent modification of an operand, and these are subverted if the
result is treated as a variable.

Edits are supplied to remove the treatment of pointer-valued operators
as variables.

EDITS:

[117:13] In 6.2, R602, change "<expr>" to "<function-reference>".

[117:15] In 6.2, C602,
         change "<expr> ... has"
         to "<function-reference> shall have".

  "C724a (R737) An <expr> shall be a reference to a function that has
                a data pointer result."

NUMBER: F08/0084
TITLE: Pointer arguments to PURE functions
KEYWORDS: PURE function, POINTER, INTENT(IN)
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

 Consider the following subprogram:

   Real Pure Function F( X )
     Real,Pointer :: X
     Real :: F
     f = 1.0
     x = 2.0    ! (A)
     Nullify(x) ! (B)
   End Function F

 This subprogram does not conform to Fortran 2003, because both
 statements (A) and (B) violate constraint C1272 which says
   "C1272 In a pure subprogram any designator with a base object that
          ... is a dummy argument of a pure function ... shall not be
          used ... [in] a variable definition context ...".

However, the corresponding constraint in Fortran 2008, C1283, is
missing the condition that applies the constraint to a dummy
argument of a pure function, except when it has INTENT(IN).  Thus
the statements marked (A) and (B) do not violate C1283, and
therefore this subprogram appears to conform to Fortran 2008.

Was this subprogram intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

No, this subprogram was not intended to be standard-conforming.
An edit is supplied to re-insert the omitted condition.

EDIT to 10-007r1:

[312:31] In 12.7, constraint C1283, after "association",
         insert ", is a dummy argument of a pure function".

TITLE: Problems with PARAMETERs
KEYWORDS: PARAMETER
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

(1) Consider the program fragment

    Subroutine s
      Parameter (n=1)
      Integer :: x,n       !(A)
      Parameter (x=3)

    The type declaration statement marked "!(A)", declares the
    entities X and N to be of type INTEGER.  Furthermore, as we by the
    immediately preceding and following PARAMETER statements, both X
    and N are named constants.

    Unfortunately, a constraint says
      C507 (R503) "An <initialization> shall appear if the entity is a
                   named constant (5.3.13)."
    (BTW, R503 is <entity-decl>.)

    Therefore one concludes that the type declaration statement marked
    "!(A)" is not conforming as it violates C507 for both X and N.

    Is this statement intended to be conforming?

(2) Firstly, consider

    Subroutine s2(n)
      Integer,Parameter :: x(n:n+1) = [ 1,2 ]
      Character(n),Parameter :: y = 'abc'
      ...

    The type declaration statements are not conforming because
    according to 5.2.2p1, X and Y are automatic data objects, and C506
    says that <initialization> shall not appear in that case.

    Now consider

    Subroutine s2b(n)
      Implicit Character(n) (a-z)
      Parameter (y = 'abc')
      Integer :: x(n:n+1)
      Parameter(x=[1,2])

    This is not valid Fortran 2003, because 5.2 contains the
    requirement:
      "The combination of attributes that may be specified for a
       particular entity is subject to the same restrictions as for
       type declaration statements regardless of the method of
       specification.  This also applies to PROCEDURE, EXTERNAL, and
       INTRINSIC statements."

    This requirement does not appear in F2008.  However, there is no
    indication in the Introduction of this new feature.

    Is this extension to Fortran 2003 deliberate?

ANSWER:

(1) Yes, the type declaration statement was intended to be allowed.
    An edit is supplied to correct this mistake.

(2) No, the omission of this requirement was inadvertent.  An edit
    is supplied to correct this mistake.

EDITS:

[88:14] In 5.2.1, Replace constraint "C507 (503)" completely with
  "C507 (R501) If the PARAMETER keyword appears, <initialization>
        shall appear in each <entity-decl>."
{Fix Q1.}

[88:14+] In 5.2.1, immediately after constraint C507, insert new
         constraint:

         expression."

NUMBER: F08/0086
TITLE: 	Implied-shape and separate PARAMETER statement
KEYWORDS: Implied-shape, PARAMETER
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification or Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Q1.  Consider

  Program test1
    Character(*) a,b(*)
    Dimension c(*)
    Parameter (a='123', b=['1','2','3'])
    Character(*),Parameter :: c = [ '44','55','66' ]
    Print *,a,b,c
  End 

The definition of the assumed-length character named constant A
conforms to Fortran 77 to Fortran 2008.  However, the definition of
the implied-shape named constant B appears not to conform to Fortran
2008, as the standard says in 5.4.11p2
  "A named array constant defined by a PARAMETER statement shall have
   its shape specified in a prior specification statement."
On the other hand, the named constant C does not have such a
requirement, so its definition would appear to be conforming.

This apparent requirement on the named constant B would thus appear to
be inconsistent with those on the named constant C, as well as
inconsistent with the way that assumed length works, and with the
general principle of allowing attributes to be specified either in a
single type declaration statement or with separate specification
statements.

Is the program intended to conform to the Fortran standard?

Q2. Consider

  Subroutine test2(a)
    Real,Dimension(*) :: a,b,c
    Integer,Parameter :: b = 123
    Parameter (c = 45.6)
    a(b) = c
  End Subroutine

The <array-spec> in the type declaration statement is ambiguous; if it
is an <implied-shape-spec> then the declaration of A as an
assumed-size array is erroneous, but if it is an <assumed-size-spec>
then the declarations of B and C as implied-shape arrays is erroneous.

Is this program-unit intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

A1.  No, the program is not intended to conform to the Fortran
     standard.  A clarifying edit is supplied to make it clear that an
     implied-shape array specification is only permitted for a named
     constant whose value is given in the same statement.  This makes
     it clear that the declarations of both B and C are non-conforming.

A2. No, the program is not intended to conform to the Fortran
    standard.  This is clarified by the same edit that clarifies the
    answer to question 1.

EDIT to 10-007r1:

[97:27+] In 5.3.8.6, insert new constraint
  "C535a An <implied-shape-spec> shall appear only in a type
         declaration statement in which the PARAMETER keyword
