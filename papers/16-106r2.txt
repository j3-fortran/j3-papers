To: J3
From: Dan Nagle
Subject: attempting UTI 015
Date: 2016 February 11

Reference: 16-007

The Editor remarks that the attributes of names listed
in LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT clauses are wrong.  Specifically,
some attributes are inconsistent with being a construct entity.
Others may be expensive to implement for little apparent gain,
or be so error-prone to use as to outweigh the benefits.

The straw votes changed somewhat from those proposed in 16-106.
Below is a summary:

1. Allocatable is to be disallowed.
2. Asynchronous and volatile are to be allowed, but transfers
must be complete before loop ends.
3. Target is to be allowed, but a clear statement of pointer
un-association is needed.
4. Types with final procedures are to be disallowed
5. Undefinable variables are to be disallowed.

UTI 015 is on pages 180-181 of 16-007.

While pondering deeply the issues raised hereby, we noticed
that clause 16 requires statements of various (un)definitions
introduced by LOCAL and LOCAL_INIT locality.

Edits

{these reflect Wednesday's straw votes}

This is all within subclause
8.1.6.5 Additional Semantics for DO CONCURRENT constructs,
[180:12-181:11] and concerns paragraph p2.
(That is, the discussion of LOCAL and LOCAL_INIT.)

[181:1] Replace "attributes"
with "type, type parameters (if any), and bounds (if any)"

{replace the erroneous attributes with necessary ones}

[181:3] After the sentence that ends with "within the construct."
add a paragraph break.
After the paragraph break, add a new paragraph:
"The variable with the same name as a variable with LOCAL or
LOCAL_INIT locality that is in the innermost executable
construct or scoping unit that includes the DO CONCURRENT construct
is the outer variable.  Additional rules apply to a variable that
has LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT locality:

o The variable has the ASYNCHRONOUS, CONTIGUOUS, POINTER, TARGET
or VOLATILE attribute(s) if and only if
the outer variable has the attribute(s).
o The variable does not have
the BIND, INTENT, PROTECTED, SAVE or VALUE attribute(s),
even if the outer variable has the attribute(s).
o The outer variable shall not have the ALLOCATABLE attribute
or be of finalizable type.
o If the outer variable cannot appear in a variable definition
context, it shall not appear in a LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT clause."

{list the allowable and problematic attributes separately}

[181:3+] add a new paragraph
"If a variable that has LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT locality becomes
an affector of a pending input/output operation, the operation
shall have completed before the end of the iteration.
If a variable has LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT locality
and has the TARGET attribute,
any pointers associated with it become undefined when the
iteration of the construct completes execution."

{clearly state the consequences of loop-scope variables}

[181:5] delete "is allocatable it is unallocated, if it"
from the bullet item.

[181:6] delete the comma after "status"

{make bullet item agree with preceding paragraphs}

[181:7] change "allocation, pointer association, and definition"
to "pointer association and definition"

{make bullet item agree with preceding paragraphs}

In 16.5.2.5
Events that cause the association status of pointers to become undefined

[497:13+] add a new numbered item to the list

"an iteration of a DO CONCURRENT construct completes and the pointer is
 associated with a LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT variable of that construct,"

{this is a new way for a pointer to lose association status}

In 16.6.5 Events that cause variables to become defined

[503:20+] add a new numbered item to the list

"when an iteration of a DO CONCURRENT construct begins,
 a LOCAL_INIT variable of that construct becomes defined
 with the value of the outer variable,"

{this is a new way for a variable to become defined}

In 16.6.6 Events that cause variables to become undefined

[505:10+] add a new numbered item to the list

"when an iteration of a DO CONCURRENT completes, a variable
 that is a construct entity of that construct, and which has
 LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT locality, becomes undefined."

{this is a new way for a variable to become undefined}
