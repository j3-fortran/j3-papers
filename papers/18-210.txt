Ballot Comment
--------------

In their DIS Ballot for draft N2146 of Fortran 2018, the GB comment
056 reads:

"The term "simply contiguous dummy variable" is undefined. Moreover as
described in NOTE 18.22 it is inconsistent with the current standard."


with the suggested edits:

In paragraph 5 change "simply contiguous dummy argument" to "dummy
argument which has the CONTIGUOUS attribute, or is an assumed-length
CHARACTER array and not a pointer, assumed-shape, or assumed-rank,".

Make the same change in paragraph 6.

Delete paragraph 7.

Delete NOTE 18.22

Add a new NOTE 18.22:

"If an interoperable C procedure whose Fortran interface has a dummy
argument which has the CONTIGUOUS attribute, or is an assumed-length
CHARACTER array and not a pointer, assumed-shape, or assumed-rank, is
invoked from C, the invoking routine is responsible for the contents
of the C descriptor which therefore might not describe a contiguous
data object."


Discussion
----------

Subgroup in principle agrees with the comment. We also modified the
edit as:

1. "simply contiguous dummy argument" can be replaced by "dummy
argument that is simply contiguous" so both terms are defined.

2. An interoperable assumed-length CHARACTER array cannot be
allocatable or pointer; An interoperable CHARACTER array that is
allocatable or pointer must have deferred length, so we removed the
"a pointer, ".
