Subject: Replace "points to" in TS 29113
From: Bill Long

Discussion:

UK comment GB21 replaces "result shall point to" by "result shall be
the address of". On pointing out that this wording pattern exists in
other places in the TS document, the Fortran standard editor requested
that the change be made uniformly in the TS.

There are two general patterns:

1) "xxx shall point to yyy" where xxx is the name of a pointer and yyy
is often "a C descriptor".  These should be changed to "xxx shall be
the address of yyy".

2) "yyy pointed to by xxx" where xxx is the name of a pointer and yyy
is often "a C descriptor". These should be changed to "yyy with the
address xxx".

Other cases occur with less frequency.

The edits below assume the similar edits in 11-231r1 have already been
applied, and hence they are not repeated here.




Edits to N1869:

These macros are used in the edits below, to avoid repeating the same
text multiple times.

E1(xxx) = Replace "xxx shall point to a C descriptor" with "xxx shall
be the address of a C descriptor".

E2(xxx) = Replace "C descriptor pointed to by xxx" with "C descriptor
with the address xxx".
