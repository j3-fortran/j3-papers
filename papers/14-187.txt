Subject: Editorial changes for 14-007r1
Date: 2014 June 09


1. Introduction

This paper contains editorial changes for 14-007r1.  No technical effects
are intended, except where a mistake in a previous "editorial" change had
an unintended technical effect.

However, some of the editorial changes do remove nonsensical, contradictory
or incorrect statements.  One might consider that to have technical effect.


2. Editorial (discussions)

(a) 4.3 has introductory material plus a single subclause, in violation of
    ISO guidelines.  Also, some of the subclause titles within 4.3 could be
    improved.

(b) 4.5.2.2p1 is redundant with 5.3.2p2.  The first two sentences although
    redundant are perhaps good introductory waffle before getting into p2
    and p3, but the last 2 sentences are completely unnecessary.

(c) Revised description of INDEX made a mistake when there is no matching
    string; previously this said to return zero, but the latest words say
    to return something different when BACK is true.

(d) "BIND(C)" is indexed in one place instead of simply "BIND".  This is
    not an attribute, nonetheless it is unhelpful to have different
    spelling for the same thing.

(e) 10.7.2.3.2 re the input form of a REAL is contradictory.  The first
    sentence denies the existance of an exponent part, then the final
    sentence tries to add the exponent part but does not say that it
    cannot follow an IEEE exceptional specification: that would permit
    monstrosities like InfinityE-200 and NaNE+50.

(f) We say for floating-point E-format editing, the fractional part
    "consists of" d digits and the exponent part "consists of" e digits,
    but that is not quite right: the fractional part also contains a
    decimal symbol and the exponent part also contains a sign.  It would
    be better to say "contains" rather than "consists of".

(g) Multiple uses of "should" and "recommend" in informative text.  In fact
    we are almost consistent in getting this wrong (there are more
    incorrectly-placed recommendations than there are correctly-placed
    ones.  These have been moved to a separate paper, along with (h), as
    there were so many of them.

(h) Multiple uses of "may" and "shall" in informative text.  This have been
    moved to a separate paper along with the (g) ones.

(i) Long ago we made an executive decision to make our usage of "I/O" and
    "input/output" consistent, and we decided to use "input/output".
    However, there are quite a few rogue "I/O"s still lurking.  Many (not
    all) of these are because of "I/O rounding mode"; this should be
    changed to "input/output rounding mode".

(j) c14 NOTE 14.3 is extremely problematic.  It starts out with a misworded
    conditional possibility (using the forbidden "may") of being
    inefficient and then goes into a direct statement of fact ... that
    appears to be untrue, unless by "esentially impossible" we mean "not
    actually impossible".  It goes further into some unrequired statements
    of intent or fact with the "processor will [not support some IEEE
    features]" that are likely untrue (the processor is likely to support
    what a sufficient number of users demand, even if it is a lot of
    work!), and in any case outwith the scope of the standard.

    This is followed by a direct (shall) requirement on the processor that
    not only violates the ISO directives, but looks to be outside the scope
    of the standard anyway.  Minor things like the antecedant of "others"
    not being entirely clear are mere icing on the cake.

    Since the whole note, apart from where it is wrong, is mere
    motivational witter plus programmer guidance, this should just be
    deleted.  If someone wants to rewrite the guidance into an acceptable
    form that can be done in a separate paper, but for now it needs to go.

(k) Note 15.10 contains wording about requirements.  Although this is
    not actually trying to impose requirements, there is no need to use
    that kind of wording anyway.  It can (and should) be reworded to avoid
    using the language for making requirements.

(l) C.6.6 Asynchronous input/output p7 uses very non-standard language and
    contains various statements that are misleading or not necessarily
    true.  I tried to convert this to more standard terminology without
    completely rewriting it.

(m) The constraint against adding LOCK_TYPE in an extended type that does
    not already have LOCK_TYPE prohibits the wrong things and just
    generally does not work.  To make this work it is useful to add a new
    term "potential subobject component".  This can then be used in NOTE
    12.52 instead of the convoluted language about (not) pointer components
    but maybe allocatable components at any level etc..

(n) The important text explaining what a subobject is in 6.4.2 "Structure
    components" is not indexed.


3. Typos

(1) 5.3.2p2 "is PUBLIC attribute".

(2) 16.6.8 Pointer association context
    "actual argument ... associated dummy"
    (the term is "corresponding dummy" for an actual argument).

(3) Cross-page continuation of Table 15.5 "ISO_Fortran_binding.h macros
    for error codes" is badly typeset.

(4) Non-hyphenation of "processor dependent" (except as an immediate
    modifying adjective) is not completely consistent.
