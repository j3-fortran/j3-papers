Subject: Integration of assumed-rank and C_SIZEOF

-----------

Paper 16-277r1 adds C_SIZEOF() to the list of intrinsics that allow an
assumed-rank argument. This was motivated by the fact that C_SIZEOF()
can be computed from the result of SIZE() with the same argument and
SIZE() now allows an assumed-rank argument.  Nick Maclaren pointed out
that for the case where an assumed-rank argument represents an
assumed-size array the result value is not specified in the
description of C_SIZEOF(). Indeed, C_SIZEOF() specifically does not
allow an assumed-size argument.

SIZE() does specify the result for case of an assumed-rank argument
that is associated with an assumed-size variable.  However, that
result is negative.  Relying on that special case would lead to a
negative result for C_SIZEOF() if it were computed by a product where
SIZE() is an operand. A negative value for C_SIZEOF() is incompatible
with its intended semantics of simulating sizeof() in C.

The Argument text for C_SIZEOF() needs to be modified to say that a
dummy argument that is assumed-rank cannot be argument-associated
with an assume-size array.

Note that this limitation is already stated in 17-007 in the
Introduction, paragraph 2, and the end of the item Features previously
described in ISO/IEC TS 29113:2012.

Edits to 17-007:
------------------

[488:24] In 18.2.3.7 C_SIZEOF ( ), paragraph 3, "Argument" after "that
is not an assumed-size array" insert " or an assumed-rank array that
is associated with an assumed-size array".
