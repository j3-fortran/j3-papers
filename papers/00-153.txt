Subject:  Corrections to 00-007

Matthijs pointed out in an email to me that the third edit from
paper 99-262r2 was not included in 00-007.  On verifying this, I
also noticed that the second edit was entered incorrectly and
that my note in 00-101 on this doesn't seem to match the edits.
I suspect that I got the two edits confused and was perhaps
trying to put the third edit in the place specified for the
second.  The following edits relative to 00-007 are to put the
words back as specified in 99-262r2.

[51:35] "have the SEQUENCE property or"
         -> "all have the SEQUENCE property or all have"

[51:38] After "the SEQUENCE property" insert
        "or with the BIND(C) attribute"
