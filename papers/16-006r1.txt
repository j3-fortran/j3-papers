Part 1: Interpretation Processing Rules
======================================================================

0. All interpretations are listed in J3 standing document 006.

1. Interpretations are processed by the J3/interp group and given a
   number.  The interpretation is marked "J3 consideration in
   progress".  An answer is formulated and presented to J3 in a
   meeting paper.

2. J3 votes on the answer at a J3 meeting; a simple majority vote
   marks the answer as "passed by J3 meeting".

3. Between J3 meetings the chair of /interp sends a J3 letter ballot
   to J3 to approve interp answers that have been "passed by J3
   meeting".  The letter ballot runs for 30 days.  An interp answer
   passes by a 2/3rds vote; a no vote must be accompanied by an
   explanation of the changes necessary to change the member's vote
   to yes.

   J3/interp reserves the right to recall an interp answer for more
   study even if the answer passes.

4. The chair of J3/interp gathers all interp answers that are marked
   "passed by J3 letter ballot" and forwards them to the WG5
   convenor.  The WG5 convenor holds a ballot of individual members;
   a no vote must be accompanied by an explanation of the changes
   necessary to change the member's vote to yes.  The answers that
   pass this ballot become "WG5 approved".

   J3/interp reserves the right to recall an interp answer for more
   study even if the answer passes.

5. "WG5 approved" answers are processed into a corrigendum document
   by taking the edits from the interp answers and putting them in
   the format required by ISO.  A WG5 vote is made on forwarding the
   corrigendum to SC22.  Interps so forwarded are marked
   "Corrigendum".

6. J3/interp creates a edit for the next Fortran Standard if one is
   needed for all interps marked "Corrigendum".

Part 2: Active F90/F95 interpretations
======================================================================

----------------------------------------------------------------------

NUMBER: F90/0145
TITLE: Expressions in <type-spec> of a FUNCTION statement
KEYWORDS: expression - specification, expression - initialization,
          FUNCTION statement, host association, use association
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

The syntax rule R1217 shows that the type and type parameters of a
function can be specified in the FUNCTION statement (12.5.2.2).

(a) If a <type-spec> appears in a FUNCTION statement, can the
initialization and specification expressions of that <type-spec>
involve names of entities that are declared within the function or
are accessible there by host or use association?

(b) Section 5.1 states:

      "The <specification-expr> (7.1.6.2) of a <type-param-value>
       (5.1.1.5) or an <array-spec> (5.1.2.4) may be a nonconstant
       expression provided the specification expression is in an
       interface body (12.3.2.1) or in the specification part of a
       subprogram."

As a FUNCTION statement is not part of the specification part of a
subprogram, this text in the standard appears to distinguish between
FUNCTION statements that are in interface blocks and ones that are
not. This text seems to prohibit such examples as:

         INTEGER I
          ...
         CONTAINS
           CHARACTER*(I+1) FUNCTION F()
              ...
              COMMON // I
              ...

where it can be confusing as to which I is being referenced in the
FUNCTION statement.  While host association does not apply to
interface bodies, for consistency should the text quoted from Section
5.1 have been "... is in the specification part of an interface body
(12.3.2.1) or in the specification part of a subprogram."?

(c) Section 7.1.6.1 states:

      "If an initialization expression includes a reference to an
       inquiry function for a type parameter or an array bound of an
       object specified in the same <specification-part>, the type
       parameter or array bound must be specified in a prior
       specification of the <specification-part>."

Was this text intended to apply to FUNCTION statements even though
they are not part of any <specification-part>, thus disallowing
fragments such as:

      INTEGER (KIND=KIND(X)) FUNCTION F()

Similar text appears in Section 7.1.6.2.

ANSWER:

(a) A specification expression in the <type-spec> of a FUNCTION
statement may involve names of entities that are declared within the
function or are accessible there by host or use association, but an
initialization expression in such a <type-spec> may only involve
names that are accessible by host or use association.

(b) No.  It was not the intent of the standard to distinguish between
the two types of FUNCTION statements cited.  As elaborated in the
discussion of part (a), the standard intended to allow the
<type-spec> expression of a FUNCTION statement to be a nonconstant
expression.  The sentence cited is corrected with a supplied edit.

(c) Yes, the text cited from 7.1.6.1 was intended to apply to
FUNCTION statements.  The sentence quoted and the corresponding
sentence in 7.1.6.2 are corrected with supplied edits.  The code
fragment is not standard conforming.

Discussion:

(a) An initialization expression is a constant expression with an
additional rule relating to exponentiation (7.1.6.1).  Since it is a
constant expression, the only names it can contain are the names of
named constants, structure constructors, intrinsic procedures, and
variables whose type parameters or bounds are inquired about.

    * Named constant

      Section 5.1.2.1 states:

       "A named constant must not be referenced in any ... context
        unless it has been defined in a prior PARAMETER statement or
        type declaration statement using the PARAMETER attribute, or
        made accessible by use association or host association."

      Since the FUNCTION statement is the first statement of the
      scoping unit, there can be no prior PARAMETER statement or type
      declaration statement using the PARAMETER attribute, so the
      first clause does not apply. A named constant can appear in a
      <type-spec> of a function statement if it is accessible within
      the function by host or use association.

    * Structure constructor

      Rule R502 shows that the only opportunities for expressions to
      appear in <type-spec>s are in a <kind-selector> or in a
      <char-selector>.  However, a structure constructor cannot
      appear in a <kind-selector> because rule R505 shows that a
      <kind-selector> must be an integer expression.  Similarly, R506
      shows that any initialization expression in a <char-selector>
      must be type integer.  Therefore, a structure constructor can
      not appear in an initialization expression in the <type-spec>
      of a FUNCTION statement.

    * Intrinsic procedure

      The intrinsic procedure names or classes of intrinsic
      procedures that may appear in an initialization expression are
      given in 7.1.6.1.

    * Variables whose type parameters or bounds are inquired about

      The text from section 7.1.6.1 as cited in question (c) was
      intended to apply to initialization expressions in the
      <type-spec> of a FUNCTION statement.  With the correction
      supplied, this means that if a variable appears as the argument
      to an inquiry intrinsic in the <type-spec> of a FUNCTION
      statement, the function must be a module procedure or an
      internal procedure, and the variable must exist in (be
      accessible from) the host scoping unit.

Rule R502 defines <type-spec>.  The only opportunity for a
<type-spec> to contain a <specification-expr> is when the data type
is character (<type-param-value> may be a <specification-expr>).
Section 7.1.6.2 states that a specification expression is a
restricted expression that is scalar, of type integer, and each
operation must be intrinsic.  In addition, rule (2) of 7.1.6.2 states
that a primary of a specification expression can be a dummy argument
that has neither the OPTIONAL nor INTENT(OUT) attribute.  The
following code fragment demonstrates a use of such a dummy argument:

              CHARACTER*(N+1) FUNCTION S(N)
              INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: N

Rule (2) also states that the primary can be a subobject of such a
dummy argument.  Section 6.1.2 indicates that a structure component
must not be referenced or defined before the declaration of the
parent object.  Similar rules are needed to prevent a substring from
being referenced ahead of the declaration of its parent, and an array
element or array section from being referenced ahead of the
declaration of the array.  Edits are provided to supply these rules.
Since a subobject cannot be referenced before its parent object is
declared and the FUNCTION statement is the first statement of the
subprogram, the parent's declaration could not have occurred.  Thus a
subobject must not be referenced in the <type-spec> on a FUNCTION
statement for objects declared within the function.

Rule (3) states that a primary can be a variable that is in a common
block.  The following code fragment demonstrates a use of such a
common block member:

              CHARACTER*(N+1) FUNCTION S()
              ...
              COMMON N

As in rule (2), rule (3) allows a subobject of such a variable but
for the same reasons as above, such a subobject designator cannot
appear in the <type-spec> expression of a FUNCTION statement.

Rule (4) states that a primary may be a variable that is accessible
by use association or host association.  The following code fragments
demonstrate uses of such variables:

              PROGRAM MAIN
              INTEGER :: N = 21
              ...
              CONTAINS
                CHARACTER(LEN = 2*N) FUNCTION SS(K)    ! N is host
                ...                                    !  associated.
                END FUNCTION
              END PROGRAM

    and

              MODULE MOD
              INTEGER K
              DATA K /20/
              END MODULE

              CHARACTER*(K*2) FUNCTION CHECK(STR)      ! K is use
                                                       !  associated.
              USE MOD
              ...
              END FUNCTION

Rule (4) also states that the primary can be a subobject of such a
use or host associated variable.

A structure constructor cannot appear in a FUNCTION <type-spec>
specification expression because the expression must be of type
integer and any operations (which might yield an integer value from
one or more structure constructors) must be intrinsic.

Other rules of 7.1.6.2 state which intrinsic procedure names or
classes of intrinsic procedures may appear in a specification
expression.

Section 7.1.6.2 also states:

        A variable in a specification expression must have its type
        and type parameters, if any, specified by a previous
        declaration in the same scoping unit, or by the implicit type
        rules currently in effect for the scoping unit, or by host or
        use association.

The discussion above regarding specification expressions has already
ruled out "previous declarations" so the first clause of the cited
sentence does not apply.  The other clauses apply equally to a
FUNCTION statement <type-spec> and to type declaration statements
inside the function.

(b) When the discussion for part (a) is applied to the code fragment
provided, it means that the 'I' referenced in the <type-spec> of the
FUNCTION statement is the common block member.

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

MODULE m

  TYPE t
    INTEGER :: i
    INTEGER :: j
  END TYPE

  INTEGER :: ipos

  INTERFACE READ(FORMATTED)
    MODULE PROCEDURE formattedReadT
  END INTERFACE

CONTAINS

  SUBROUTINE formattedReadT (dtv, unit, iotype, vlist, iostat, iomsg)
    CLASS(T), INTENT(INOUT) :: dtv
    INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: unit
    CHARACTER(*), INTENT(IN) :: iotype
    INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: vlist(:)
    INTEGER, INTENT(OUT) :: iostat
    CHARACTER(*), INTENT(INOUT) :: iomsg

    READ(unit, *) dtv%i
    INQUIRE(unit, POS=ipos)
    READ(unit, *) dtv%j
  END SUBROUTINE

END MODULE

PROGRAM foo
  USE m
  TYPE(t) :: a
  OPEN(10, FILE='file.txt', ACCESS='stream', FORM='formatted')
  WRITE(10, '(A)') '2*3 5'
  REWIND(10)
  READ(10, *) a
  PRINT *, a%i, a%j, ipos
END PROGRAM

10.9 of Fortran 2003 states that the r*c form of list-directed input
is equivalent to r occurrences of c.  So, when the read is performed,
it is as if the input record contains two occurrences of the number 3.

The first child read statement reads the first 3, and does not advance
the file position to the next record (because it is a child data
transfer statement).  It appears that the second read statement should
read the second 3.  But the file position between the child read
statements is unclear.

What does the above program print?

ANSWER:

The standard does specify the behavior of a processor when a list
directed input record contains a r*c constant, but that is irrelevant
to the question at hand.  Executing an INQUIRE statement using an
internal unit is prohibited by [235:16] 9.10.2.1p2.  The program does
not conform.

The question raised at m200 was about the definition of "internal unit
(9.6.4.8.3)" [226:4], which seems to conflict with the Terms and
Definitions [12:26-31]:

    1.3.94
     internal file
      character variable that is connected to an internal unit (9.4)

    1.3.95
     internal unit
      input/output unit that is connected to an internal file (9.5.4)

The clarification we needed but couldn't find is probably [208:8-10]:

    An internal unit is used to refer to an internal file and is
    specified by an internal-file-variable or a file-unit-number
    whose value is equal to the unit argument of an active defined
    input/output procedure (9.6.4.8).

  Rich Bleikamp's NO comment for F03/0059:

    The replacement text reads "if the variable would not be processed
    by a UDDTIO ...", but I think the presence of an object designator
    might actually determine whether or not the object designator is
    processed by a UDDTIO routine (sort of the reverse decision
    process than what is being suggested, where being processed by a
    UDDTIO routine precludes the use of a non-simple variable name in
    the input record).

    Second, the sentence immediately after the replaced text talks
    about "Successive qualifications" being applied to the name.  I
    think this reads awkwardly with the suggested edit.

    Third, I think the answer may be wrong.  For namelist input, we
    should allow (perhaps we already do) object designators all the
    time, and just not invoke the UDDTIO routine if the object
    designator is not a simple  variable name, or if the resulting
    objects datatype/shape do not match an existing interface for a
    UDDTIO routine.  Also, it's not clear to me (it's too late in the
    day), but perhaps we really want to allow an object designator
    that's an array element reference to invoke a UDDTIO routine.
    We could use the datatype and shape of the object designator to
    determine whether or not a UDDTIO routine should be invoked
    (still a compile time decision).  I'm not at all sure we'd want
    to allow component references in such a case, or perhaps a
    component reference in the input record just precludes the
    possibility of invoking a UDDTIO routine for that input value.

    The tradeoffs here are:
    1) allow some more functionality (which we may already allow),
       such as array element references appearing in a namelist input
       record (as a namelist group object name, possibly qualified),
       and still cause a UDDTIO routine to be invoked, and

    2) keep the rules simple enough that the user and compiler's I/O
      library can easily agree on what's supposed to happen, and
      what input values are therefore allowed.

    I was going to suggest a replacement edit, but my head hurts too
    much :).

TITLE: IEEE_SET_ROUNDING_MODE in a subroutine

STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Section 7.1.7 of the Fortran 2008 standard says that if the value of an
expression can be determined before execution of the program, it is
standard-conforming to use the predetermined value.

Consider the subprogram

        SUBROUTINE S()
        USE, INTRINSIC :: IEEE_ARITHMETIC
        USE, INTRINSIC :: IEEE_FEATURES

        INTEGER, PARAMETER :: sp = IEEE_SELECTED_REAL_KIND(6,30)
        real(sp) :: X = 0.5559013_sp
        real(sp) :: Y = 1.2092481_sp
        real(sp) :: Z1, Z2
        IF (IEEE_SUPPORT_ROUNDING(IEEE_NEAREST,X) .AND. &
            IEEE_SUPPORT_ROUNDING(IEEE_UP,X)) THEN
            CALL IEEE_SET_ROUNDING_MODE(IEEE_UP)
            Z1 = X*Y
            CALL IEEE_SET_ROUNDING_MODE(IEEE_NEAREST)

            PRINT *, 'Residual: ', Z1 - Z2
        ENDIF
        END

(1) Is a processor permitted always to print zero for the residual
    Z1 - Z2 ?
(2) Same question, after giving X and Y the PARAMETER attribute.

ANSWER:

(1) Yes.  The processor is allowed to evaluate expressions (constant
or otherwise) in any mathematically equivalent way.  In particular, it
is permitted to evaluate using higher precision than any precision
available when the program is executed.  For example, it might compute
Z1 == Z2 == 0.67222259081253, then compute Z1 - Z2 == 0.0, regardless
of how the program might do rounding at the seventh decimal digit when
it is executed.

(2) Yes, for the same reasons as question (1).

Bader NO vote:

The answers given to both (1) and (2) in the interp appear to me
to be counterintuitive; the programmer would expect that the
calculation of Z1 and Z2 respectively obey the imposed rounding
mode. In particular, I suspect there are situations where it is
more obvious to the compiler than to the programmer that expressions
are evaluated at compile time, and that different processors may
have differing capabilities in identifying such expressions. The
resolution of such situations is one target that the IEEE facilities
were designed for. I therefore am in favor of the stance that, if
supported, the setting of the rounding mode should take precedence
over processor-dependent compile-time evaluations.

Corbett NO vote:

I disagree with the interpretation given.  I believe that the
assignments should require conversions to be done and that the
conversions should be done in accord with the rounding mode
currently in effect.  Therefore, the results should not be zero.

Long NO vote:

I was confused by John's comment that the rounding mode on
entry to the subroutine affected the value of Z1 since the computation
of Z1 follows a call that resets the rounding mode.  I think the real
question here is what the standard means by "mathematical".  I had
always thought in terms of things like algebra.  John's answer seems
to imply that computational numerics (as specified by IEEE) are part
of the concept of "mathematical".  In other contexts, I think that
John's interpretation could be harmful.  On the other hand, the
current answer does seem to make the usefulness of the
IEEE_SET_ROUNDING_MODE routine more limited that would be
expected. Also, does the concept of mathematically equivalent apply to
the aggregation of multiple statements, or does it apply to just one
expression?  A processor that used the "mathematically equivalent"
argument to get 0 would need to forward sub the expressions for Z1 and
Z2 into the print statement to get X*Y - X*Y.  I don't think we
intended to allow forward substitution of expressions across one of
the IEEE mode setting routines.

Maclaren comment:

This relates to F03/0065, but is the other way round.  Unlike that one,
I consider this consistent with the majority of the semantic wording in
the C standard.

Muxworthy No vote:

I agree with John's vote.

Reid NO vote:

The IEEE rounding mode on entry to the procedure may vary from
call to call. The value of Z1 depends on this rounding mode.
Therefore, the processor should not always print zero for Z1-Z2.
Whether or not Z1 and Z2 have the PARAMETER attribute makes no
difference. Yes, the processor is allowed to evaluate an
expression in any mathematically equivalent way, but here the
mathematics dictates that a particular form of rounding, defined
in the IEEE standard, be applied.

Snyder NO vote:

    The answer makes rounding mode changes pointless.

    The work-around usually advanced to cause rounding mode changes to
    have effect (but not advanced in the answer to the interpretation)
    is to store intermediate results that are computed with different
    rounding modes in VOLATILE variables if they are ultimately to be
    combined in a single expression.

    Subclause 5.3.19 states, in part, however, that "The VOLATILE
    attribute specifies that an object may be referenced, defined, or
    become undefined, by means not specified by the program."  Setting
    the rounding mode is done by means that ARE specified by the
    program, so the advice is not germane.  One who reads subclauses
    5.3.19, 14.4, 14.11.6, and 14.11.21, and the answer to this
    interpretation, might not realize that the use of VOLATILE variables
    is required, under the present interpretation, for subclauses 14.4,
    14.11.6, and 14.11.21 to be meaningful.

    A better answer would have been to amend 7.1.5.2.4 to require that
    all entities within the expression are evaluated with the same
    rounding mode, or to specify that quantities evaluated with
    different rounding modes cannot be considered to be mathematically
    equivalent, even if evaluated by textually identical expressions.
    This might require processors either to abandon certain
    optimizations, or to perform more detailed dataflow analysis that
    propagates rounding mode to determine when those optimizations are
    permitted.

    If the position implied by the answer to this interpretation is to
    be maintained, the absence of edits is entirely inadequate.  The
    definition of VOLATILE must be changed to encompass actions that ARE
    specified by the program, and to encompass advice concerning
    rounding mode changes.  Advice to store intermediate results that
    are computed with different rounding modes into VOLATILE variables,
    if they are to be combined in a single expression, must be included
    in subclauses 14.4 and 14.11.21.

    During the requirements phase for the 2008 standard, there was a
    request (in 04-219) for a "strict mode" similar to that described in
    section G.2 of the Ada standard, in which rounding mode settings
    would actually have an effect without needing to resort to VOLATILE
    variables.  If a "strict mode" had been provided, it might have made
    sense to allow a processor to ignore rounding mode changes outside
    strict regions.  A request for a "strict mode" will be presented
    during the requirements-gathering phase for the next revision of the
    standard, for this as well as other reasons.

No it does not.  IEEE peculiarities play no part in the mathematical
Reals.

IEEE is merely one form of computer arithmetic.  (It would make very
bad mathematics, since IEEE numbers are not even a subset of the
2-point compactification of the Reals, thus nearly all mathematical
identities and theorems about the Reals would get destroyed.)  Computer
arithmetic is *computational* not *mathematical*.  ALL computer
arithmetics frequently give different computational answers for
mathematically-equivalent expressions.

And I cannot believe you are again trotting out this nonsense saying
constant expressions should not be treated as constant.  If I have
   "REAL(KIND=INT(a+b)) :: x(INT(a+b)) = a+b; y=a+b",
with a and b being floating-point named constants, I am not allowed
to evaluate a+b at compile time?  Surely you jest.  Or I can in the
KIND= but not in the array bound?  Unless the array is in COMMON or
has the SAVE attribute?  Surely you jest even more.  Or I can
everywhere except in the "y ="?  You cannot be serious.

Furthermore, the rationale you are using is applicable to all routines
regardless of whether they call IEEE_SET_ROUNDING and would thereby
destroy many basic optimisations.  You.Really.Can.Not.Be.Serious.

NUMBER: F03/0121
TITLE: Precise FP semantics of the REAL intrinsic
KEYWORDS: REAL intrinsic
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting 

QUESTION:

Must the intrinsic function REAL with KIND argument wp return a value
that is a REAL (KIND=wp) floating point number?

RATIONALE FOR THE QUESTION:

Computer hardware may use a wider floating-point format for registers
than for memory; e.g., 80 bits for registers and 64 bits for memory
for the case of standard double precision floating point numbers. Some
algorithms require a high level of control over floating point
semantics.  If the intrinsic function REAL with KIND parameter wp is
guaranteed to return a REAL (KIND=wp) result then a programmer can use
this to force intermediate results into main memory format, never mind
that the optimizing compiler may have placed the intermediate in a
register.

I am interested in a J3 interpretation of this matter, especially a
loud and clear affirmative interpretation, because it appears that
some present Fortran compilers optimize away my explicit use of the
REAL intrinsic with a KIND=wp argument.  The context is code for
compensated summation (Kahan summation).  I appreciate that
parentheses are inviolable courtesy of the Fortran standard, but in
order to have code that cannot be broken by an optimizing compiler I
seem to need also a language mechanism to force intermediate results
into main memory format.  The VOLATILE attribute is a large hammer,
and the standard does not actually say that assigning a value to a
variable with that attribute forces the result to main memory format.

ANALYSIS:

The fourth sentence of the second paragraph of subclause 13.7.1, as
amended by Corrigendum 2, states:

   "A program is prohibited from invoking an intrinsic procedure under
    circumstances where a value to be returned in a subroutine
    argument or function result is outside the range of values
    representable by objects of the specified type and type
    parameters."

However common optimizations have allowed the REAL intrinsic to be
ignored in an expression when the result is mathematically equivalent
to including the evaluation of the REAL intrinsic.  Requiring the
evaluation of the REAL intrinsic in all circumstances would be adding a
new feature, incompatible with existing F2008 interpretations, and would
be limiting optimizations on which Fortran customers rely.

ANSWER:

10-007r1 [141:20-21] 7.1.5.2.4p2, says:

   "Once the interpretation of a numeric intrinsic operation is
    established, the processor may evaluate any mathematically
    equivalent expression, provided that the integrity of parentheses
    is not violated."

The interpretation of this paragraph has always meant that the REAL
intrinsic may return a mathematically equivalent result.  The interp
process must not be used to add a new feature, incompatible with existing
practice.

NUMBER: F08/0029
TITLE: G0 edit descriptor and floating-point output
KEYWORDS: G edit descriptor, 0 width
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

For data types other than floating-point, the effect of the G0 edit
descriptor is precisely defined.  For floating-point output, the
effect is precisely defined only if the value is an IEEE NaN or
Infinity, the result is otherwise left up to the processor to select
"reasonable" values for w, e, and d (if d is unspecified).

The standard states [258:7-9 10.7.5.2.2p2]:

      "the G0 and G0.d edit descriptors follow the rules for the
       Gw.dEe edit descriptor, except that any leading or trailing
       blanks are removed".

One might deduce from the wording of this that there is no upper limit
on the choice of w, since the production of additional leading (or
trailing) blanks has no effect on the output.

Q1. Is a value for w or e that results in the field being filled with
    asterisks reasonable?  This is not, after all, an error condition.

Q2. Is a value for d that results in significant loss of precision
    reasonable?  E.g. d==1, or for a less extreme example,
    d==PRECISION(value)/2.

Q3. Is a value for d that produces many more digits than the precision
    reasonable?  E.g. d==1000000.  Or, for a less extreme example,
    d==PRECISION(quad) with a single precision value.

Q4. Is a value for e that produces many more digits in the exponent
    than the exponent range reasonable?  E.g. e==1000000.

Q5. If the standard cannot tell me what "reasonable" means, what
    purpose does it serve for it to say that it must be reasonable?
    I cannot see how to tell whether a processor conforms to the
    standard in this respect.

DISCUSSION:

The standard permits, but does not require, the "best" values of w, d
or e to be chosen for each internal value.

ANSWER:

A1. No, that is not reasonable.  An edit is supplied to clarify the
    meaning of "reasonable".

A2. No, a value of d that results in a significant loss of precision
    is not reasonable.  An edit is supplied to correct this.

A3. No, it is not reasonable for d to be ridiculously large.
    An edit is supplied to clarify the intent.

A4. No, e should not be bigger than that required to represent the
    largest finite machine-representable number.  An edit is
    supplied to specify this.

A5. Yes, the use of the word "reasonable" in this context is entirely
    meaningless.  An edit is supplied to remove this misleading
    terminology.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

In 10.7.5.2.2, paragraph 2:

[258:9] In 10.7.5.2.2p2 last sentence:
  "Reasonable processor-dependent" -> "Processor-dependent".
{A5.}

[258:10] In 7.5.2.2p2 last sentence, after "value" insert
  ", that do not result in the field being filled with asterisks".
{A1.}

[258:10] Append new sentences to 10.7.5.2.2p2:
  "The value of <d> shall not result in the production of an output
   value that differs from the internal value by more than
   100*SPACING(value), and shall not be more than two larger than the
   maximum number of digits that might be required to distinguish
   between two different machine numbers of the kind of the internal
   value.  The value of <e> shall not be so large that the exponent
   would have a leading zero both when the internal value is the
   largest finite machine number and when it is the smallest finite
   machine number of that kind."
{The first sentence limits the choice of <d> to lose no more than 2
 digits of precision (A2) and to have no more than 2 spurious digits
 of  precision (A3); for some floating-point formats, the upper bound
 is not strong, being d <= 2+MAX(PRECISION(value)+2,RANGE(value)*2).
 The second sentence would allow e==4 for a lop-sided exponent range,
 e.g. -1100 to +900, but would limit e to at most 3 if the exponent
 range is e.g. -308 to +308 (A4).
 Neither of these restrictions prevent a processor from producing
 fewer mantissa or exponent digits for particular values if that does
 not result in serious loss of accuracy.}

Corbett NO vote:
I agree that the word "reasonable" should not appear in the
Fortran standard.  The first two proposed edits should be
incorporated.  The third edit should not be adopted.

I object to the third edit on general grounds.  The issues dealt
within the third edit should be matters of "quality of
implementation."  I see no reason for the Fortran standard to
restrict implementors' choices in this area.

I also object to the third edit on specific grounds.  The
proposed edit makes no provision for nonzero scale factors.  If
a nonzero scale factor is in effect, an implementation might
reasonably choose a value of d that is outside the range
specified by the edit, if only to avoid the scale factor being
outside the allowed range of values.

TITLE:  Segment ordering rules
KEYWORDS: segment, allocation
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

(1) Was it intended to allow the allocation of a variable that is not
    a subobject of a coarray to be unordered with respect to its
    definition by another image through a pointer component of a
    coarray?

For example,

  PROGRAM example1
    TYPE t1
      REAL,ALLOCATABLE :: c(:)
    END TYPE
    TYPE t2
      TYPE(t1),POINTER :: p
    END TYPE
    TYPE(t1),TARGET :: x
    TYPE(t2) :: y[*]
    y%p => x                         ! y[n]%p => x[n] for all n.
    SYNC ALL
    IF (THIS_IMAGE()==1) THEN
      ALLOCATE(x%c(1000))            ! Allocates x[1]%c.
    ELSE
      y[1]%p%c(THIS_IMAGE()) = 999   ! Defines some part of x[1]%c.
    END IF
  END PROGRAM

(2) If a variable is already defined (initially or by some segment
    that precedes all other segments in this question), may one image
    reference it while another image causes it to become undefined in
    unordered segments?

For example, is

  PROGRAM example2
    REAL :: x(100)[*]
    x = 1
    SYNC ALL
    IF (THIS_IMAGE()==1) THEN
      PRINT *,SUM(x)
    ELSE
      CALL destroy(x)
    END IF
  CONTAINS
    SUBROUTINE destroy(x)
      REAL,INTENT(OUT) :: x(:)
    END SUBROUTINE
  END PROGRAM

standard-conforming?  This does not appear to violate any of the
segment ordering requirements in 8.5.2 because it is not defined in
any unordered segment (so bullet 1 does not apply), there is no
allocation or pointer association status (so bullet 2 does not apply),
and there is no dummy argument being defined (so bullet 3 does not
apply).

ANSWER:

(1) No, this example violates the requirement of the first bullet in
    paragraph 3 of 8.5.2, which says:
      "if a variable is defined on an image in a segment, it shall not
       be referenced, defined, or become undefined in a segment on
       another image unless the segments are ordered".
    x[1]%c is defined in segment 2 by images 2-N, but is made
    undefined on image 1 (allocation makes a variable undefined except
    when default initialization occurs).

(2) No, this example was not intended to be standard-conforming.  An
    edit is supplied to clarify the intent.

  John Reid's NO vote on F08/0041:

    There are errors in both examples. In example (1), the component of
    type t2 should have type t1. In example (2), the PRINT statement
    should reference x on another image, e.g. PRINT *, x(1)[2].

    More seriously, the edit proposed in 10-201 has been removed. While
    it is not necessary for allocation, it is needed for pointer
    association.  This means that it is desirable to rewrite the
    questions and answers.  Here is my suggestion

    QUESTION:

    (1) If a variable is already defined (initially or by some segment
        that precedes all other segments in this question), may one

      CONTAINS
        SUBROUTINE destroy(x)
          REAL,INTENT(OUT) :: x(:)
        END SUBROUTINE
      END PROGRAM

    standard-conforming?  This does not appear to violate any of the
    segment ordering requirements in 8.5.2 because it is not defined in
    any unordered segment (so bullet 1 does not apply), there is no
    allocation or pointer association status (so bullet 2 does not

    (2) Was it intended to allow a pointer assignment to a pointer that
        is not a subobject of a coarray to be unordered with respect to
        its definition by another image through a pointer component of
        a coarray?

** start negative comments
  Jim Xia's No vote on F08/0045:

    The edits makes it illegal to specify LOCK_TYPE as <type-spec> if
    the coarray itself is of LOCK_TYPE.  For example,
      type(lock_type), allocatable :: locks[*]
    The edits make the following allocate statement illegal
      ALLOCATE (LOCK_TYPE: locks[*])

  result of ballot on F08/0045:

TITLE:  Variable-denoting function references change existing
        semantics
KEYWORDS: Pointer function, argument, ASSOCIATE, SELECT TYPE
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Questions 1-3 use this module:

  Module m200c2
    Integer,Target :: x = 42
  Contains
    Function fx()
      Integer,Pointer :: fx
      fx => x
    End Function
  End Module

Q1. Consider this main program

  Program q1
    Use m200c2
    Call test(x,fx())                  ! The call.
  Contains
    Subroutine test(a,b)
      Integer :: a,b
      a = a*10                         ! The assignment.
      Print *,a,b
    End Subroutine
  End Program

According to Fortran 2003, "fx()" in the CALL statement is an
expression and not a variable, and has the value 42.  It follows
that the assignment "a = a*10" is standard-conforming and does
not affect the value of B.  Therefore this program prints
 420 42

However, according to Fortran 2008, "fx()" in the CALL statement is a
variable, and therefore the assignment does not conform to the
standard because it affects the value of B and so violates 12.5.2.13
item (3) which requires all updates to B to go through the dummy
argument, and therefore the behaviour of the program is unspecified.

This conflicts with the statement in clause 1 that all Fortran 2003
programs remain conforming in Fortran 2008.

Is this program intended to remain standard-conforming?

Q2. Consider this main program

  Program q2
    Use m200c2
    Call test(x,fx())                  ! The call.
  Contains
    Subroutine test(a,b)
      Integer,Target :: a,b
      a = a*10                         ! The assignment.
      Print *,a,b
    End Subroutine
  End Program

According to Fortran 2003, "fx()" in the CALL statement is an
expression and not a variable, and has the value 42.  It follows
that the assignment "a = a*10" is standard-conforming and does
not affect the value of B.  Therefore this program prints
 420 42

However, according to Fortran 2008, "fx()" in the CALL statement is a
variable, and therefore the assignment to A affects the value of B, so
the program will print
 420 420

This apparently conflicts with the statement in clause 1 that Fortran
2008 is an upwards compatible extension to Fortran 2003.

Is this program intended to have altered semantics?

Q3. Consider this main program

  Program q3
    Use m200c2
    Associate(y=>fx())   ! The association.
      x = 0              ! The assignment.
      Print *,x,y
    End Associate
  End Program

This main program apparently conforms to both Fortran 2003 and Fortran
2008, but according to Fortran 2003 "fx()" in the association is an
expression, evaluated on entry to the construct, and therefore Y
becomes associated with the value 42, and therefore the program prints
the values (spacing may differ)

 0 42

whereas according to Fortran 2008 "fx()" in the association is a
variable, and every reference to Y is a reference to the associated
variable, so the assignment also changes the value of Y and therefore
the program prints the values

 0 0

This apparently conflicts with the statement in clause 1 that Fortran
2008 is an upwards compatible extension to Fortran 2003.

Is this program intended to have altered semantics?

Q4. Consider this program

  Module m200c2_q4
    Integer,Target :: x = 42
  Contains
    Function fx()
      Class(*),Pointer :: fx
      fx => x
    End Function
  End Module
  Program q4
    Use m200c2_q4
    Select Type (q=>fx())
    Type Is (Integer)
      x = 0
      Print *,x,q
    End Select
  End Program

Using the same logic as Q2, this should print the values
 0 42
in Fortran 2003, but the values
 0 0
in Fortran 2008.

Again, this is not upwards compatible with Fortran 2003.

Is this program intended to have altered semantics.

-----------------------
From N1990: F08/0089

Corbett reason for NO vote

Questions Q1 and Q2 assume that if a pointer actual argument
has the form of an expression and the corresponding dummy
argument is a nonpointer dummy argument without the VALUE
attribute, the dummy argument becomes argument associated
with the value of the target of the value of the pointer
actual argument.  On the newsgroup comp.lang.fortran, Ian
Harvey pointed out that the Fortran standards do not support
that premise.  Paragraph 2 of Clause 12.5.2.3 of the
Fortran 2008 standard states

     If a nonpointer dummy argument without the VALUE
     attribute corresponds to a pointer actual argument
     that is pointer associated with a target, the
     dummy argument becomes argument associated with
     that target.

Paragraph 8 of Clause 12.4.1.2 of the Fortran 2003 standard
states

     Except in references to intrinsic inquiry functions,
     if the dummy argument is not a pointer and the
     corresponding actual argument is a pointer, the
     actual argument shall be associated with a target
     and the dummy argument becomes argument associated
     with that target.

Paragraph 6 of Clause 12.4.1.1 of the Fortran 95 standard
states

     If the dummy argument is not a pointer and the
     corresponding actual argument is a pointer, the
     actual argument shall be currently associated
     with a target and the dummy argument becomes
     argument associated with that target

The paragraph added between paragraphs 3 and 4 of
Clause 12.4.1.1 of the Fortran 90 standard by
Corrigendum 2 states

     If the dummy argument is not a pointer and the
     corresponding actual argument is, the actual
     argument must be currently associated with a
     target and the dummy argument becomes argument
     associated with that target.

That text was added as a result of interpretation
F90/000039.

In the examples given in questions Q1 and Q2, the
actual argument fx() is a pointer actual argument
corresponding to a nonpointer dummy argument.
Therefore, the dummy argument becomes argument
associated with the target of the pointer actual
argument, which is the module variable x.  The dummy
argument does not become argument associated with the
value of the target of the pointer.  Thus, there is
no semantic difference between Fortran 2008 and the
previous standards in this regard.

The answers and edits given for questions Q1 and Q2 are
based on the same premise as the questions themselves
and should be rejected.

I asked people to compile and run the example programs
given in questions Q1 and Q2 and variations of them
using a variety of compilers.  In most, but not all,
cases, the results were consistent with the semantics
stated in the Fortran standards, not with the semantics
assumed by questions Q1 and Q2.

Questions Q3 and Q4 are consistent with the standards,
as are the corresponding answers and edits, but I do not
care for the nature of the changes that will result if
interpretation F08/0075 is passed.  I think changing the
language so that the form of a function reference
determines its meaning is a mistake.

Long comment:

Twice in the edits appears "...a <function-reference> to a
pointer function is regarded as a variable...". Should this
be a "data pointer function"?

Snyder comment:

The term "pointer function" is not used as a noun,
although "nonpointer function" is so used at [454:36].
I have a slight preference that "pointer function" in
the edit for [24:11+] be replaced by "function that
returns a pointer result" in both paragraphs.  The
same change ought to be made in the edits for [24:27+]
and [25:6+]

A parallel change ought to be made at [454:36], but
that can be done editorially rather than within this
interpretation.

NUMBER: F08/0107
TITLE: LOCK_TYPE, ultimate components, subcomponents, and coarrays
KEYWORD: LOCK_TYPE, ultimate components, subcomponents, coarrays
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

DISCUSSION:

Constraint C433 in subclause 4.5.2.1 reads:

C433 (R425) If EXTENDS appears and the type being defined has an
  ultimate component of type LOCK_TYPE from the intrinsic module ISO
  FORTRAN ENV, its parent type shall have an ultimate component of type
  LOCK TYPE.

This was intended to prevent compromising protection of objects of type
LOCK_TYPE by using type extension and polymorphism.

According to subclause 1.3.33.4, an ultimate component is a

  component that is of intrinsic type, a pointer, or allocatable; or an
  ultimate component of a nonpointer nonallocatable component of derived
  type

The type LOCK_TYPE is not intrinsic.  Therefore, if a type has a
nonallocatable component of type LOCK_TYPE, it does not have an ultimate
component of type LOCK_TYPE.  Therefore, constraint C433 fails to
protect entities of type LOCK_TYPE.

Constraint C433 prohibits reasonable constructions, such as extending
the type LOCK_TYPE, or extending a type that has an allocatable
component that has a component of type LOCK_TYPE, because the parent
type does not have an ultimate component of type LOCK_TYPE.

Constraint C1302 in subclause 13.8.2.16 reads:

C1302 A named variable of type LOCK TYPE shall be a coarray. A named
  variable with a noncoarray subcomponent of type LOCK TYPE shall be a
  coarray.

This was intended to require that components of type LOCK_TYPE, at any
level of component selection, be coarrays.

According to subclause 1.3.33.3, a subcomponent is a

  <structure> direct component that is a subobject of a structure

According to subclause 1.3.33.1, a direct component is

  one of the components, or one of the direct components of a nonpointer
  nonallocatable component.

The definition of the term "subcomponent" does not include components of
allocatable components.  Therefore, because of the use of the term
"subcomponent," if an object has an allocatable component that in turn
has a component of type LOCK_TYPE, C1302 can fail to require a component
of type LOCK_TYPE to be a coarray.

QUESTIONS:

Assume type LOCK_TYPE from ISO_Fortran_Env is accessible.

1. Is the definition of type One below standard conforming?

type, extends(LOCK_TYPE) :: One
  type(lock_type), allocatable :: LOCK
end type One

2. Is the definition of type Four below standard conforming?

type :: Two
  type(lock_type), allocatable :: LOCK[:]
end type Two

type :: Three
  type(two), allocatable :: L
end type Three

Type, extends(Three) :: Four
  type(lock_type), allocatable :: LOCK[:]
end type Four

3. Is the definition of type Six below standard conforming?

type :: Five
end type Five

type, extends(Five) :: Six
  type(two), allocatable :: L
end type Six

4. Is the declaration of the variable X below standard conforming?

  type :: Seven
    type(lock_type) :: L
  end type Seven

  type :: Eight
    type(seven), allocatable :: C
  end type Eight

  type(eight) :: X

ANSWERS:

1. According to 9.12p5 [243:3-5]

  "The value of a specifier in an input/output statement shall not
  depend on the definition or evaluation of any other specifier in the
  <io-control-spec-list> or <inquire-spec-list> in that statement."

the INQUIRE statements are prohibited because the values of the
variables EXIST and OPENED depend upon the values of the FILE= and
UNIT= specifiers, respectively.  They were intended to be permitted.
Edits are provided to correct this mistake.

2. According to 9.12p6 [243:6-8]

  "The value of any subscript or substring bound of a variable that
  appears in a specifier in an input/output statement shall not depend
  on any <input-item>, <io-implied-do> <do-variable>, or on the
  definition or evaluation of any other specifier in the
  <io-control-spec> or <inquire-spec> in that statement."

the INQUIRE statement is not prohibited because U is not a subscript
or substring bound.

According to 7.1.4p2 [139:3-4]

  "The evaluation of a function reference shall neither affect nor be
   affected by the evaluation of any other entity within the
   statement."

the INQUIRE statement is not prohibited because, although U is
assigned a value, it is not evaluated.

The INQUIRE statement was intended to be prohibited.  Edits are
provided to correct this mistake.

3. According to 9.12p6 [243:6-8]

  "The value of any subscript or substring bound of a variable that
  appears in a specifier in an input/output statement shall not depend
  on any <input-item>, <io-implied-do> <do-variable>, or on the

  its subscript values shall not be affected by the data transfer, the
  <io-implied-do> processing, or the definition or evaluation of any
  other specifier in the <io-control-spec-list>."

the READ statement is not prohibited because V does not "depend on any
<input-item>, <io-implied-do> <do-variable>, or on the definition or
evaluation of any other specifier in the <io-control-spec> or
<inquire-spec> in that statement."   Although V is input from

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[243:3-5 9.12p5] Within the second sentence, provided by Corrigendum

Append ", or be affected by data transfer caused by that statement".
That sentence becomes

a variable" with "denotation of a data object".  Replace "depend ...

  this includes such things as component selection, array element
  selection, and pointer function evaluation.

Malcolm:
 I'm sorry, but this draft corrigendum makes 9.12p5 say
   "The value of an \si{internal-file-variable} ... shall not ... be 
   affected by data transfer caused by that statement."
 And yet, this is the ENTIRE PURPOSE of a WRITE to an internal file, 
 to affect the value of the internal-file-variable by means of data 
 transfer!
 
 It is clear that we cannot cover everything in a single sentence, 
 since the requirements on input and output statements should be quite 
 different.  More words are needed.

 (20) The edits for F08/0110 need to be pulled (see previous message), 
 but anyway, the edit instructions refer to the "fifth paragraph, 
 provided by Technical Corrigendum 2", but in fact the fifth paragraph 
 was NOT "provided" by corrigendum 2, but merely edited by it.  So 
 those instructions should be "fifth paragraph, as edited by Technical 
 Corrigendum 2" (or "after applying the changes in ...", which phrasing 
 you used elsewhere).



Result:
 All 9.12 edits are from F08/0110 which is being pulled from Corr 4:

  Remove the edits for F08/0110: [243:3-5, 6-7, 9, 12-14].  F08/0110

ANSWERS:

1. Item (1) in subclause 16.6.6 says

  "When a scalar variable of intrinsic type becomes defined, all totally
  associated variables of different type become undefined....  When a
  scalar variable becomes undefined, all partially associated double
  precision scalar variables become undefined."

D is not totally associated with I.  I does not become undefined.
Therefore, D does not become undefined.  D ought to become undefined.
Edits are provided to correct this mistake.

2. Item (1) in subclause 16.6.6 says

  "When a double precision scalar variable becomes defined, all
  partially associated scalar variables become undefined."

P is partly associated with C, and therefore C becomes undefined by the
assignment to the scalar variable P.  C ought not to become undefined.
Edits are provided to correct this mistake.

3. Item (1) in subclause 16.6.6 says

  "When a scalar variable becomes undefined, all partially associated
  double precision scalar variables become undefined."

  Subclause 16.6.1p5 says

  "A complex... scalar object is defined if and only if all of its
  subobjects are defined."

The association of the scalar variable D2 with an INTENT(OUT) dummy
argument causes it become undefined.  16.6.6p1(1) does not specify that
when a scalar real variable becomes undefined, a totally associated part
of a complex variable becomes undefined.  Assuming C%IM ought to become
undefined, then C ought to become undefined, even though C%RE is not
undefined.  D1 is associated with the C%RE, and therefore becomes
undefined when C%IM becomes undefined.  C%IM ought to become undefined,
and D1 ought not to become undefined.  Edits are provided to correct
this mistake.

4. Item (1) in subclause 16.6.6 says

  "When a scalar variable of intrinsic type becomes defined, all totally
  associated variables of different type become undefined.

X and Y are totally associated, and of different type, but neither one is
of intrinsic type.  Therefore, Y does not become undefined as a
consequence of X becoming defined.  Y ought to become undefined.  Edits
are provided to correct this mistake.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

In Subclause 16.6.6p1, item(1), within the first sentence, remove "of
intrinsic type".  Before "different" insert "the same type with
different values of kind type parameters, or of"

In Subclause 16.6.6p1, replace item(1) with the following four sentences
(all in one paragraph)

  "When a scalar variable becomes defined, all totally associated
  variables of different type become undefined.

{Removing "of intrinsic type" from the existing first sentence of
16.6.6p1(1) addresses question 4.}

  When a scalar variable becomes defined, all partially associated
  variables of different type, or of the same type if corresponding kind
  type parameters have different values, become undefined, unless the
  scalar variable is totally associated with a subobject of the
  partially associated variable, that subobject is of the same type as
  the scalar variable, and corresponding kind type parameters have the
  same values.

{This addresses questions 1 and 2.  The references to kind type
parameter values address the possibility of partially associating a
double precision variable with a default real variable.  Default real
and double precision are now the same type (since 1990), but with a
different kind type parameter value.}

  When a scalar variable becomes undefined, all partially associated
  variables become undefined, unless the partially associated variable
  is totally associated with a subobject of the scalar variable that
  does not become undefined.

  When a scalar variable becomes undefined, all totally associated
  subobjects of other variables become undefined if those subobjects are
  of different type from the scalar variable, or corresponding kind type
  parameters have different values."

TITLE: Can LOCK_TYPE components have the POINTER attribute?
KEYWORD: LOCK_TYPE component, POINTER
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

Assume LOCK_TYPE is accessible from ISO_Fortran_Env.

QUESTION:

The following type definition and variable declaration are permitted by
C1302:

  type :: One
    type(lock_type), pointer :: L
  end type One

  type(one), allocatable :: L1[*]

C1302 requires a named variable of LOCK_TYPE to be a coarray.  C526
requires a coarray to be allocatable or to have the SAVE attribute.

The following declaration is apparently prohibited because L4 is
not a coarray:

  type(lock_type), pointer :: L4

Was it intended that pointer components of type LOCK_TYPE be permitted,
but that named variables of type LOCK_TYPE with the POINTER attribute be
prohibited?

ANSWER:

It was intended that components of type LOCK_TYPE not be permitted to
have the POINTER attribute.  Edits are provided to correct this mistake.

  Malcolm Cohen's No vote on F08/0114:

    This is just the wrong decision.  People use pointers for all
    kinds of reasons, e.g. switching between two different structures,
    emulating optionality, etc.  We allow pointers to be followed
    cross-image from a coarray, which means that pointers with a
    potential subobject of type LOCK_TYPE would indeed be useful
    in such scenarios.

    We should not add this new restriction; rather, we should remove
    the misguided "style preference" that is currently badly expressed
    by C1302.

  Robert Corbett's yes vote with Comment on F08/0114:

    I find the text of the proposed edit difficult to read.  I prefer

TITLE: Definition of objects of type LOCK_TYPE with pointer subobjects
KEYWORD: pointer subobject, variable definition context, LOCK_TYPE
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Does the following conform to the Fortran 2008 standard?

  type :: t
    type(lock_type), pointer :: P = NULL()
  end type t

  type(t), parameter :: N = t(null())
  type(t) :: V
  type(lock_type), target :: L

1 nullify ( v%p )

2 v%p => l

3 v = n

ANSWER:

Constraint C1303 prohibits a variable of type LOCK_TYPE from appearing
in a variable definition context, with a few exceptions that do not
include statements 1 and 2.  Subclause 16.6.7 specifies that the
appearance of a variable as a <pointer-object> in a <nullify-stmt>, or
as a <data- pointer-object> or <proc-pointer-object> in a <pointer-
assignment-stmt>, is a variable association context.  Therefore
statements 1 and 2 do not conform to the Fortran 2008 standard.

The appearance of a <pointer-object> in a <nullify-stmt>, or of a <data-
pointer-object> or <proc-pointer-object> in a <pointer-assignment-stmt>,
are pointer association contexts, and are listed as such in subclause
16.6.8; they ought not to be listed as variable definition contexts in
subclause 16.6.7.

{The above proposition was advocated in 14-139r3, accepted at meeting
204, and incorporated into 14-007r2.  Therefore, statements 1 and 2 will
conform to the next revision of the Fortran standard.  Whether
statements 1 and 2 ought to be included in the present question can be
decided in due course.}

Constraint C1304 prohibits a variable with a subobject of type LOCK_TYPE
from appearing in a variable definition context, with a few exceptions
that do not include statement 3.  Therefore statement 3 does not conform
to the Fortran 2008 standard.

{The proposition that the prohibition should only apply to variables
that have nonpointer subobjects of the type EVENT_TYPE being developed
in TS 18508 was accepted, and incorporated into 14-231/N2027.}

Statements 1-3 are harmless, and ought to be permitted.  Edits are
provided to correct this.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[399:22 C1304] Insert "nonpointer" before "subobject".

{A change parallel to this, concerning EVENT_TYPE, is already
incorporated in 14-231/N2027.}

EDITS already applied in 14-007r2:

[312:33+ C1283(1)+] Insert a list item

  "(1a) in a pointer association context (16.6.8),"

{This is a knock-on effect due to deleting pointer association contexts
from the list of variable definition contexts.  It recovers items (2),
(3) and (12) from 16.6.7p1, which are deleted below.}

[313:1-2 C1283(5)]  Delete "with INTENT(OUT) or INTENT(INOUT)" from item
(6) because it is covered by 16.6.7p1(12).

[456:44-45 16.6.7p1(2-3)] Delete list items (2) and (3) because they are
not variable definition contexts, and do not apply to nonpointer
variables.

[445:11 16.6.7p1(12)] Append "is not a pointer and" after "dummy
argument", because an actual argument pointer corresponding to a dummy
argument pointer is not a variable definition context, and doesn't apply
to nonpointer variables.

TITLE: Is recursive USE within a submodule permitted?
KEYWORDS: SUBMODULE, USE
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider
  Module m1
    Real x
  End Module
  Submodule(m1) subm1
    Use m1
  End Submodule

Q1. The module m1 is referenced from within one of its own
    submodules.  Is this standard-conforming?

Note that the "submodule TR", Technical Report 19767 contains, an
edit with the normative requirement:
  "A submodule shall not reference its ancestor module by use
   association, either directly or indirectly."
along with a note which says
  "It is possible for submodules with different ancestor modules to
   access each other's ancestor modules by use association."
It also contains an edit to insert the direct reference prohibition
as a constraint.

However, none of this text appears in ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010.

The Introduction simply comments that submodules are available, but
not that they have been extended beyond the Technical Report that
created them.

Also, consider

  Module m2
    Real, Private :: a
    Real, Protected :: b
    ...
  End Module
  Submodule(m2) subm2
  Contains
    Subroutine s
      Use m2
      Implicit None
      a = 3
      b = 4
    End Subroutine
  End Submodule

In submodule SUBM2, procedure S references M2 by use association.
Use association does not make "A" accessible.

Q2. Is "A" still accessible by host association?

Also, procedure S attempts to assign a value to B, which is accessed
by use association, but has the PROTECTED attribute.  Normally, this
attribute prevents assignment to variables accessed by use
association.

Q3. Is the assignment to "B" standard-conforming?

DISCUSSION:

The requirement appears in the early drafts of Fortran 2008, up to
08-007r1, then it was modified by paper 08-154r1 creating a UTI
(because the modification was broken), and finally the requirement was
completely removed by paper 09-141.

ANSWER:

A1. No, the example was not intended to be conforming.  Permission for
    a submodule to access its ancestor module by use associated was a
    mistake.  An edit is provided to correct this error.

N2093 reasons for failure: F08/0128

Reinhold Bader
I agree with the answers A1.- A3., except that in A1. "use associated"
should be replaced by "use association".

I disagree with the suggested edit, because it is too broad. Instead, I
suggest the following:

[275:9+] 11.2.3 Submodules,
         "A submodule shall not directly reference its ancestor module
          by use association. If a submodule indirectly references its
          ancestor module by use association, every USE statement in its
          body that causes such a reference shall specify an ONLY option.
          An entity in the <only-list> for that option that is not a
          generic specifier or a renamed operator shall not be specified
          in the submodule's ancestor module. For an entity that is a
          generic specifier or a renamed operator, the referenced
          specific procedure (12.5.5.2) shall not be specified in the
          submodule's ancestor module."

I'm hoping that this not only yields the same answers to the interp, but
also permits compile-time checking of any violations, avoiding the
complaint made by UTI 151 in 09-007. If this turns out to be unfixably
wrong, I'm willing to change my vote to "yes".

The rationale for the above suggestion is as follows:

Imagine that S(A) is a submodule of A (the ancestor) and wants to access
some other module {M} that may be a single module or the beginning of
a use-chain of modules. Prior to the interp, the following dependencies
are permitted, where (u) stands for use and (h) for host association:

     -(u)---->{M}
    /          |
   /          (u)
  /            |
 /             v
S(A) --(h)---> A

With the interp's original edit, the line connecting one (or more) of
the modules in {M} and A causes the program to become non-conforming.
The alternative edit permits the programmer to avoid this with minimal
(if any) overhead.

During the London meeting it was pointed out that the dependency could be
avoided by restructuring the code and moving dependent parts to an
auxiliary module. This is true, but it may involve writing significantly
more code, and often also a submodule of the auxiliary module is needed.
As a result, the global code structure becomes more difficult to
understand.
Furthermore, if A implements "core" concepts that many other modules
might depend on (pushing code to S(A) wouldn't be needed otherwise), it
may well happen that the critical use association M->A gets established
later on in the development process, triggering a potentially large
amount of code restructuring (multiple submodules could be affected in
one fell stroke!). With the alternative edit, the only fallout is that
ONLY clauses must be added in S(A) if they're not already there anyway.

Robert Corbett

Answer A1 states that the example was not intended to be conforming.
Paper 09-141, which is cited in the discussion section, begins

       The prohibition against a submodule accessing or
       referencing its ancestor module by use association
       appears to have been wrong-headed in the first place.
       There appears to be no reason to keep it in any form.

I did not attend the meeting during which paper 09-141 was
approved, but I find it hard to believe that the committee could
have passed that paper without intending to allow such usage.

I see no technical objection to implementing the feature as it is
currently specified.  Paper 09-141 contains remarks to that effect.
The comments Reinhold Bader included in his ballot convinced me
that the feature is useful, and that its removal will put a burden
on users.  If the feature is retained, Q2 and Q3 need answers.
My reading of the Fortran 2008 standard as written is that the
answer to both questions is "yes".

On a minor note, the line

      Note that the "submodule TR", Technical Report 19767 contains, an
      edit

does not conform to the rules of punctuation of American English.
In American English, the comma that terminates an appositive
phrase appears at the end of the phrase, not after the following
verb.  Also, the appearance of quotation marks in that line would
be considered misuse in American English.  It implies that the
term "submodule TR" has an unconventional meaning, which I do
not think is the case here

Erik Kruyt

In the light of F08/0142 the examples are incorrect due to the
augmented C1113. Change the module in the first example to e.g.:
Module m1
  Interface
    Module Subroutine mp1
    End Subroutine
  End Interface
  Real x
End Module

Change the module in the second example to e.g.:
Module m2
  Interface
    Module Subroutine mp2
    End Subroutine
  End Interface
  Real, Private :: a
  Real, Protected :: b
  ...
End Module


Van Snyder

Upon reflection, I prefer an answer very similar to Option 1 in 15-208.
A proposed revision is:

{begin revision}

DISCUSSION:

The prohibition against a submodule accessing its ancestor module by use
association appears in the early drafts of Fortran 2008, up to 08-007r1.
Then it was modified by paper 08-154r1 creating a UTI (because the
modification was broken), and finally the requirement was completely
removed by paper 09-141.

ANSWER:

A1. Yes, the example is conforming.  An edit is supplied to add this
    extension to the Introduction, and to add normative text to clause
    11 to make this completely unambiguous.

A2. Yes, A is still accessible by host association.
    Subclause 16.5.1.4 paragraph 2 states
      "If an entity that is accessed by use association has the same
       nongeneric name as a host entity, the host entity is
       inaccessible by that name."
    This does not apply since A is not accessed by use association
    (because it is PRIVATE and therefore not accessible by use
    association, according to the final sentence of the second paragraph
    of 5.3.2).  Therefore, A can still be accessed by host association.
    An edit is provided to revise the referenced sentence to make it
    clear that the entity is accessible by use association but not host
    association, rather than being completely inaccessible.

A3. No, the assignment to B is not conforming because, according to the
    first sentence of the second paragraph of subclause 16.5.1.4, it is
    accessed by use association, and therefore violates constraint C551
    which states
      "A nonpointer object that has the PROTECTED attribute and is
       accessed by use association shall not appear in a variable
       definition context..."
    An edit is provided to add an explanation of this.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[xv] Introduction, p2, first bullet,
  After "Submodules provide ... for modules."
  Insert new sentence
    "A submodule can reference its ancestor module by use
     association."

[100:12] Second paragraph of 5.3.15 PROTECTED attribute, insert this
  text immediately after the word "descendants" (i.e. before the comma)
    "where it is accessed by host association".

[272:23] First paragraph of 11.2.2 The USE statement and use
  association, after
    "A module shall not reference itself, either directly or
     indirectly."
  Append to paragraph
    "A submodule is permitted to reference its ancestor module by
     use association.  "

[273:2+4] Same subclause, NOTE 11.7, append
  "If a submodule accesses a PROTECTED entity from its ancestor module
   by use association, use of that entity is constrained by the
   PROTECTED attribute (5.3.15).".

[443:36-37] Replace the first sentence of the second paragraph of
16.5.1.4 Host Association:

  "If an entity that is accessed by use association has the same
   nongeneric name as a host entity, the host entity is not accessed by
   host association by that name."

{end revision}

The questions are simplified and combined.

I vacillated whether to change the edit for [100:12], viz.
  "where it is accessed by host association"
to
  "where it is not accessed by use association"
to try to make it clearer that construct association is not involved.
Ultimately, I did not change it, because both versions might be
perversely interpreted in that context.  Perhaps some work is needed
here.

The edit for NOTE 11.7 is revised simply to draw attention to 5.3.15 to
refer to it by number instead of repeating material therein.

An edit is provided for [443:36-37] to revise the first sentence of the
second paragraph of 16.5.1.4p2, to make it clear that the entity B is
still accessible, albeit by use association:

        "If an entity that is accessed by use association has the same
        nongeneric name as a host entity, the host entity is not
        accessed by host association by that name."

("... the host entity is inaccessible by that name" could be perversely
interpreted to mean the entity is entirely inaccessible by that name,
i.e., neither by host nor use association.  The problem is the word
"entity.")

This edit would also clarify the situation wherein a host scoping unit
and an internal scoping unit also access the same entity by the same
name by use association (no submodules involved).  I hope this doesn't
need another interp, something like

  module M1
    real, public :: X = 66
  end module M1

  module M2
    use M1, only: X
  contains
    subroutine S1
      use M1, only: X
      implicit NONE
      X = 42
    end subroutine S1
    subroutine S2
      use M1, only: X
      X = 42
    end subroutine S2
    subroutine S3
      call S2
      print *, X
    end subroutine S3
  end module M2

  program P
    use M2, only: S3
    call S3
  end program P

Is the assignment to X in S1 conforming?  Assuming the program conforms,
what is printed by the PRINT statement in subroutine S3, i.e., is the
assignment to X in S2 an assignment to the entity in M1, or is X a local
entity in S2?  According to 16.5.1.4p2, "If an entity that is accessed
by use association has the same nongeneric name as a host entity, the
host entity is inaccessible by that name."  This could be interpreted to
mean that the entity X is not accessible in S1 or S2, neither by use
association nor by host association.

NUMBER: F08/0146
TITLE: Does intrinsic assignment copy inherited components twice?
KEYWORDS: Intrinsic assignment, Type extension
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider

  Type base
    Integer a
  End Type
  Type,Extends(base) :: ext
    Real b
  End Type
  ...
  Type(ext) x,y
  ...
  x = y

According to 7.2.1.2 Intrinsic assignment statement, p13,

  "An intrinsic assignment where the variable is of derived type is
   performed as if each component of the variable were assigned from
   the corresponding component of <expr>"

This would seem to indicate that the above assignment "x = y" is
interpreted as the following (in unspecified order):

  x%a = y%a
  x%b = y%b
  x%base = y%base

and the assignment to x%base is treated as if it were

  x%base%a = y%base%a

thus assigning to x%a twice, which does not seem to make sense.  If a
type is extended more than once, there can be a plethora of ancestor
components inheritance-associated with a component, resulting in that
component being assigned many times.

Q1. Are these per-component assignment semantics intended to apply to
    ancestor components (and thus produce multiple assignments for
    inherited components).

It is particularly problematic if the components have type-bound
defined assignment, for example consider the program

  Module damod
    Type datype
    Contains
      Procedure asgnda
      Generic :: Assignment(=) => asgnda
    End Type
  Contains
    Subroutine asgnda(a,b)
      Class(datype),Intent(Out) :: a
      Class(datype),Intent(In) :: b
      Print *,'Hello asgnda'
    End Subroutine
  End Module
  Module types
    Use damod
    Type base
      Type(datype) c
    End Type
    Type,Extends(base) :: ext
    End Type
  End Module
  Program test
    Use types
    Type(ext) :: x = ext(datype()), y
    y = x
  End Program

Q2. Does this program print "Hello asgnda" once or twice?

ANSWER:

A1. This sentence was not intended to apply to ancestor components; an
    edit is supplied to correct this oversight.

A2. The program should print "Hello asgnda" only once.

[I] expect defind assignment to work like finalization on the parent
of an extended type [15-007r2 4.5.6.2 78:19] - if the parent has
defined assignment, it is called on the parent and not on its components.

From: Tom Clune
Sent: Friday, October 16, 2015 9:41 AM

Attached below is a motivating example of my objection to the interp
we discussed on Tuesday. (Paper 218 I think.)

I also have a few additional arguments to bolster my case:

1) If I understand correctly, the semantics of finalization work on
   the base object, not on the components of the base object.  In
   15-007r2.pdf  4.5.6.2 The finalization process (78:19), we have:  

    "If the entity is of extended type and the parent type is
     finalizable, the parent component is finalized."

   The proposed interp seems to run contrary to this treatment of the
   base as a coherent entity.

2) Not that it really matters, but C++ implicit copy/assignment semantics
   also use the copy/assignment operator for the base object, not its
   components.

3) Just to reiterate my point on Tuesday.   The proposed interp in 218
   adds considerable burden to implementors of type extensions.   If a
   base type overrides default assignment, then the type extension
   almost certainly must as well, or risk ruining some invariant property
   that the base otherwise preserves.  Further, this burden propagates
   down the inheritance hierarchy.  Perhaps on some occasions, the
   implementor may find that default assignment is actually ok, but it
   would require looking "inside" the base type implementation.  (And I
   cannot construct a plausible motivating example of this situation,
   though I've also not tried very hard.)

! The following is an example of how many users intuitively expect
! instrinsic assignment of an extended type when the ancestor type
! has a derived assignment.  

! Here, we desire _deep_ copy semantics for type base, which happens to
! use POINTER components.  In this instance, an allocatable component
! could fix the issue, but consider the case of a base type which
! implements a binary tree, and pointer components were thus much harder
! to avoid.


module the_classes

   type :: base
      integer, pointer :: ptr => null()
   contains
      procedure :: equals
      generic :: assignment(=) => equals
   end type base

   ! We now extend the base class in a relatively trivial manner.
   ! There needs to be at least one new component or the casual
   ! observer might think that the assignment defined below
   ! could just use CLASS for the RHS argument and allow inheritance
   ! to do the "right thing" (TM).  Often we would like the new components
   ! defined in the extension to be copied as well, and that
   ! approach becomes inadequate.
   type, extends(base) :: child
      character(len=:), allocatable :: name
   end type child

contains

   subroutine equals(a, b)
      class (base), intent(out) :: a
      type (base), intent(in) :: b

      allocate(a%ptr)
      a%ptr = b%ptr
      
   end subroutine equals

end module the_classes


program main
   use the_classes
   implicit none

   type (child)  :: c1, c2

   allocate(c1%ptr)
   c1%ptr = 1
   c1%name = 'Alice'

   c2 = c1
   ! Because we want "deep copy" semantics, we want to be able to change
   ! c1%ptr without impacting c2

   c1%ptr = 2

   print*,'Results:'
   print '(10x,a10,1x,i1)', c2%name, c2%ptr
   print '(a9,1x,a10,1x,i1)', 'Expected: ','Alice',1

NUMBER: F08/0149
TITLE: ID= specifier and other specifiers
KEYWORDS: ID= specifier, other specifiers
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

QUESTIONS:

Consider the following program:

program P
  integer :: I
  integer :: J(2)
  namelist /in/ I
  open ( 10, file='F', form='formatted', status='old', &
       & asynchronous='yes' )
1 read ( 10, '(i0)', asynchronous='no', iostat=i ) j(1)
2 read ( 10, '(i0)', asynchronous='yes', id=i )
3 read ( 10, in, asynchronous='yes', id=i )
4 read ( 10, in, asynchronous='yes', id=j(i) )

end program P

Subclause 9.12, paragraph 7, prohibits the variable specified in an
IOSTAT=, IOMSG=, or SIZE= specifier from being associated with any
entity in a <namelist-group-object-list>.  Subclause 9.12, paragraph
7, prohibits a subscript value from being affected by data transfer.
Both paragraphs are silent concerning the ID= specifier.

Which of statements labeled 1-4 permitted?

ANSWER:

Statements 1 and 2 were intended to be permitted.  IOSTAT= and ID=
variables should be allowed to be in a namelist group as long as it is
not the NML= specifier used by the I/O statement in which they appear.

Statements 3 and 4 were not intended to be permitted.  The variable
specified by ID= cannot be associated with the same entities as the
variable specified by IOSTAT=.

Edits are provided to correct these defects.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[243:9 9.12p7] Before "IOSTAT=" insert "ID=,". ok

[243:10 9.12p7] After "<namelist-group-object-list>" insert "of the
<namelist-group-name> in that statement".

[243:12 9.12p8]  Before "IOSTAT=" insert "ID=,".
