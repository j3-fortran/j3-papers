1. Edits
--------

{11.1.3.3 Other attributes of associate names}

[183:20 11.1.3.3p5] Replace "or" with "nor"

current: "neither the associate name or any subobject thereof"

proposed: "neither the associate name nor any subobject thereof"

{to correspond to "neither"}

+++

{11.1.4 BLOCK construct}

[184:9-10 R1109] Delete "<specification-construct>"

current: "[[ <declaration-construct> ] ... <specification-construct> ]"

proposed: "[[ <declaration-construct> ] ... ]"

{because it's included in <declaration-construct>}.

+++

{11.1.10.1 Purpose and form of the SELECT RANK construct}

[199:12 C1150] Replace "maximum rank supported by the processor"
with "fifteen minus the corank"

current: "A <scalar-int-constant-expr> in a <select-rank-case-stmt>
shall be nonnegative and less than or equal to the maximum rank
supported by the processor."

proposed: "A <scalar-int-constant-expr> in a <select-rank-case-stmt>
shall be nonnegative and less than or equal to 15 minus the corank."

{because we don't want constraints to bless
or encourage the use of extensions}

+++

{11.6.2 Segments}

[206:37-38 11.6.2p3(2)] Replace "referenced or defined"
with "referenced, defined, or have its association
or allocation status queried,".

current: "that subobject shall not be referenced or defined
in a segment on another image unless the segments are ordered"

proposed: "that subobject shall not be referenced, defined,
or have its association or allocation status queried,
in a segment on another image unless the segments are ordered"

{cover all cases}

+++

{A.2 Processor Dependencies}

[535:1+ Annex A] Insert a list item:

"  o the value assigned to a STAT= specifier in an image control
     statement if an error other than a stopped image or failed image
     occurs (11.6.11);"

{note in PD list}

2. Optional edit
----------------

[195:19 11.1.8.2p1] Delete "At most ... is executed" because it's
already said in 11.1.8.1p1.
>no - keep since introduces the rest of p1

3. Questions without edits
--------------------------

{JoR did not pursue these}

[185-186 11.1.5] If a CHANGE TEAM construct is executed while a
construct is executing, and that construct has a <selector> that is a
coindexed object, does the CHANGE TEAM construct affect the image index
of the association?  I think not, because it doesn't affect the image
index of an actual argument (or at least I hope it doesn't).  A note
might be helpful to stave off a future interp request.  Something like
"Execution of a CHANGE TEAM statement does not affect associations of
coindexed actual arguments to dummy arguments of procedures that have
not completed execution when the CHANGE TEAM statement is executed, or
associations established by constructs that have not completed execution
when the CHANGE TEAM statement is executed." Or this could be said in
11.1.3.3.  Something like "If the <selector> is a coindexed object, the
image to which it refers is not affected by executing a CHANGE TEAM
statement while the construct is executing," and something like that
somewhere in 15.5.2.3.

[207 NOTE 11.34] Should variables that are referenced or defined by
calls to atomic subroutines have the VOLATILE attribute? Otherwise, how
does the processor know that some other image does not have its value in
a cache?  It probably isn't enough to specify explicitly that it has the
attribute implicitly because an ordinary reference to it might appear in
a different scoping unit from its use in a reference to an atomic
subroutine.  Of should every reference to an atomic subroutine be
preceded and followed by SYNC MEMORY (which seems like a rather large
hammer)?  If they need to have the VOLATILE attribute, its description
should be changed to encompass more than "means other than Fortran."

[210:17 R1169] Why doesn't SYNC TEAM allow an integer to specify the
team, as is allowed in an <image-selector>?

[213 11.6.10] What happens if an image that other images consider to
have failed actually hasn't, doesn't realize they believe it's failed,
and locks a lock variable?

[214-215 11.6.11] Are failed or stopped images error conditions, or
simply information made available using the <stat-variable>?  This
affects whether an image control statement without a STAT= specifier
causes error termination if another image has failed, and the wording of
"if an error other than a stopped image or failed image...."

4. Edits JoR declined
---------------------

[186:2 11.1.5.2p2] Replace first "the" with "its".

{11.1.5.1 Purpose and form of the CHANGE TEAM construct}

[186:11] delete "original"

[186:24,28 11.1.5.2p6,7] Replace "original team"
with "parent team" twice.

{fix that "original" is ambiguous: initial vs. parent}

{11.1.5.2 Execution of a CHANGE TEAM construct}

[187:7 C1120] C1120 should be a constraint on R1116, not a general
constraint.  Insert "(R1116)" before "A branch".

{clarify scope of constraint}

[190:1 11.1.2.7.1p1(1)] Delete "with the same kind type parameter as the
<do-variable>" because the same thing is said two lines below at
[190:3].
>no - m1, m2, m3 are executionmethod, expr1,2,3 are in the syntax

[190:21 11.1.7.4.2p1(1)] Delete "with the same kind type parameter as
the <do-variable>" because the same thing is said two lines below at
[190:23].
>no

[193:11 11.1.7.5p6]  Append a sentence "Each input/output operation is
performed completely without interference from another input/output
operation on the same unit in a different iteration." {This could be a
note if this is already specified somewhere in Clause 12 -- but it needs
to be said here in proximity to the prohibition against ADVANCE.  If the
effect of a critical section within a concurrent construct were to
prohibit an iteration from entering it if another one is executing it,
we could simply say "as if in a critical section."}
>no - [262 12.12p2] says can't start an I/O on an external unit where
>another I/O os already happening

[204:20 11.3p1] After "statement" insert "that is not an <end-do>
statement" {because it has an effect there}.
>no - <end-do> is syntax, does not affect execution

[206:28 11.6.2p2] Replace "may take place"
with "may precede, succeed, or take place".

Insert a comma after "on another image".

[207:0+10-11 NOTE 11.33] After "provided" insert "that a reference
potential reference to, or definition or potential definition of, a
variable that is also referenced or defined in a call to".  Replace "are
not involved" with "is not moved across that call".  {This covers
nonlocal variables that might be referenced or defined during procedure
references.}
>no - keep it simply

[211:5+2 NOTE 11.42] After "synchronizes" insert "an image with the
images of".
>not necessary - current wording is sufficient

>>
>[211:24- 11.6.8p2-] insert

"The <event-variable> shall not depend on the value of the
<stat-variable> or <errmsg-variable>."
>>

>>>no! add to [214p1]
