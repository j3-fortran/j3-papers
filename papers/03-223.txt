          Typos and suggestions for small changes in J3/03-007

[12:27-29] The second sentence of 2.2.3.2 is a misleading half truth.
WG5 recommends that J3 delete it, or make it sufficiently imprecise that
it does not exclude the cases of host association, recursion, procedure
pointers, dummy procedures, type-bound procedures including finalizers,
generic identifiers including UDDTIO, and means other than Fortran.

[228:41]  "right-justified" -> "right justified"

[234:27]  "left-justified" -> "left justified"

[397:13]  "nonkind" -> "length"
          (Only occurrence in document of "nonkind")

[446:5]   "centeroid" -> "centroid"


[454:13] WG5 recommends that J3 review the style of the example in C.2.3.
