NUMBER: TBD
TITLE: Are lower bounds of assumed-shape arrays assumed?
KEYWORDS: LBOUND, assumed-shape array, initialization expression
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Does the following program conform to the 2003 Fortran standard?

  subroutine S ( A )
    integer :: A(:,3:)
    integer, parameter :: R = size(lbound(A))
  end subroutine S

Processors disagree.  If the lower bounds of an assumed-shape array are
assumed, LBOUND(A) is not an initialization expression according to item
(8)(b)(i) in subclause 7.1.7.  If the lower bounds of an assumed-shape
array are not assumed, LBOUND(A) is an initialization expression in this
case, but might be a specification expression in other cases.

ANSWER:

This program conforms to the 2003 Fortran standard.  The lower bounds of
an assumed-shape array are not assumed.  If a lower bound is not
specified, it has the value 1 -- see the final sentence of the final
paragraph of subclause 5.1.2.5.2.  If a lower bound is specified, it
must be specified either by an initialization expression or a
specification expression.  In the example in the question, the lower
bound of the first dimension is omitted, and therefore has the value 1,
while the lower bound of the second dimension is given by an
initialization expression.  Therefore, the reference to LBOUND is an
initialization expression, and the reference to SIZE is therefore an
initialization expression.

EDITS:

Before the last sentence of the final paragraph of 5.1.2.5.2, insert a
sentence: "The lower bounds of an assumed-shape array are not assumed."

or

Insert a note after the final paragraph of 5.1.2.5.2:

"The lower bounds of an assumed-shape array are not assumed."

or

None.
