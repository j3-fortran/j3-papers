Subgroup recommends edits from paper N1544 by Richard Maine
be accepted with modifications noted below.


This paper has edits to correct some typos and editorial trivia
in 03-007.  All page and line references are to 03-007.

I.  Typos and errors

Subgroup added one edit.

Thanks to Aleksander Donev, Dick Hendrickson, Bill Long, Van Snyder,
Craig Dedo, and James Giles for pointing out most of these; for the
most part all I [Richard] did was collect them.

  [44:19] "accessibile" -> "accessible"

  [44:23] "USE" -> "use"

  [47:Note 4.24 2nd line] "to to" -> "to"

  [47:16] "sitype-param-decl" -> "<type-param-decl>"

  [55:10] "<interace>" -> "<interface>"

  [59:Note 4.51]  Reformat the example as

     TYPE, ABSTRACT :: FILE_HANDLE
     CONTAINS
        PROCEDURE(OPEN_FILE), DEFERRED, PASS(HANDLE) :: OPEN
        ...
     END TYPE

  [62:15]  !derived-type-spec? -> <derived-type-spec>

  [69:23] "4.5.3" -> "4.5.6"  {I thought some other paper was going
           to fix this, but I don't see it anywhere.}

  [74:24] "declaration-type-spec" -> "<declaration-type-spec>"

  [164:23] "paraqmeter" -> "parameter"

  [164:16,17,21] Use "\si{type-spec}" instead of "\sinr{type-spec}"
  in the LaTeX source, which won't cause any obvious difference here,
  but will eliminate the duplicate entry for <type-spec> in the index.

  [268:Note 12.15] "C_LOC" -> "C_FUNLOC" (twice)

  [299:29] "allocatiom" -> "allocation"

  [308:8] "=\pi" -> "-\pi"  (where \pi means the math symbol).

  [327:3,10] "and" -> "an" (twice)

  [335:26] "upside-down !" -> "<"

  [337:1] "<" -> "<=" (like in MAXLOC)
  {That's a less-than-or-equals sign, \leq in LaTeX-speak}.

  [340:Note 13.15 2nd line] "transfering" -> "transferring"

  [357:8] Delete 1 of the 2 minus signs.

  [357:8] "86339" -> "1573039"

  [418:6] Delete spurious blank after "unit".

  [434:37] Alphabetize "parent type" correctly; move to (435:2+]

  [444:37] "Data extension" -> "Type extension"
  {The term "data extension" is used nowhere else}

  Subgroup added this edit:
  [445:9] Change "of" to "declared in".

  [445:36] Indent this line like the REAL declarations earlier.

  [446:7] Delete "! Not shown here"
  {Lines 12-16 do appear to show it.  If the "here" is supposed to
  exclude those lines, that is unobvious and misleading.}

  [449:12] The wrong style of dash was typeset, but instead of
  just changing the dash, a better edit is "-so" -> ";".

II. Editorial suggestions

A. Nondelimited/undelimited

  Subgroup accepts "undelimited".

  Section 10 has 3 cases of "nondelimited" and 1 of "undelimited".
  I agree with Dick that "undelimited" sounds better, so I propose
  changing "[a] nondelimited" to "[an] undelimited" at [240:21],
  [241:6], [243:3], and [248:4].  Alternatively, we could change
  "undelimited" to "nondelimited" at [246:Note 10.35 3rd line].
  Don't do both edits.  (If this paper passes without directions
  to the contrary, do the 4 changes instead of the alternative one.)

B. Since

  Subgroup accepts as is.

  The word "since" is best reserved for contexts where it refers to
  time.  Some of the uses in the draft are appropriate, but others
  are not.  In some cases, it is potentially confusing because time
  is involved in the sentence, but that isn't what the "since" is
  referring to.

  "since" -> "because" (retaining capitalization) at

    [8:34], [12:Note 2.2], [45:Note 4.21 line 6] [49:Note 4.27],
    [277:Note 12.31], [347:21], [368:20],
    [414:Note 16.10 line 19], [440:38], [465:25]

  "since" -> "in that" at [441:7]
  (Both "since" and "because" seem wrong here).

C. Redundancy in constraint wording.

  Subgroup modified two edits.

  Several of the constraints have redundancies like "(R612) In a
  <data-ref>...", where R612 is the definition of <data-ref>.  The
  R612 part *MEANS* "In a <data-ref>", so this is completely
  redundant.  We don't consistently have this redundancy.  Nor do
  I think these are special cases that merit the redundancy for
  emphasis.  I think these are just holdovers from when the (R612)
  syntax was added; that addition was done en mass, without any
  wording changes.  The following may not be all the cases, but
  since we are already inconsistent, so I don't consider the
  likelihood that this misses some to be a reason not to do it
  (though if more are noticed, fixing them would also be ok).

  Delete "In a <data-ref>," and capitalize the next word at
  [105:3] (C609), [105:4] (C610), and [105:13] (C614).

  Delete "In a <structure-component>," and capitalize the next
  word at [105:24] (C615),

  Delete "In an <array-element>," and capitalize the next word at
  [107:11] (C617).

  Delete "In an <array-section>," and capitalize the next word at
  [107:14] (C618).

  The following cases have slightly different form and thus need
  a slight additional wording change determined by subgroup.

  [105:9] (C613)  "In a <part-ref> containing a <section-subscript-list>" ->
	"If a <section-subscript-list> appears"

  [107:17] (C619) "In an <array-section> with a <substring-range>" ->
	"If a <substring-range> appears"

D. Misleading bnf term <binding>

  Subgroup accepts as is.

  N1524 points out that the bnf term <binding> causes confusion
  because we use the Engish word "binding" to mean something
  different.  For example, the use of "binding" at [56:10] does
  not mean the bnf <binding> defined 3 lines earlier, but
  instead means a <specific-binding>, <generic-binding>, or
  <final-binding>, as defined in R444.  Although those three
  things are kinds of bindings, they are not kinds of <bindings>;
  instead a <binding> is a syntactic part of a <specific-binding>.
  This is horribly confused.

  I originally suggested using a different bnf term (possibly
  <type-bound-proc> would do), but on further study, we don't
  appear to need a bnf term for this at all.  I speculate that
  the existing bnf term might be a remnant of some earlier
  syntax.  In any case, it trivially factors out of the current
  syntax without loosing anything except the confusion.

    [56:7] (R448) Delete the bnf definition of <binding>.

    [55:8,9,10,11(twice)] Change all other occurances of <binding>
    to <procedure-name>.  (Yes, I verified with grep that these 5
    are the only occurances).

    [56:8-9] Move C462 to [55:10+], renumbering the constraints
    and changing its (R448) reference to (R445).

III.More significant error

  Subgroup recommends that this TECHNICAL CHANGE be done,
  and changed "atribute" to "attribute" in the edit for [98:20].

 This possibly should be in a separate paper, as it goes beyond
  the typographical or editorial level, but I hated to write yet
  another separate paper.  Although this has technical content
  in changing what is legal, this *HAS* to have been an
  unintentional oversight...doesn't it?  Did we really want to
  disallow interoperable derived types in COMMON?  Even in
  COMMON with the BIND(C) attribute?  I'm assuming that someone
  just thought that BIND(C) was a specific form of sequence
  type.  (Although I think that would be a fine way to define
  them, we didn't do so); or perhaps this was overlooked
  completely.  As is, when combined with C561, this disallows
  all derived types in BIND(C) COMMON blocks.

  I understand why C597 disallows variables with the BIND
  attribute, but variables of BIND(C) types, as disallowed
  by C598 are a different matter.

  [98:20] "with" ->
          "or a type with the BIND attribute and it shall have"

  I'm also not sure whether the similar prohibition against
  equivalence of BND(C) types is intentional, but that seems
  less glaringly wrong to me, so I left it alone.
