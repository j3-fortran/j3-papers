Title:                $ and \ Edit Descriptors

Submitted By:    Craig Dedo

Status:            For Consideration

References:

Basic Functionality:
    Fortran should include support for the $ and \ edit descriptors for
the purpose of suppressing end-of-record action.

Rationale:
    Both of these edit descriptors suppress end-of-record information at
the end of a record.  This makes it possible to concatenate two or more
records in one output line or to create prompting.  The $ edit
descriptor is an extension in the CVF, HP, IBM, Lahey, and Sun compilers.

Estimated Impact:
    Minimal.  The algorithms already exist.

Detailed Specification:
    The Fortran standard should implement these edit descriptors as
defined in the above mentioned compilers.  If the processor encounters
either of these edit descriptors in the format specification, the
processor suppresses end-of-record action.
