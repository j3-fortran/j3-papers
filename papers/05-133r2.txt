1) Number:

   TBD

2) Title: 

   DO CONCURRENT Construct

3) Submitted By: 

   J3

4) Status: 

   For Consideration

5) Basic Functionality: 

The DO CONCURRENT construct is a new form of the block DO construct
using loop control syntax like that of FORALL.  It would allow the
iterations of the loop to be executed in any order. Restrictions on
the statements in the loop block are required, but the restrictions
are significantly fewer than for FORALL constructs.

6) Rationale: 

The performance of most modern processors is enhanced, sometimes
significantly, if the number of memory references is reduced. This is
typically accomplished by keeping more of the program data in
processor registers, especially during iterations of a loop. Data from
different loop iterations may be held in independent parts of a
multi-word register (vectorization), in disjoint subsets of a single
register set (loop unrolling), or in the register sets of several
different processors or processor cores of a multi-threaded processor
(parallel execution). Many modern computer systems can already take
advantage of all of these optimization methods, and trends in computer
system architecture suggest these optimization techniques will be
even more important in the future.  The DO CONCURRENT construct is
designed to allow compilers to better use these optimizations.

These optimizations rely on the values contained in registers being
the same as the associated values in memory when the corresponding
variables are referenced during execution of the construct. This is
the case if there is no associated memory value during execution of
the construct, or if the nature of cross iteration data dependencies
is properly limited.

Compared to the FORALL construct, the DO CONCURRENT construct allows a
much larger class of statements within the block, including calls to
pure subroutines and some branches. DO CONCURRENT constructs also
avoid the iteration space temporaries that FORALL requires in cases
where the compiler cannot prove there are no cross iteration
dependencies. If there really are dependencies, FORALL may be the
better option, but in a large number of cases, there are no actual
dependencies and DO CONCURRENT will provide much better performance.

The DO CONCURRENT construct provides a way for the programmer to
specify that the aggressive optimizations described above are
allowed. It is cleaner and more portable than the current method of
using directives that have difference spellings and meanings among
vendors.

7) Estimated Impact: 

Specifications of the new syntax and restrictions on the statements in
the construct block are needed in section 8.1.6. Additions in section
16 to subsections on variable definition and undefinition, and pointer
association status are also needed. Implementation in compilers should
be simple, as many compilers already support similar features through
directives. At a minimum, a compiler could convert the construct to a
set of ordinary DO loops, possibly with an added IF test. The original
proposal in 04-243 was rated as an impact of 5 on the JKR scale. This
proposal is somewhat simpler than the original because it leverages
the existing block DO construct.

8) Detailed Specification: 

The syntax for DO CONCURRENT specifies a new <loop-control> for the
existing <block-do-construct> that uses the FORALL header syntax:

   [,] CONCURRENT <forall-header>

The scope rules for an <index-name> in the <forall-header> are the
same as in a FORALL construct (7.4.4.1).

The values of the index variables for the iterations of the construct
are determined by the rules for the index variables of the FORALL
construct (7.4.4.2.1 and 7.4.4.2.2). The number of distinct index
value tuples is the iteration count for the construct. The order in
which the iterations are executed is indeterminant.

A statement in the loop range shall not cause a branch out of the loop
range. The loop range shall not contain an EXIT statement that would
cause the DO CONCURRENT construct to terminate.

A variable that is referenced in an iteration of a DO CONCURRENT
construct shall either be previously defined during that iteration, or
shall not be defined during any other iteration. A variable that is
defined in more than one iteration becomes undefined when execution of
the construct completes.

A pointer that is referenced in an iteration of a DO CONCURRENT
construct either shall be previously pointer associated during that
iteration, or shall not become pointer associated in the loop range. A
pointer that is pointer associated in more than one iteration has a
processor dependent association status when the execution of the
construct completes.

An allocatable object that is allocated in more than one iteration of
a DO CONCURRENT construct shall be subsequently deallocated during the
same iteration in which it was allocated.  An object that is allocated
or deallocated in only one iteration of a concurrent shall not be
deallocated, allocated, referenced, or defined in a different iteration.

An input/output statement in a DO CONCURRENT construct shall not write
data to a file record or position in one iteration and read from the
same record or position in a different iteration.

Procedures referenced in the loop range of a DO CONCURRENT construct
shall be PURE. If the IEEE_EXCEPTIONS intrinsic module is accessible,
references to the IEEE_GET_FLAG, IEEE_SET_HALTING_MODE, and
IEEE_GET_HALTING_MODE subroutines shall not appear in the loop range.

Note: The restrictions on referencing variables defined in an
iteration apply to any procedure invoked by the loop.

Note 12.44 in section 12.6 (Pure procedures) should be updated to
include the DO CONCURRENT construct as well as the FORALL construct.
