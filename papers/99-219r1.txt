1. Introduction

Richard Maine claims that additional restrictions are required on what can be
done with non-present optional pointer arguments.  I concur.

However, he includes
  "pointer dereferenced (which might not always constitute a reference)".
This is already covered by items (1) and (6).

2. Edits

[279:12-17] Delete.
{Delete the J3 note.}

[279:33] After "not be" insert
         "allocated, deallocated, nullified, pointer-assigned, or".
{Cover the pointer cases}.

[279:35+] Add additional item to list:
          "(7) If it is allocatable, it shall not be allocated, deallocated,
               or supplied as an actual argument corresponding to a
               non-allocatable dummy argument other than as the argument of the
	       PRESENT intrinsic function."
