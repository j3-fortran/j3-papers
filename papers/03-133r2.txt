Subject: Cater for more C types
Reference: 02-007r3

One of the work items in N1510 calls for catering
for the C types int8_t, int16_t, int32_t, int64_t
and intptr_t.  Discussion on the floor of 03-133r1
resulted in the request for addition of wchar_t.
According to the C Standard, wchar_t is an integer
type, so we make it interoperate with INTEGER, not
CHARACTER.

This paper attempts to do so.

This time, I copied and pasted from 02-307r1 and 02-319r2,
(well, actually, 307 since 319 says "see 307" :-)
thereby increasing the odds of getting it right.

EDITS:

[381:20]  After "C_SIGNED_CHAR," insert "C_WCHAR_T,"; after "C_SIZE_T,"
          insert "C_INT8_T, C_INT16_T, C_INT32_T, C_INT64_T,".
[381:22]  Remove "and".
[381:22]  After "C_INTMAX_T", insert ", and C_INTPTR_T".
[381:23]  After "-1", insert "if the companion C processor
  defines the corresponding C type and there is no
  interoperating Fortran processor kind or -2 if the
  C processor does not define the corresponding C type".

[385:17+] Add the following row to Table 15.2 below the row
  for C_SIGNED_CHAR:
  (Column 1)   (Column 2)   (Column 3)
  INTEGER      C_WCHAR_T    wchar_t

[385:17+] Add the following rows to Table 15.2 below the row

  INTEGER      C_INT16_T    int16_t
  INTEGER      C_INT32_T    int32_t
  INTEGER      C_INT64_T    int64_t

[385:17+] Add the following row to Table 15.2 below the row
