This is a whack at interp F03/0075.  The outcome proposed here is the
same as in the original submission.  The change proposed here is
different from the change originally proposed.  The change originally
proposed would not work because it was in constraint, which would have
required the Fortran processor to parse and understand the C function
with which the reference is expected to interoperate.

NUMBER: F03/0075
TITLE: C interop of derived types with array components
KEYWORDS: Interoperability, dummy procedures
DEFECT TYPE: ERRATUM
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Is the following C struct:

typedef struct
{
   float x[5];
} array

interoperable with this Fortran type:

type, bind(c) :: array
   real(c_float) :: x(3)
end type

ANSWER:

No. According to the words in 15.2.3, the answer is yes, since only
interoperability of the types of the C and Fortran components is
required.  This is, however, an oversight.  An edit is provided to
correct this.

EDITS:

In the first sentence of the first paragraph after NOTE 15.12 in
subclause 15.2.3 [04-007:398:11-12], replace "have types and type
parameters that are interoperable with the types of the corresponding
components of the struct type" with "would interoperate with
corresponding components of the C struct type as described in 15.2.4 and
15.2.5 if the components were variables".
