NUMBER: F18/028
TITLE: Specification inquiry
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:
      implicit type (t) (a-z)
      integer,parameter :: n = storage_size(x)
      type t
        character(len=n) :: s
      end type t
      print *, n
      end

Two compilers tested issue a compile time error message while a third
compiler compiled the program and printed "0" when executed.
 
Is the use of storage_size(x) a valid specification expression
in this program? 

DISCUSSION:

In the above program, x is implicitly typed to be type(t). It is used 
in a specification expression requiring knowledge of type(t), prior to 
the specification of type(t). There is no text in the standard to 
prohibit this usage. 

The rules for specification expressions require the type, type 
parameters, array bounds, and cobounds of a variable to be known 
via prior specification, or use or host association when the variable
is used in a specification expression. If an element of an array whose 
value is used in a specification expression, the array must be fully
specified in prior declarations. 

The intent is that specification expressions which are constant ex-
pressions can be evaluated when seen. 

ANSWER: 

No, the program is not conforming. The use of an implicitly typed var-
iable of derived type in a specification inquiry prior to the spec-
ification of the derived type was overlooked.  An edit is provided 
to correct this oversight.

EDIT to 18-007r1:

[158:4] 10.1.11 Specification expression p6 
  Insert at the end of the paragraph:
    "If a specification inquiry depends on the type of an object of
     derived type, that type shall be previously defined."
{It is only possible for the type of a variable not to be previously
 defined if it is typed by the implicit typing rules, but a pointer
 component can refer a type before its definition.}
