QUESTION:

Consider the program:

      Module m
        Type t1
          Real c
        Contains
          Final :: f10,f11
        End Type
        Type,Extends(t0) :: t2
          Real d
        Contains
          Final :: f20,f21
        End Type
      Contains
        Subroutine f10(x)
          Type(t),Intent(InOut) :: x
          Print *,'f10 called'
        End Subroutine
        Subroutine f11(x)
          Type(t),Intent(InOut) :: x(:)
          Print *,'f11 called'
        End Subroutine
        Subroutine f20(x)
          Type(t),Intent(InOut) :: x
          Print *,'f20 called'
        End Subroutine
        Subroutine f21(x)
          Type(t),Intent(InOut) :: x(:)
          Print *,'f21 called'
        End Subroutine
      End Module
      Program q
        Call sub(1.5,2.5)
      End Program
      Subroutine sub(x,y)
        Use m
        Type(t1),Parameter :: p1 = t1(2.5)
        Type(t2),Parameter :: p2 = t2(3.5,-3.5)
        Call s10(t1(x))
        Call s11([p1])                     ! (a)
        Call s11([t1(x)])                  ! (b)
        Call s11([ [ [ p1,p1 ] ] ])        ! (c)
        Call s20(t2(x,y))
        Call s21([p2])                     ! (d)
        Call s21([t2(y,y)])                ! (e)
        Call s21([t2(t1=p1,y)])            ! (f)
        Call s21([t2(t1=t1(x),y)])         ! (g)
        Call s21([(p2,t2(x,y),i=1,10**7)]) ! (h)
      End Program

The topic is how many times each final procedure is called on return
from each subroutine?

For s10, clearly f10 is called once.

For s11(a), clearly f11 is called once, and f10 is not called.

For s11(b), the standard (4.5.6.3 para 5) seems to indicate that f10
  is called.  That would not make much sense - the value of the
  structure constructor is part of the value of the array constructor,
  so calling f10 would mean that that array element would be finalized
  twice (once by f11, once by f10, in no set order).

For s11(c), the standard standard appears to say that f11 is called
  three times, once for each (nested) array constructor.  Seeing as
  how nesting array constructors is a syntactic thing that makes zero
  difference to the value - the value of [[anything]] is identical in
  every respect to the value of [anything] - this does not seem to
  make sense.

For s20, clearly f20 is called once, and f10 is called afterwards to
  finalize the parent component.

For s21(d), clearly f21 is called once, followed by f11 to finalize the
  parent components.  f20 and f10 are not called.

For s21(e), f21 and f11 are called as in s21(d); the standard implies
  that f20 and then f10 are called, but that does not make sense, the
  same as case s11(b).

For s21(f), the situation seems to be the same as s21(e); the wanted
  f21 and f11, and (unordered) the unwanted f20 and f10.

For s21(g), f21 and f11 are called as in s21(d); the standard implies
  that f10 is called to finalize t1(3) and also that f20 and then f10
  are called to finalize t2(t1=t1(3),4).  This makes even less sense
  than before, since the t1 part of the array constructor element is
  going to be finalized 3 times just because of the syntax we used.

For s21(h), f21 and f11 are called as in s21(d) to finalize the whole
  array constructor value; the standard also implies that f20 and then
  f10 are called on all of the 5000000 even-numbered elements.
  Requiring the processor to keep track of all those elements to be
  finalized on return from s21 seems rather severe.

Furthermore, an object that has been finalized is not permitted to be
referenced or defined.  That makes the multiple finalization
interpretation even more hard to understand.

Philosophically, finalization should finalize objects exactly once.

There seem to be three possibilities here.
(1) The finalizers are called multiple times, but on the separate
    entities created by the constructors.  For example s21(g), that is
    t1(3) is created as object X, when t2(...) is evaluated a new
    separate object Y is created and that value is copied into it, and
    when [...] is evaluated a third object Z is created with the value
    of Y copied into it; afterwards, we effectively have
       call f10(X); call f20(Y); call f21(Z); call f11(Z%t1)
    For s21(h) that burden is going to be extreme because the standard
    says these are "finalized after execution of the innermost
    executable construct containing the reference" (and it is possible
    to detect this in a conforming program); changing that to
    "finalized after the value has been used" would be better if
    slightly vague.
(2) These entities are indeed finalized multiple times, just as the
    standard implies.
(3) Constructors that are merely providing part of the value of a
    bigger constructor are not finalized.
(4) Constructors should never be finalized in themselves, this was
    just a design error that inevitably leads to multiple or
    unwanted finalization.

Which is the correct approach?

ANSWER:
Approach 3.  Finalizing anything more than once, or constructors that
merely provide part of the value of a bigger constructor, was not the
intention.  Edits are provided to correct the mistake.

ALTERNATIVE ANSWER:
Approach 4.  Constructors don't do anything that needs finalization.
Edits are provided to correct the mistake.

EDITS:

{to 10-007}

[76:24,28] In 4.5.6.3 When finalization occurs, paragraphs 5 and 7,
  Before ", the entity created"
  Insert "that is not a <component-data-source> or <ac-value>".

ALTERNATIVE EDITS:

[76:24-25,28-29] Delete paragraphs 5 and 7 of 4.5.6.3
                 (When finalization occurs).
