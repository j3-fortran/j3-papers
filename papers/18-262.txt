Questions
=========

11.1.3.3p5 ([175:18-21] in 18-007r1) says that if a selector is not
definable, neither the associate name nor a subobject of it shall appear
in a variable-definition context.

Should this also prohibit a pointer subobject from appearing in a
pointer association context?

19.6.8 ([517:1-5] in 18-007r1) lists four pointer-association contexts.

Intrinsic and defined assignment to a derived-type object that has a
pointer component is not listed.

Are these pointer-association contexts?

Edits (depending upon answers to the questions)
===============================================

[175:21 11.1.3.3p5 Other attributes of associate names] After "variable
definition context" insert " or a pointer association context".

[517:2+ 19.6.8 Pointer Association Context] Insert a list item after
"... <pointer-assignment-stmt>;":

"  o a <variable> in an <assignment-stmt> if the variable has a pointer
     ultimate component;"
