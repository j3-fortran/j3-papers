This paper is informational.  It is not for vote.

James Demmel and Jason Riedy published an article titled
"A New IEEE 754 Standard for Floating-Point Arithmetic
in an Ever-Changing World" in SIAM News last summer.
Fortran and C were mentioned in the article for having
adopted the new versions of the max and min operations.

The subgroup on floating-point formats for AI continues
its work.  In addition to the four 16-bit formats they
had before, they are now considering shorter formats.

A new study group has been formed to work on correctly
rounded implementations of the elementary functions
using the new features of the new edition of IEEE 754.

The C standards committee is working on integration of
C with the new edition of IEEE 754. The new edition of
C standard is tentatively named C23.
