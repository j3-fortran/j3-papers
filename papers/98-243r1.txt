Subject:     Edits for explicitly typed array constructors

This paper proposes edits for explicitly typed array constructors.
Specs and syntax were approved in paper J3/98-162, with option 1
(intrinsic assignment only for the assignment syntax).

My records do not record whether the primary or alternate syntax of
paper 98-162 was selected.  The edits below implement the alternative
syntax based on discussion with some implementors.  The *ONLY*
diference is inwhether the type-spec is before or after the "(/"
(and if before, the "::" is omitted), so it would be trivial to
change the edits.

Subsequent to the approval of 98-162 specs, it was noticed that
restricting the non-kind type parameters to be specification
expressions made the facility largely useless for some of its
major purposes.  The same issue arose in explicitly typed
allocations.  The edits approved in 98-208r2 lay the background
for solving this issue for both explicitly typed allocation and
explicitly typed array constructors; the restrictions on the kinds
of expressions allowed are moved elsewhere so that they apply
only when they are relevant.  Thus the restrictions don't need
to be in the basic definitions of the array constructor.

These edits are all relative to J3/98-007R3.

In 4.6, array constructors

  [56:17] After "(/" insert "[ <type-spec> :: ]"

  [56:25] "Each" -> "If the <type-spec> is omitted, each"

  [56:25+] Add
     "Constraint: If <type-spec> specifies an intrinsic type,
      then each <ac-value> expression in the <array-constructor>
      shall be of an intrinsic type that is compatable with
      intrinsic assignment to a variable of type <type-spec>
      as specified in table 7.9.

      Constraint: If <type-spec> specifies a derived type, then
      each <ac-value> expression in the <array-constructor> shall
      be of the same derived type and shall have the same kind
      type parameter values.

      [BEGIN J3 NOTE]
        The following requirement is proposed to solve the
        ambiguity questioned in one of the f95 interps.  This
        might be interpreted as invalidating some existing
        f90/f95 programs, but the validity of such programs under
        f90/f95 is not clear.  Different f90/f95 compilers
        exhibit diferent behavior in this area.  The requirement
        is not a constraint because it is not always checkable at
        compile time; this also alows those processors that
        currently allow the code in question to continue doing so
        as an extension.

        If this requirement is added, then it also makes sense to
        make the <ac-value-list> optional, allowing a natural
        syntax for a zero-sized constructor (which does have uses).

          The <type-spec> shall appear if the <array-constructor>
          is of size zero.
      [BEGIN J3 NOTE]

      If <type-spec> is omitted, each <ac-value> expression in
      the <array-constructor> shall have the same type and type
      parameters.  The type and type parameters of the array
      constructor are those of the <ac-value> expressions.

      If <type-spec> appears, it specifies the type and type
      parameters of the array constructor.  Each <ac-value>
      expression in the <array-constructor> shall be compatible
      with intrinsic assignment to a variable of this type and
      type parameters.  Each value is converted to the type
      and type parameters of the <array-constructor> in accordance
      with the rules of intrinsic assignment (7.5.1.4)."
