1. Introduction

This paper contains the formal syntax specification for true enumeration
types.

The Formal Requirements and Formal Specifications papers (19-230 & 19-231)
are essential background reading for this paper.

Although this is a formal syntax paper, the syntax will be defined by prose
and by example, not by BNF. This is to aid comprehension without having to
expand a set of BNF rules in one's head.


2. Formal Syntax

(a) Syntax of an enumeration type definition.

Note: This syntax assumes specification 11.ALTERNATIVE ONE; if some other
      variation of specification 11 is chosen, it may need to be reflected
      here.

    (i) This should look as much like a normal derived type definition
        as possible. A new type attribute keyword, ENUMERATION, determines
        that this is an enumeration type definition and not a structure.

    (ii) Other type attributes are permitted when they make sense; at this
         time that means EXTENDS, PRIVATE, and PUBLIC.

    (iii) The body of the type definition shall be a sequence of ENUMERATOR
          statements. If the type is not an extended type, the sequence
          shall be non-empty. Unlike the ENUM,BIND(C) construct, the
          ENUMERATOR statements are not permitted to specify a value.

    (iv) The initial value may be specified by an INITIAL statement at the
         end of the type definition. COMMENT: This is so that all the
         enumerator definitions are seen before we access any of them.

    (v) An initial value shall be an enumerator denotation; that is,
        either a name, or the alternative syntax that qualifies the
        enumerator name with the type name. The initial value shall
        be of the enumeration type or an ancestor type.

    (vi) The ENUMERATOR statement may have an accessibility attribute
         specified (if in a module specification part). This may also
         appear on an ENUMERATOR statement in an ENUM,BIND(C) construct.

         The default accessibility is the accessibility of the enumeration
         type name itself.

For example,

    TYPE,ENUMERATION,PUBLIC :: my_enum
        ENUMERATOR a,b
        ENUMERATOR c
        INITIAL c
    END TYPE

    TYPE,ENUMERATION,EXTENDS(my_enum),PRIVATE :: my_extra_enums
        ENUMERATOR :: d
        ENUMERATOR,PUBLIC :: e
        ENUMERATOR,PRIVATE :: f
        INITIAL :: a
    END TYPE

ALTERNATIVE SYNTAX:
(a1) Omit the "TYPE," in the initial statement, and
     change TYPE to ENUMERATION in the final statement.
     e.g.
     ENUMERATION,PUBLIC :: my_enum
         ...
     END ENUMERATION

(a2) Instead of the rather long keyword ENUMERATION, reuse our existing
     keyword ENUM. This could be combined with (a0) or (a1), e.g.
        TYPE,ENUM,PUBLIC :: my_enum
     or
        ENUM,PUBLIC :: my_enum

(a3) Instead of an INITIAL statement at the end of the type definition,
     use an INITIAL(value) attribute at the beginning of the
     type definition.

(a4) As we are inside a type definition, we could require the initial value
     to be a simple unqualified enumerator name; this is not ambiguous as
     we are inside the scope of the type definition and so its enumerators
     would block host association.

(a5) We could permit the initial value to be specified by a constant
     expression instead of a name or denotation. This would add complexity
     without functionality.

(a6) We could permit a PRIVATE statement within an enumeration type defn,
     to specify the default accessibility of the enumerators to be PRIVATE.
     This does not seem useful enough to be worth doing.

(b) Syntax for declaring entities of enumeration type:
        TYPE(enumeration-type-name)

- - - - -

(c) Syntax for accessing the first and last values of an enumeration type:
    use the intrinsic functions TINY (the first) and HUGE (the last), i.e.
        TINY(enumeration-type-object)
        HUGE(enumeration-type-object)

ALTERNATIVE SYNTAX:
(c1) Instead of reusing TINY and HUGE, add new generic intrinsic functions
     FIRST and LAST just for enumeration types.

(c2) Have FIRST and LAST as implicitly-created type-bound functions in the
     enumeration type. E.g., given an entity EV of enumeration type,
        EV%FIRST() ! returns the first enumeration value
        EV%LAST()  ! returns the last enumeration value

COMMENT: Would preclude use in constant expressions without some careful
         new wording.

(c3) Have FIRST and LAST as pseudo-parameters in the enumeration type,
     like kind type parameters, e.g.
        EV%FIRST ! is the first enumeration value
        EV%LAST  ! is the last enumeration value

(c4) Have FIRST and LAST be accessible through the type name instead of
     an entity name (contradicts specification 22, but remains in accord
     with the related requirement L). For example,
        MY_ENUM%FIRST
        MY_ENUM%LAST

COMMENT: Depending on the syntax used for qualified enumerator denotation,
         c2, c3, and c4 might preclude using FIRST and LAST as enumerator
         names. c4 uses the type name in a way we have never used a type
         name before.

(d) Syntax for, given an enumeration value, getting the next value or the
    previous value: use new generic intrinsic functions
        NEXT(enumeration-value)
        PREV(enumeration-value)
    If NEXT and PREV are to return an error status instead of "clamping"
    their result to the enumeration range, they should have an optional
    STAT= argument.

    If there is an optional STAT= argument, it follows the usual rules;
    zero for success, positive for error, error termination on error if it
    is absent.

ALTERNATIVE SYNTAX:
(d1) Implicitly-created type-bound functions in the enumeration type, e.g.
        EV%NEXT()
        EV%PREV()
     If the functions don't clamp, there should be an optional STAT=, e.g.
        EV%NEXT( [ STAT= stat-variable ] ) etc.
     A STAT= argument would follow the same rules as above.

COMMENT: The names PRED and SUCC have been suggested instead of NEXT and
         PREV. Although NEXT and PREV are not terribly exciting names, at
         least they wouldn't make the standard "succ"; I suppose
         PREDECESSOR and SUCCESSOR would be acceptable if overly verbose.

- - - - -

(e) Syntax for "qualified denotation", i.e. specifying an enumerator within
    a specific named enumeration type. As the enumerators live inside the
    type, just use the type name followed by the type-access token %
    and the enumerator name, e.g.
        MY_ENUM % HIDDEN_ENUMERATOR_NAME

ALTERNATIVE SYNTAX:
(e1) Use a new token instead of reusing %; e.g.
        MY_ENUM ` HIDDEN_ENUMERATOR_NAME

(e2) Use the type constructor with the inaccessible enumerator name as its
     argument, e.g.
        MY_ENUM ( HIDDEN_ENUMERATOR_NAME )

COMMENT: e2 syntax is ambiguous if MY_ENUM is to be treated as a generic
         function, as we do with derived types since Fortran 2003. Even if
         there is no ambiguity in a particular example, it promulgates
         confusion between local entity names and names inside a type.

(f) Syntax for 21.ALTERNATIVE (the mechanism for turning an integer value
    into an enumeration value is a function).

    The function is generic, pure, and elemental.
    The name of the function is the name of the enumeration type.

    If all the arguments of the function are constant expressions, the
    function reference is a constant expression.

    The argument of the function that supplies the integer value shall be
    VALUE. Any kind of integer is acceptable. There shall be an optional
    STAT= argument, which is defined with a processor-dependent positive
    value if VALUE is out of range, and zero otherwise. If VALUE is out of
    range and there is no STAT= argument, error termination is initiated.

    There shall be no ERRMSG= argument.

    Note that the restriction against having an INTENT(OUT) argument in a
    pure function actually applies only to function subprograms, not to
    intrinsic functions, functions in intrinsic modules or any other such
    automagical entity, so this would not create a pure problem.

    For example,

        MY_ENUM (IVAL)
        MY_ENUM (VALUE=123)
        MY_ENUM ( [ 1,2,3 ] ) ! if elemental.
        MY_ENUM (STAT=ISTAT,VALUE=X)

- - - - -

(g) Syntax for turning an enumeration value into integer: just use the
    intrinsic function INT, e.g.
        INT(enumeration-value)

ALTERNATIVE SYNTAX:
(g1) Provide this using a type-bound procedure, e.g.
        EV%INT()
     COMMENT: This raises namespace and constant-expression issues, but
              seems to have little other to offer than confusion.
