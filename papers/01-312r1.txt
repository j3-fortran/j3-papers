Changes since the original version, numbered the questions and answers.

NUMBER: F90/000164
TITLE: Use of ONLY with multipart definitions
KEYWORDS: ONLY, module, derived type
DEFECT TYPE:
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION: Sections 11.3.1 and 11.3.2, among others, describe how
accessibility of data objects, derived type definitions, etc.  can
be controlled via the ONLY clause of the USE statement and via the 
PUBLIC and PRIVATE accessibility attributes/statements.  But these 
sections do not describe what happens when a definition consists of
multiple parts and only some of the parts have their accessibility
controlled.  Examples include, but are not limited, to the following:

Example 1:
              MODULE MOD
              INTEGER, PARAMETER :: MAX_SIZE = 100
              INTEGER, DIMENSION(MAX_SIZE) :: ARRAY
              END MODULE

              PROGRAM MAIN
              USE MOD, ONLY: ARRAY
              ...
              END PROGRAM

QUESTION 1a) Since the declaration of ARRAY depends on the value of 
             MAX_SIZE, is it valid to only allow access to ARRAY?  

QUESTION 1b) Is the array constructor for ARRAY, for example, accessible
             to the main program?

Example 2:
              MODULE MOD

              TYPE INNER
                INTEGER I
              END TYPE

              TYPE OUTER
                INTEGER K
                TYPE(INNER) COMP
              END TYPE

              END MODULE

              PROGRAM MAIN
                USE MOD, ONLY: OUTER
                ...
              END PROGRAM

The derived type OUTER in module MOD has a component of derived type INNER.
However, when the main program accesses the module, it restricts access to
only derived type OUTER.

QUESTION 2a) Since OUTER depends on the definition of INNER, is it valid
             to only allow access to OUTER? 

QUESTION 2b) If it is not valid, is it only an error if something in the
             main program actually tries to use OUTER? 

QUESTION 2c) Can you write a structure constructor for OUTER in the main
             program?

QUESTION 2d) If it is valid, can component I of substructure COMP be
             referenced?

Example 3:
              MODULE MOD

              TYPE DEF
                INTEGER K
                REAL    R
              END TYPE

              TYPE(DEF) VAR

              END MODULE

              PROGRAM MAIN
                USE MOD, ONLY: VAR
                ...
              END PROGRAM

    In this example, only the variable VAR from the module is accessible; its
    type is not.

QUESTION 3a) Is this (example 3) valid?

QUESTION 3b) If it is valid, can only the structure name VAR be referenced
             or can its components also be referenced? 

QUESTION 3c) If only the structure name VAR can be referenced, what is the
             meaning when the structure name is included in a namelist object 
             list for input and/or output?

Example 4:
              MODULE MOD
              INTEGER, PARAMETER :: MAX_SIZE = 100
              INTEGER, DIMENSION(MAX_SIZE) :: ARRAY
              PRIVATE MAX_SIZE
              END MODULE

              PROGRAM MAIN
              USE MOD
              ...
              END PROGRAM

    Another way to limit access to items in modules is via the PRIVATE
    attribute/statement.

QUESTION 4a) Since the declaration of ARRAY depends on the value of
             MAX_SIZE, is it valid to only allow access to ARRAY?

QUESTION 4b) Is the array constructor for ARRAY, for example, accessible
             to the main program?

ANSWER:

1a) Yes, ARRAY is accessible, including its size (via the SIZE intrinsic),
    even though MAX_SIZE is not accessible.

1b) An array constructor of size 100 may be used in an assignment statement
    for ARRAY.


2a) Yes, it is valid to access only OUTER and declare objects of type
    OUTER.

2b) Not applicable.

2c) Yes, the structure constructor may be used in the main program.
      For example,
              TYPE(OUTER) X,Y
              X%COMP%I = 65
              Y = OUTER(13,X%COMP)

2d) Yes, component I of component COMP may be referenced.

3a) Yes, there is no requirement that a type be accessible for a entity
    of that type to be accessible.

3b) Both VAR and its components may be referenced.

3c) Not applicable.

    These questions were resolved by interpretation 85, which made a 
    clarifying edit to 14.1.2.5.

4a) Yes, it is valid to allow access only to ARRAY.

4b) ARRAY is accessible, including its size (via the SIZE intrinsic),
    so an array constructor of size 100 may be used in an assignment
    statement for ARRAY.

EDIT: None.
