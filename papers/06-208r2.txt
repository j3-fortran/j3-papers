Subject: C_LOC and contiguous arrays

Specification:
____________________

The proposed edits for the CONTIGUOUS attribute (see J3/05-273r2)
introduce the concept of a contiguous array but do not complete the
integration process with C Interop.

In particular, C_LOC should be extended to return the base address of (run-time)
contiguous array pointer or assumed-shape array (edits below).

Edits:

1.
[475:22] In the first list in the description of the argument to
C_LOC (15.2.3.5), replace item (b) with new item:

(b) "A contiguous object that is not a pointer, has the TARGET attribute,
and is not an array of zero size, or"

1.
[475:24] In the first list in the description of the argument to
C_LOC (15.2.3.5), replace item (c) with:

(c) "An associated scalar pointer or an associated array pointer that has the CONTIGUOUS attribute, or"
