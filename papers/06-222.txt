Subject: C13 - UTI 60, 62, 65: KIND arguments
Date:    28-jul-2006

---------------------

Three Unresolved Technical Issues in Clause 13 regard optional KIND
arguments for the intrinsics
BIT_SIZE  (UTI 62, page 359),
BITS_KIND (UTI 60, page 361), and
LEADZ     (UTI 65, page 395).

The basic argument in each case is that the kind type parameter for
the BITS type is of type default integer and, therefore, the result
values of these functions should also be of type default integer.
Result values larger than huge(0) would never occur.

There are two distinct cases.

1) For BIT_SIZE and BITS_KIND the result values are known at compile
   time and the function references are likely replaced by the
   compiler with the appropriate constant. Including a KIND argument
   effectively allows the user to specify a kind type for that
   constant.

   The length type parameter for CHARACTER is also of type default
   integer and the LEN and LEN_TRIM intrinsics have optional KIND
   arguments. Having optional KIND arguments for similar intrinsic
   functions makes the standard more consistent.

2) LEADZ, TRAILZ, POPCNT, and POPPAR actually involve computation. It
   could be important for performance to have a non-default KIND for
   the result. For example, the computation might be more efficient if
   done with 64-bit hardware instructions, producing a 64-bit result,
   even if the default integer is 32 bits. Avoiding the final
   conversion of the result to a 32-bit value aids performance.  For
   code portability the supplied KIND argument could be a named
   constant that is defined as appropriate for ports of the program to
   specific hardware platforms.  To write optimal code it is important
   for users to have this capability.

Therefore, it is preferred to leave the optional KIND arguments as
currently specified.
