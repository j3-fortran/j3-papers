Subject: Definition of base_addr is ambiguous
Date: 2011 February 17
References: N1838

The definition of base_addr member of CFI_cdesc_t in 5.2.2 of N1838 is
ambiguous.  It states

   "The base address of an array is the C address of the element for
    which each subscript has the value of the corresponding lower
    bound."

In N1838 we discuss two languages, C and Fortran.  Both languages use the
term array subscript and it is not explicitly stated in which language the
subscript refers to.  The lower bound comes from the descriptor so the
usage is not as ambiguous, especially since lower bound is always 0 in C.

Edits are provided to make the definition of base_addr more precise.

[9:28] Replace "for which each subscript has" with "for which each
Fortran subscript has".
