Discussion

Unresolved technical issues 5 and 6 (pages 196 and 197) raise issues
related to the interaction between multiple images and program
termination.  The semantics for a resolution of these issues are in
paper J3/06-338r1, passed at meeting 178. This paper provides the
edits that incorporate those semantics into the standard.

Paper J3/06-338r1 included an unresolved option of hard wiring the
value of status variable for the case of attempting to synchronize
with a terminating image, or to make that value a named constant.  The
edits below implement the named constant choice. In addition, the value
of the constant was changed to be positive, as the condition really is
an error.

Edits to J3/07-007

[11:32+] In the list of <action-stmt>s in 2.1 High level syntax, add
an entry "<<or>> <allstop-stmt>".

[16:6] In the fourth sentence of 2.3.5 END statement, replace "causes
normal termination of the program" with "initiates normal termination
of the image".

[16:19] At the end of the first paragraph of 2.3.6 Execution sequence,
replace "STOP, RETURN" with "STOP, ALL STOP, RETURN".

[17:7-13] Replace the last paragraph of 2.3.6 Execution sequence by:

Termination of execution of an image occurs in three steps:
initiation, synchronization, and completion. All images synchronize
execution at the second step so that no image starts the completion
step until all images have finished the initiation step. Termination
of execution of an image is either normal termination or error
termination. An image that initiates normal termination also completes
normal termination. An image that initiates error termination also
completes error termination. The synchronization step is executed by
all images. Termination of execution of the program occurs when all
images have terminated execution.

Normal termination of execution of an image is initiated if a STOP
statement or <end-program-stmt> is executed. Normal termination of
execution of an image also may be initiated during execution of a
procedure defined by a companion processor (C International Standard
5.1.2.2.3 and 7.20.4.3). If normal termination of execution is
initiated within a Fortran program unit and the program incorporates
procedures defined by a companion processor, the process of execution
termination shall include the effect of executing the C exit()
function (C International Standard 7.20.4.3) during the completion
step.

Error termination of execution of an image is initiated if

 1) an ALL STOP statement is executed,

 2) an error condition occurs during execution of an ALLOCATE,
    DEALLOCATE, SYNC ALL, SYNC TEAM, SYNC IMAGES, SYNC MEMORY, NOTIFY,
    or QUERY statement without a STAT= specifier,

 3) an error occurs during execution of an OPEN, CLOSE, READ, WRITE,
    BACKSPACE, ENDFILE, REWIND, FLUSH, WAIT, or INQUIRE statement
    without an appropriate IOSTAT=, END=, or ERR= specifier,

 4) an error occurs during execution of a PRINT statement,

 5) an error occurs during execution of the EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE
    intrinsic subroutine and the optional CMDSTAT argument is
    not present,

 6) an error occurs during execution of the FORM_TEAM intrinsic
    subroutine and the optional STAT argument is not present,

 7) an error occurs during execution of a collective intrinsic
    subroutine, or

 8) an error condition occurs by means outside Fortran.

If an image initiates error termination, all other images that have
not already initiated termination initiate error termination.

Note 2.5a
   Within the performance limits of the processor's ability to send
   signals to other images, the initiation of error termination on
   other images should be immediate. Error termination is intended
   to cause all images to stop execution as quickly as possible.
End Note

Note 2.5b
   If an image has initiated termination, its data remain available
   for possible reference or definition by other images that are
   still executing.
End Note


[32:1-] In the Table "Adjacent keywords where separating blanks are
optional" at the end of 3.3.1 Free source form, add an entry for "ALL
STOP".

[74:16-17] In 4.5.6.4 Entities that are not finalized, replace
"execution of a STOP or END PROGRAM statement" with "execution of a
STOP, ALL STOP, or END PROGRAM statement".

[129:3] In 6.3.1 ALLOCATE statement, penultimate paragraph, replace
"execution of the program is terminated" with "error termination is
initiated".

[130:27] In 6.3.3 DEALLOCATE statement, penultimate paragraph, replace
"execution of the program is terminated" with "error termination is
initiated".

[132:19] In 6.3.4 STAT= specifier, replace the third paragraph which
begins "If an error condition occurs..." with:

"If an ALLOCATE or DEALLOCATE statement with a co-array
<allocate-object> is executed when one or more images has initiated
termination of execution, the <stat-variable> becomes defined with the
processor-dependent positive integer value of the constant
STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE from the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module
(13.8.2). If any other error condition occurs during execution of the
ALLOCATE or DEALLOCATE statement, the <stat-variable> becomes defined
with a processor-dependent positive integer value different from
STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE. In either case, each <allocate-object> has a
processor-dependent status:"

---Begin edits for subclause 8.4 STOP statement

[196:7] Change the subclause heading to "STOP and ALL STOP statements"

R855a  <allstop-stmt>  is  ALL STOP [<stop-code>]

[196:13-17] Replace the first paragraph with:

"Execution of a <<STOP statement>> initiates normal termination of
execution. Execution of an <<ALL STOP statement>> initiates error
termination of execution."

[197:1-] Delete Note 8.27, which begins "If all images execute a SYNC
ALL...".

[197:1] Replace "STOP statement" with "STOP or ALL STOP statement".

[197:5+] In Note 8.28 replace "the stop codes" with "any stop codes".
[END PROGRAM initiates normal termination but does not involve a
stop code.]

---End of edits for subclause 8.4

[198:8] In the list of 8.5.1 Image control statements, in the
penultimate entry, replace "END PROGRAM" with "END PROGRAM or STOP".

[206:4] In 8.5.7 STAT= and ERRMSG= specifiers in image execution
control statements, after the first sentence of the first paragraph,
add a new sentence: "If execution of one of these statements involves
synchronization with an image that has initiated termination, the
variable becomes defined with the value of the constant
STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE (13.8.2.6) in the ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module,
and the effect of executing the statement is otherwise the same as
that of executing the SYNC MEMORY statement."

[206:4-5] In 8.5.7 STAT= and ERRMSG= specifiers in image execution
control statements, in the second sentence of the first paragraph,
replace "If an error occurs" with "If any other error occurs", and at
the end of the sentence add "that is different from the value of
STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE."

[206:7] In 8.5.7 STAT= and ERRMSG= specifiers in image execution
control statements, in the last sentence of the first paragraph,
replace "execution of all images is terminated" with "error
termination of execution is initiated".

[206:11+] In Note 8.46 at the end of 8.5.7 STAT= and ERRMSG=
specifiers in image execution control statements, in the first
sentence replace "Which errors, if any" with "Except for detection of
images that have initiated termination, which errors". In the last
sentence of the same Note, replace "the failure of an image" with "a
synchronization error".

paragraph, replace "At normal termination of execution" with "During
the completion step of normal termination of execution".

[222:19] In 9.4.6 CLOSE statement, at the end of the 6th paragraph,
add "during the completion step of termination of execution".

[255:5] In 9.10.1 Error conditions and the ERR= specifier, second
paragraph, first sentence, replace "execution of the program is
terminated" with "error termination is initiated".

[255:23] In 9.10.2 Error conditions and the END= specifier, first
paragraph, first sentence, replace "execution of the program is
terminated" with "error termination is initiated".

[255:42] In 9.10.3 Error conditions and the EOR= specifier, first
paragraph, first sentence, replace "execution of the program is
terminated" with "error termination is initiated".

[256:23+] Add a new item to the list in 9.10.4 IOSTAT= specifier:

(2a) the processor-dependent positive integer value of the constant
    STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE (13.8.2.16) if the operation involved a team
    with more than one image and at least one of the images of the
    team has initiated termination of execution.

[256:25-26] In item (3) of the list in 9.10.4 IOSTAT= specifier,
replace "different from IOSTAT_INQUIRE_INTERNAL_UNIT" with "different
from IOSTAT_INQUIRE_INTERNAL_UNIT and SYNC_STOPPED_IMAGE".

[379:11] In the last sentence of 13.7.63
EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE... replace "execution of the program is
terminated" with "error termination of execution of the image is
initiated."

[382:13-14] In the description of the STAT argument to the 13.7.69
FORM_TEAM intrinsic subroutine, replace the final sentence with "If no
error occurs it is assigned the value zero. If any of the images of
the team has initiated termination of execution it is assigned the
value of the constant STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE (13.8.2.16) in the
ISO_FORTRAN_ENV intrinsic module. If any other error occurs, it is
assigned a processor-dependent positive value different from
STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE."

[382:18] In the last sentence before the Example in 13.7.69 FORM_TEAM,
replace "error termination occurs" with "error termination of
execution is initiated".

[438:35+] Add a new subsubclause to 13.8.2 The ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
intrinsic module, following the entry for REAL32:

13.8.2.16 STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE

The value of the default integer scalar constant STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE is
assigned to the variable specified in a STAT= specifier (6.3.4, 8.5.7)
or an IOSTAT= specifier (9.10.4), or to the STAT argument of the
FORM_TEAM intrinsic subroutine (13.7.69), if execution of the statement
with that specifier or argument requires synchronization with an image
that has initiated termination of execution. This value shall be
positive and different from the value of IOSTAT_INQUIRE_INTERNAL_UNIT.
