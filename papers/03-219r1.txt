This is a response to N1540 with subgroup comments interlarded.

                           Type-spec
                    
                         Richard Maine

The examples in 8.1.5.3 do not agree with the bnf for the select
type construct.  The examples have statements like

  CLASS IS (POINT)
  TYPE IS (POINT_3D)

According to the bnf, these should be

  CLASS IS (TYPE(POINT))
  TYPE IS (TYPE(POINT_3D))

This paper proposes that the bnf be fixed to correctly reflect
the syntax shown in the examples.  [The paper] also proposes to
correspondingly change the bnf syntax for explicitly typed
array constructors and explicitly typed allocate statements.

Subgroup agrees and notes this entails a TECHNICAL CHANGE.
Assuming a declaration like
	TYPE(T(:,:)), POINTER :: P
The syntax for array constructors changes from something like
	[ TYPE(T(10,20)) :: P ]
to
	[ T(10,20) :: P ]
and from
	ALLOCATE(TYPE(T(10,20))::P)
to
	ALLOCATE(T(10,20)) :: P



I. Why this change instead of some other?

  I believe that the examples, rather than the bnf, reflect what
  was the intent of the committee.  The bnf version sounds wordy
  and either redundant (type is type) or contradictory (class is
  type).  I believe that a lot more people studied the syntax of
  the examples than traced through the syntax of the bnf (if they
  had really traced through the bnf syntax, I'd have expected
  them to notice that the examples didn't agree with it).  As
  additional evidence, I note that papers like N1522 (and all its
  predecessors) use syntax like that of the examples instead of
  following the bnf.

  Note also, that the current bnf is new to the 03-007.  The CD
  did not require the TYPE() bit of syntax.  The bnf of SELECT
  TYPE was redone in the 03-007, apparently without this aspect
  of the difference being noticed.  If it was noticed, the
  difference was not made sufficiently clear that anyone noticed
  that it made the examples incorrect. Thus this paper is
  proposing to fix a mistake introduced in the 03-007 rather
  than to change a long-established syntax.

  Once we introduce this syntax into the bnf, I believe it is
  both simpler and more consistent to use it in two other places
  that currently derive from the same bnf, but could just as well
  use the simpler form.  Those places are explicitly typed
  allocate statements and explicity typed array constructors.
  These places are all new to f2k, so there are no compatibility
  issues.  The draft has no examples of explicit typing for
  allocate statements or array constructors.  (Perhaps it should,
  but that's a separate question.)

  The only place where we need the long-winded form that includes
  TYPE() is in <declaration-type-spec>, which is a different
  branch of the syntax tree for other reasons anyway.

II. Important f90/f95 interp question

  I think that C414 was intended to also exclude the name
  doubleprecision.  Otherwise I'm not sure what it achieves.
  If doubleprecision is allowed as a derived type name, then
  the syntax of the examples has an ambiguity (intrinsic
  keywords do not "go away" when there is some other entity
  with the same name).

  The edits below include what I think is a clarification of
  this.  If people think this is a change instead of a
  clarification, then we'd probably need to list that as
  an f90/f95 incompatibility.

III. Incorporated editorial improvement

  Introducing this syntax into the bnf facilitates an overdue
  minor organizational improvement.  We can cleanly separate the
  bnf for type specification from that of object declaration.
  Currently, it is a bit odd that the syntax for a type
  specification is mixed in with the section on object
  declaration, even though parts of it have nothing to do with
  object declaration.

  We will move the bnf for type specification into...surprise...
  the section talking about types.  The fact that this eliminates
  a bunch of forward references from chapter 4 into chapter 5
  gives an extra hint that this is where it belonged all along.
  This also eliminates much duplication between 4.5 and 5.1.1.

  This move isn't required.  We could keep all the bnf where it
  currently is in chapter 5, but I think this an editorial
  improvement.  If a majority thinks otherwise, that question is
  separarable (but my proposed edits would need revision).

IV. Edits

  [33:8+] Insert

     A type is specified in several contexts by a <<type specifier>>.

       R400a <type-spec> <<is>> <intrinsic-type-spec>
                        <<or>> <derived-type-spec>

       C400a (R400a) The <derived-type-spec> shall not specify an
                     abstract type (4.5.6).

  {Seems like a good place for this - right after we've introduced
   intrinsic and derived types, and before any of what used to be
   forward references to this concept.  This first edit is the one
   where the syntax change in the definition of <type-spec> is.}

  [34:15] "5.1" -> "4.4" {We are moving that material}

  [35:27+] Delete [69:16-22] (R503) and move all but the last line
      of it to here as R401a, renaming it to <intrinsic-type-spec>.

      Move [70:21] (R507) to here as R401b.

      Subgroup changed R401a to R401b in this edit:
      Move [71:20-21] (C526) to here, changing (R503) to (R401b)

|	Extra edit from the editor (see paper 03-230):
|	[71:20] Delete "in <kind-selector>".

      Subgroup changed this edit.
      [36:7], [38:1,2], [39:10], [40:15], [42:23]
             Delete "(R503)"   (6 times).

  [43:10-11] Delete this para.  {No longer says anything useful.}

  [36:8-9], [38:4,5], [39:13], [40:16-17], [42:24-25]
    "the data entity is of type" -> "the type specified is" (6x)

 

  {The phrase "the data entity" in several places is confusing.
   We aren't necessarily talking about any particular data entity,
   or multiple ones might be relevant, depending on context.  In
   this section we are just talking about what type is specified,
   so we'll say that.  The relationship of types to entities is
   discussed elsewhere and is just a confusing irrelevancy here.
   The above edit is not mandatory; it is a separable question.}

Subgroup added additional edit.
[38:5-6] Replace
      ", ... (0.0D0)." with ", the kind value is KIND(0.0D0) and the type 
      specified is <<double precision real>>"."
 
Subgroup deleted an edit here.
  
  {Replacement for material that will be deleted from chapter 5.}

  [40:14+] Insert heading "4.4.4.0a Character type specifier"

  [40:17+] Move [74:1]-[75:2] to here,
     after changing the "<type-spec>" at [74:30] to
     "<intrinsic-type-spec>".
     {Much of the [74:30-35] para is about <declaration-type-spec>,
      which our new definition of <type-spec> excludes; this change
      gets both cases, as we need it to.}

Subgroup changed this edit.
[75:4+4-5] Move these two code lines to [73:2+11+] (after COMPLEX).

  [40:17+++] Insert heading "4.4.4.0b Character literal constant"

  {Character declarations are messier than the other intrinsic
   type declarations.  It takes a substantial subclause in chapter
   5 to give all its details.  The above edits mostly just copy
   that subclause to chapter 4.  It has enough references to things
   all over the document that it fits about as well (or poorly)
   either place, but once we move the other <intrinsic-type-spec>
   stuff, this would look pretty lonely in chapter 5.}

  [44:2] Before 'the same' add 'DOUBLEPRECISION or'.

  [69:9] replace line with
       "R502 <declaration-type-spec> <<is>> <intrinsic-type-spec>
                                     <<or>> TYPE(<derived-type-spec>)

  {Handle the cases where we need the TYPE().}

Subgroup modified the edit here.
  [69:Note 5.2] before "or" insert ", a SELECT TYPE construct,"

  [69:23] "(R503) The <type-spec>" ->
          "(R502) The TYPE(<derived-type-spec>)"

  {Previous edits removed R503 from here.  For C503 to still apply to
   all the same cases, we basically need 2 copies of it (or one
   copy that refers to 2 bnf rules).  One copy was added above
   as C400a.  The other copy stays here with some changes.  Another
   paper makes the 4.5.3 xref more sensible.}

  [73:3] "Type specifiers" -> "Declaration type specifiers"

  [73:4] "<<type specifier>>" -> "<declaration-type-spec>"

  [73:7]-[75:8]  Delete sections 5.1.1.1 to 5.1.1.6, replacing them
  with the sentence

     "An <intrinsic-type-spec> in a type declaration statement is
      used to declare entities of intrinsic type."

  {Much of 5.1.1.1 to 5.1.1.6 already duplicated material in
   chapter 4.  The parts that weren't already in chapter 4 have
   been added above.}

  [75:11-15] Delete this para.

  {The parts of [75:11-15] that make any sense are already in 4.5.
   The "If the <derived-type-spec> contains a <type-name>" part
   makes no sense because the <type-name> isn't optional.}

  {There are no edits needed in chapter 8; the above edits make
   <type-spec> be the right thing.}

Subgroup added an edit.
[75:20] Delete "or".
