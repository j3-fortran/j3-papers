TITLE: Questions about internal files
KEYWORDS: internal file, data transfer
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

QUESTIONS:

Question 1:

Fortran 2003 does not seem to prohibit this kind of recursive internal
input/output.  Was this program intended to be standard-conforming?
If so, then what does the program print?

MODULE m1
  CHARACTER(20) :: ifile = ''
CONTAINS
  CHARACTER(3) FUNCTION foo()
    WRITE(ifile, *) 'QWERTY'
    foo = 'abc'
  END FUNCTION
END MODULE

PROGRAM ex1
  USE m1
  WRITE(ifile, *) 'xyz', foo(), 'zyx'
  PRINT *, ifile
END PROGRAM

Question 2:

Fortran 2003 does not seem to prohibit this kind of recursive internal
input/output.  Was this program intended to be standard-conforming?
If so, then what does the program print?

MODULE m2
  CHARACTER(20) :: ifile = 'abc def ghi jkl mno '
  CHARACTER(3) :: char
CONTAINS
  CHARACTER(3) FUNCTION foo()
    READ(ifile, *) char
    foo = 'abc'
  END FUNCTION
END MODULE

PROGRAM ex2
  USE m2
  WRITE(ifile, *) 'xyz', foo(), 'zyx'
  PRINT *, ifile
  PRINT *, char
END PROGRAM

Question 3:

Fortran 2003 does not appear to prohibit modifying a character
variable when it is being used as an internal file in a data transfer
statement that is currently executing.  Was this program intended to
be standard-conforming?  If so, then what does the program print?

MODULE m3
  CHARACTER(20) :: ifile = ''
CONTAINS
  CHARACTER(3) FUNCTION foo()
    ifile = 'bad thing to do?'
    foo = 'abc'
  END FUNCTION
END MODULE

PROGRAM ex3
  USE m3
  WRITE(ifile, *) 'xyz', foo(), 'zyx'
  PRINT *, ifile
  PRINT *, flag
END PROGRAM

Question 4:

Fortran 2003 does not appear to prohibit referencing a character
variable when it is being used as an internal file in a data transfer
statement that is currently executing.  Was this program intended to
be standard-conforming?  If so, then what does the program print?

MODULE m4
  CHARACTER(20) :: ifile = ''
  LOGICAL :: flag = .FALSE.
CONTAINS
  CHARACTER(3) FUNCTION foo()
    IF (ifile == ' xyz') THEN
      flag = .TRUE.
    END IF
    foo = 'abc'
  END FUNCTION
END MODULE

PROGRAM ex4
  USE m4
  WRITE(ifile, *) 'xyz', foo(), 'zyx'
  PRINT *, ifile
  PRINT *, flag
END PROGRAM

ANSWER:

All of these examples were intended to be prohibited.
Edits are provided to prohibit referencing or defining a variable used
as an internal unit as a result of evaluating any output list items,
or transferring values to any input list item.

EDITS:

In section 9.5.3.4, after the seventh paragraph:
    "If an internal file has been specified, an input/output list item
    shall not be in the file or associated with the file."

add these paragraphs [196:29+]:

  "During the execution of an output statement that specifies an
  internal file, no part of that internal file shall be referenced,
  defined, or become undefined as the result of evaluating any output
  list item.

  During the execution of an input statement that specifies an
  internal file, no part of that internal file shall be defined or
  become undefined as the result of transferring a value to any
  input list item."

TITLE: Value of decimal exponent for a real zero value
KEYWORDS: Data edit descriptors, Numeric editing, decimal exponent,
          zero value
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

QUESTION:

     In formatted output, what is the value of the
     decimal exponent produced for a real zero value
     under the D, E, EN, ES, and G edit descriptors?

ANSWER:

     In such a case, the decimal exponent should have
     the value zero whether or not a nonzero scale factor
     is in effect.   Edits are supplied to make this clear.

DISCUSSION:

The Fortran 2003 standard does not specify what the value of the
decimal exponent of a real zero value should be under formatted
output.  Every implementation of which Sun is aware uses the value
zero for the decimal exponent unless a nonzero scale factor is in
effect.  Different implementations format real zeros differently under
nonzero scale factors, but the difference is mainly in the form of the
mantissa and not the exponent.

EDITS:

[227:15+] At the end of the numbered list in 10.6.1 "Numeric
          editing", add:

         "(7) On output of a real zero value, the digits in the
            exponent field shall all be zero."

TITLE: Formatted output of a negative real zero value
KEYWORDS: formatted output, negative zero, IEEE
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

QUESTION:

     Suppose a Fortran processor's representation of the real zero
     value is signed.  When a negative real zero value is written
     using formatted output, does the Fortran 2003 standard require
     the representation of the zero value in the output field to be
     prefixed with a minus sign?

ANSWER:

     Yes, the negative sign is required to appear in formatted output
     of a negative zero value. In subclause 10.6.1, list item (3) at
     [227:3-4] says "The representation of a negative internal value
     in the field shall be prefixed with a minus sign." For a
     processor that distinguishes between positive and negative zero,
     there is no exemption for output at [38:1-6]. For the case of
     IEEE reals, the IEEE_IS_NEGATIVE function at [375:25] explicitly
     says that -0.0 is "negative".

EDITS:

None.

TITLE: Elemental and BIND(C)
KEYWORDS: Elemental, BIND(C), ENTRY
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

QUESTION:

 Is it allowed for a procedure to have both the BIND(C) and
 elemental attributes?

 Constraint C1242 disallows trivial ways of writing an elemental
 BIND(C) procedure. However, the following example achieves the
 effect for sub_c without violating the syntactic constraint.

   elemental subroutine sub(x)
     entry sub_c(x) bind(c)
   end subroutine sub

ANSWER:

 No, it is not allowed. Constraint C1242 was intended to disallow
 the combination of elemental and BIND(C), but it inadvertently
 failed to cover the case shown in the above example.

EDITS

 Replace C1242 in subclause 12.5.2.1 with
 [280:6-7]
 "C1242 An elemental procedure shall not have the BIND attribute.".

PROBLEM:

  Fortran 2008 Unresolved Technical issue 097 asked a question that
  also affects Fortran 2003.  Consider this example:

          INTERFACE ASSIGNMENT(=)
             SUBROUTINE s(a,b)
                 REAL,INTENT(OUT),VOLATILE :: a(1,*)

          ...
          CALL s(p,q)    ! Violation of constraint C1233 [271:9-11],
                         !  associating P with A
          p = q          ! No constraint violation because
                         !  <actual-arg> syntax is not being used

QUESTION:

  Did Fortran 2003 intend to enforce constraints on <actual-arg> in
  defined assignment?

ANSWER:

 Yes, the <actual-arg> constraints and restrictions should be enforced
 in defined assignment and in defined operator evaluation.

 Edits are provided below to do this.

EDITS:

  [262:16] add at the end of the paragraph
   "All restrictions and constraints that apply to actual arguments
    in a reference to the function also apply to the corresponding
    operands in the expression as if they were used as actual
    arguments."

  [263:12] insert after "the second argument."
   "All restrictions and constraints that apply to actual arguments
    in a reference to the subroutine also apply to the left-hand side
    and to the right-hand side enclosed in parentheses as if they were
    used as actual arguments."

TITLE:  Interoperability of non-BIND derived types
KEYWORDS: Interoperability, derived type
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

INTRODUCTION

Subclause 15.2.3 of 04-007 says [398:9-12]:

  "A Fortran derived type is interoperable with a C struct type if the
   derived-type definition of the Fortran type specifies BIND(C)
   (4.5.1), the Fortran derived type and the C struct type have the
   same number of components, and the components of the Fortran
   derived type have types and type parameters that are interoperable
   with the types of the corresponding components of the struct type."

QUESTIONS

  1. Is a Fortran derived type for which BIND(C) is not specified
     interoperable with any C struct type?

  2. Does a Fortran derived type interoperate with a C struct type
     that has a different number of components?

  3. Does a Fortran derived type interoperate with a C struct type
     that specifies the same components in a different order?

  4. Does a Fortran derived type with a pointer or allocatable
     component that has interoperable type and type parameters
     interoperate with any C struct type?

ANSWERS:

None of these Fortran derived types are interoperable with any C
struct type.

TITLE:  Procedure characteristics and unlimited polymorphic

QUESTION:

Consider

    abstract interface
        function foo (x)
            class(*) x
            class(*), pointer :: foo
        end function
    end interface

    procedure (foo), pointer :: proc_ptr
    procedure (foo),         :: proc_tgt

    proc_ptr => proc_tgt

According to the rules of procedure pointer assignment at [144:39-41],
proc_ptr and proc_tgt are required to have the same interface
characteristics.  However because an unlimited polymorphic entity is
not considered to have a declared type, the rules for characteristics
of dummy data objects [256:26-32] and characteristics of function
results [257:2-8] are not applicable. In addition, rules at [145:5-6]
require that proc_ptr and proc_tgt have the same function return type.
This also does not apply to unlimited polymorphic data.

Is the example intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

Yes, the example was intended to be standard-conforming.
An edit is provided to clarify this.

The characteristics however are adequately defined.  FOO, and thus
both PROC_PTR and PROC_TGT have no type, but are polymorphic; this
precisely characterises an unlimited polymorphic entity.  Only the
requirement of type matching in 7.4.2.2 is incorrect.

TITLE:  Allocatable array on intrinsic assignment with scalar expr
KEYWORDS: allocatable array, intrinsic assignment
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

QUESTION:

Consider

    CHARACTER(:), ALLOCATABLE :: str(:)
    ALLOCATE (CHARACTER(1) :: str(0:9))
    str = 'reallocate?'

According to the third paragraph of 7.4.1.3, the variable STR should
be deallocated on this assignment because it has a deferred length
type parameter different from the <expr> ('reallocate?'); it should
then be allocated with its length type parameter the same as that of
the <expr> and with the shape and bounds of <expr>.  But the STR
cannot be allocated with the shape and bounds of the <expr> since it
is a scalar.

The standard, however, provides a possible interpretation for the
shape of <expr> two paragraphs later where it says
  "If <expr> is a scalar and <variable> is an array, the <expr> is
   treated as if it were an array of the same shape as <variable>
   with every element of the array equal to the scalar value of
   <expr>."

Q(1). Should the variable STR be reallocated in this case?

Q(2). If so, what are the values of its length type parameter, shape
      and bounds?

ANSWER:

(1) Yes, STR should be reallocated - that is the purpose of the
    combination of ALLOCATABLE and deferred type parameters.  If
    the user does not wish for automatic reallocation he can use
    "str(:) = 'do not reallocate'" instead.

(2) The length parameter of str after the assignment is 11 (the value
    returned by LEN('reallocate?')).  The shape and bounds should be
    unchanged.  An edit is provided to clarify this.

Note that the standard does not forbid, but does not specify semantics
for,

  str = 'oops'

when STR is an unallocated array with a deferred length parameter.
An edit is supplied to make it clear that this is not allowed.

Note also that this applies to parameterized derived types with
deferred type parameters.

EDITS:

  "If <variable> is an unallocated allocatable array, <expr> shall

  In the second sentence of the third paragraph of the subclause,
  change "corresponding type parameters of <expr>," to "corresponding
  type parameter of <expr>. If variable is an array and <expr> is scalar

KEYWORDS: Final subroutine, VALUE
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

QUESTION:

Currently, the F03 standard allows the VALUE attribute to be specified
for the dummy argument of a final subroutine.  This seems to defeat
the purpose of final subroutine, which is intended to apply to the
finalizable entity (the actual argument) itself.

Should the dummy argument of a final subroutine be allowed to have the
VALUE attribute?

ANSWER:

No, the VALUE attribute should not be allowed.
An edit is provided to correct this oversight.

QUESTION:

Case (v) of intrinsic inquiry function ASSOCIATED [305:5-9] says

      If TARGET is present and is an array target, the result is true
      if the target associated with POINTER and TARGET have the same
      shape, are neither of size zero nor arrays whose elements are
      zero-sized storage sequences, and occupy the same storage units
      in array element order. Otherwise, the result is false. If
      POINTER is disassociated, the result is false.

This will cause the intrinsic to return false if the POINTER is
pointer assigned to the TARGET with bounds-remapping (POINTER and
TARGET can be of different ranks).  The same issue also exists for
case (vii).

Is the POINTER associated with the TARGET if the POINTER is pointer
assigned to the TARGET with bounds-remapping?

ANSWER:

No, it is not intended that ASSOCIATED(POINTER, TARGET) return true
after pointer assignment using a bounds-remapping that changes the
shape or rank.  This was a conscious decision made in response to a
Fortran 90 interpretation request concerning dummy arguments that are
different shaped versions of the same array in the calling procedure.

KEYWORDS: Namelist input, blanks, separators
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

QUESTION:

1)  Was it intended that blanks be allowed as separators in Namelist
    Input?

Consider a namelist input fragment:

              I = 3              J = 4

  Page 243:12 says that the name-value subsequences are separated by
  value separators.

  Page 243:5 says that namelist value separators are the same as
  list directed value separators.

  Page 239:7 says those value separators are "...blanks between
  values" and then defines what the values are.

  The "J" above isn't a value, so the blanks aren't separators and
  the fragment is illegal for namelist input

2)  Is there a similar problem with namelist comments as in this
    fragment?

              I = 3           !  this is a namelist comment

  Page 245:29-30 says that a name-value subsequence is separated
  from the ! in a comment by a value separator.

ANSWER:

1)  Yes, it was intended to allow blanks as separators for namelist
input.  Edits are supplied to correct the wording in the standard.

2)  Yes, there is a similar problem with comments.  The fragment is
intended to be legal.  The edits correct the error.

EDITS:

[243:5] Replace the paragraph by
  "A value separator for namelist formatting is a value separator
   for list-directed formatting (10.9), or one or more contiguous
   blanks between a nonblank value and the following object
   designator or "!" comment initiator."

TITLE: Is UDDTIO output suitable for namelist and list-directed input
KEYWORDS: UDDTIO, list-directed I/O, namelist I/O
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

QUESTION:

The first paragraph of 10.9.2 says that the form of the values
produced by list-directed output is the same as that required for
input.  It also says values are separated blanks or commas, etc.

The first paragraph of 10.10.2 has similar words for namelist output.
It also requires that the variable name be produced in upper case and
that the output consist of name-value pairs.

Is it intended that output produced by user-defined derived-type
output routines conform to these rules?

ANSWER:

No, it was not intended to constrain the user-defined derived-type
output values.  There should be an exception similar to the one for
adjacent undelimited character values.  User-defined derived-type
output fields do not need to be readable by either namelist or
list-directed input.

EDITS:

[241:5]  Add at the end of the paragraph
"The form of the values produced by a user-defined derived-type output
routine invoked during list-directed output is specified by the
invoked routine.  This form need not be compatible with list-directed
input."

[246:4]  After "and logical values" add ", and output produced by
user-defined derived-type output"

[246:7]  Add at the end of the paragraph
"The form of the output produced by a user-defined derived-type output
routine invoked during namelist output is specified by the
invoked routine.  This form need not be compatible with namelist
input."

TITLE: Deallocation and finalization of bounds-remapped pointers
KEYWORDS: deallocate, finalization, bounds-remapping, pointer
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

INTRODUCTION:

Consider the following example assuming a derived type of X is
declared previously and made accessible to the current scoping unit,

    type(X), pointer :: a(:), b(:,:)

    allocate (a(100))
    b(1:10, 1:10) => a

    DEALLOCATE (b)

QUESTION:

    (a) Is DEALLOCATE (b) in the example intended to be standard
        conforming?

    (b) If the answer to (a) is yes, and also assume type X has
        finalizers of both rank-one and rank-two, then which finalizer
        should be invoked by the DEALLOCATE statement.

ANSWER:

    (a) Yes, the example is intended to be standard conforming.  The
        deallocation of pointer b should be executed successfully.

    (b) The Standard is clear about how the finalizations are
        processed in this case.  In 4.5.5.1, the first step in
        invoking the appropriate final subroutine requires a
        finalizer matching the rank of the entity being finalized.
        In this case, object b is being finalized and therefore the
        rank-two final subroutine of type X will be invoked with
        object b as the actual argument.

EDITS:

    None.

TITLE: Inquire by unit inconsistencies
KEYWORDS: inquire, unit, not connected
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

QUESTION:

There are many things that can be inquired about, such as ACTION
or READ, that are purely file or connection properties.  In
some cases, such as ACTION, the specifier description includes
"If there is no connection [the result is] the value UNDEFINED"
or similar words.  In other cases, such as READ, there seems
to be a tacit assumption that there is a file connected to the
unit.  The descriptions refer to "the file" and don't specify a
result if there is no connection.  In most cases, there is a
phrase like "if the processor is unable to determine if the
file ... [the result is] {UNDEFINED, UNKNOWN, -1, etc.}".

Question 1)  Are the inquire specifiers DIRECT, ENCODING,
FORMATTED, NAMED, NEXTREC, NUMBER, POS, READ, READWRITE,
SEQUENTIAL, SIZE, STREAM, UNFORMATTED, and WRITE allowed
in an INQUIRE by unit when there is no file connected to the
unit?

Question 2)  If so, should the descriptions for the above
specifiers be clarified by adding phrases such as "if there is
no file specified or connected" to the "UNKNOWN" result
descriptions?

ANSWER:

Question 1)  Yes.  In an inquiry by unit, the specifiers have
little meaning when there is no file connected to the unit.
However, the standard should specify the results.

Question 2)  Yes, edits are supplied below.

NUMBER: F03/0107
TITLE: Are the IEEE_* elemental routines required
KEYWORDS: IEEE, elemental routines
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

QUESTION:

The descriptions for all of the IEEE elemental intrinsics listed in
14.9 say something like "shall not be invoked if
IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE(X) is false".

I believe this was to allow a careful programmer to do something
like

        if (IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE(x)) then
               x = IEEE_SCALB(x,2)
        else
               x = x*4
        endif

and program around partial IEEE support.

But 14.9.2 says that "IEEE_ARITHMETIC contains the following
[routines] for which IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE(X) [is] true"

I'd read that as saying the functions aren't there for cases where
IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE is false.  But, then, there is no way to
program around their absence.  The example above will fail at load
time because IEEE_SCALB is absent.

If a processor provides the IEEE_ARITHMETIC module must it
provide versions of all of the intrinsics for all of the available
datatypes, including those for which IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE() is false?

ANSWER:

Yes, edits are provided to make this clear.

DISCUSSION:  It was intended that the above coding snippet could be
used by a careful programmer to program portably for processors which
have varying degrees of IEEE support.  This might require processors
to provide some stub function for each routine and for each non-IEEE
datatype they support.  If a program invokes one of the stub routines,
it is a run-time programming error.  Nevertheless, a program which
has references to the routines, but doesn't invoke them, must load
and execute.

EDITS:

In the first paragraph of subclause 14.9.2 [370:8-9] Replace

      "for reals X and Y for which IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE(X) and
       IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE(Y) are true"

    with

      "for all reals X and Y"

NOTE:

The following note should be inserted at the end of the section on
IEEE arithmetic in a future standard:

"The standard requires that code such as

        if (IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE(x)) then
               x = IEEE_SCALB(x,2)
        else
               x = x*4
        endif

be executable.  The elemental functions in the IEEE_ARITHMETIC
module (14.9.2) must exist for all real kinds supported by the
processor, even if IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE returns false for
some kinds.  However, if IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE returns false
for a particular kind, these functions must not be invoked
with arguments of that kind.  This allows a careful programmer
to write programs that work on processors that do not support
IEEE arithmetic for all real kinds.

The processor might provide stub routines which allow the program
to link and execute, but which will abort if they are invoked."

TITLE: Is IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN consistent with the other IEEE_SUPPORT
       functions
KEYWORDS: IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN, IEEE support functions
DEFECT TYPE: Clarification
STATUS: Passed by WG5 ballot

QUESTION:

The restriction of IEEE_IS_NAN requires that IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN returns
the value true.  The restrictions for the similar functions
IEEE_IS_{FINITE, NEGATIVE, and NORMAL} all require that
IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE be true.  This is a much stronger restriction.

Should IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN also require that IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE
return true?

ANSWER:

No.  The IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN restriction is weaker than requiring
IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE but IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN is sufficient.
IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE is used in IEEE_IS_FINITE, IEEE_IS_NEGATIVE,
and IEEE_IS_NORMAL because there are no IEEE_SUPPORT_* inquiry
functions to query support for finite, negative, or normal.
IEEE_SUPPORT_INF asks about infinities not finites and
IEEE_SUPPORT_DENORMAL only covers denormals and not the other
non-finites (NaNs and Infinities).

EDITS:

None.
