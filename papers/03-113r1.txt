Summary
______________________________________
I propose to bring back deferred bindings into F2x, by introducing
abstract derived types into the language, much alike abstract types in
Java. These are essential in creating Abstract Programming Interfaces
and are much needed in Fortran 2002.

Many thanks to Van, Malcolm, Rob and Kurt for comments and also help
with the edits.

______________________________________
Important Note:
______________________________________
The syntax proposed here for deferred bindings should be chosen
according to the resolution of comment UKTC4. At present generic
type-bound procedures are nameless, and so the syntax uses
NULL(interface-name):

PROCEDURE, DEFERRED :: binding=>NULL(interface-name)
GENERIC, DEFERRED :: binding=>specific_procedure,
NULL(specific-interface-name)

But if UKTC4 is passed, then we only need one syntax, for specific
type-bound procedures, and in this case even the deferred keyword will
not be needed:

PROCEDURE(interface-name) :: binding

I give both sets of edits, together with the things in common.
______________________________________
Motivation
______________________________________
We want several things from deferred bindings:
1. They must be part of the syntax so that from the declaration of an
extensible type it is clear that a particular type-bound procedure is
deferred.
2. They must provide compile-time checks when extending the type,
forcing the user to do something with the deferred procedure (either
defer it again or override).
3. They should provide a runtime protection against envoking the
deferred procedure.
______________________________________
Solution
______________________________________
An abstract derived type is one which has the newly introduced ABSTRACT
attribute. One cannot instantiate objects of abstract type. Such types
are extensible and are used as base types in forming ``real'' types
which can be instantiated. One can never get to an object of abstract
type, even if using polymorphic pointers of abstract type, since there
is never a target of abstract type. This provides a runtime protection
against trying to envoke deferred type-bound procedures. The only tricky
possibility is using parent component selection to get to an object of
abstract type and try to envoke a deferred binding this way, but this is
detectible at compile time and is forbidden explicitly in the edits below.

The main use of abstract types is when forming base types which have no
default or natural implementation for certain operations and are
therefore incomplete. An example is given at the end of this paper.
Deferred type-bound procedures can appear only in such derived types.
They represent operations whose implementation is deferred to extensions
of the abstract type. Only when there are no more deferred bindings can
the ABSTRACT attribute be removed. This provides the compile-time
reminder for the user that he must override all bindings if he wants to
declare a nonabstract type.

I note that the prohibition against instantiation is useful in itself
even without any deferred bindings. Therefore one can have an abstract
type which has no deferred bindings.

Edits
______________________________________

As usual, I kindly ask for help with the edits, as it is likely I have
forgotten or misworded something. See the example below for an
illustration of the syntax:

Part 1: Add ABSTRACT as a derived type attribute
_________________
42:2+ Add ABSTRACT:
or ABSTRACT

42:9+ Add:
C417a (R425) If the type definition contains any deferred bindings
(4.5.1.5) or inherits (4.5.3.1) any deferred bindings, ABSTRACT shall
appear.

42:10 Add ABSTRACT:
If ABSTRACT, EXTENDS or EXTENSIBLE appears...

Part 2: Prohibit instantiation of ABSTRACT types
_________________

For constructors: [57:29+] Add:
C468a (R449) The <derived-type-spec> shall not specify an abstract type
(4.5.3).

For declarations: [67:24+] Add:
C503a (R503) The <derived-type-spec> or the <type-alias-name> shall not
specify an abstract type (4.5.3).

Internal Note to J3: CLASS(abstract-type) can of course appear. Also
note that type-spec in ALLOCATE is automatically covered. Also note that
C_F_POINTER is also covered since we do not allow polymorphic FPTR.

Part 3: Add DEFERRED bindings:
_________________

VERSION 1: If UK TC4 is accepted:
_________
44: 17 Replace PROCEDURE with:
PROCEDURE [(<deferred-binding-interface>)]

44: 19+ Add:
R441a: <deferred-binding-interface> is <interface-name>

44: 20+ Add constraint:
C444a (R441) =><binding> shall appear only if
<deferred-binding-interface> does not appear.

44: 20-21 Replace "If...appears," by:
If neither =><binding> or <deferred-binding-interface> appear,

45: 11+ Add:
C455a (R440) NON_OVERRIDABLE shall appear in the <binding-attr-list> of
a deferred binding (4.5.1.5)

49: 4 Add to the end of the sentence:
or the abstract interface specified in <deferred-binding-interface>.

49:5+ Add:
A binding that specifies a <deferred-binding-interface> is a <<deferred
binding>>. A <binding> is not given for deferred bindings. Deferred
bindings can only appear in abstract types (4.5.3.3).

Also add glossary term for <<deferred binding>>:
<<deferred binding>> (4.5.1.5): A binding that specifies a
<deferred-binding-interface> (4.5.1.5). Deferred bindings can only
appear in abstract types (4.5.3.3).

VERSION 2: If generic tbps stay as they are:
_________
Discussion:
The basic syntax for specific bindings is:
PROCEDURE, DEFERRED :: binding_name => NULL(abstract_interface_name)
The basic syntax for generic bindings is:
GENERIC, DEFERRED :: generic_spec=>procedure_name,
NULL(abstract_interface_name)
One can only put NULL(abstract_interface_name) is DEFERRED is there. In
this version I require the DEFERRED attribute if the binding is still
deferred (this makes a difference for generic bindings), but this can be
changed.

44: 20-21 Replace "If...appears," by:
If =><binding> does not appear and the binding does not override an
inherited deferred binding,

45: 3+ Add:
or DEFERRED

45: 11+ Add:
C455a (R441) DEFERRED shall appear if and only if <deferred-binding>
appears.

C455b (R442) DEFERRED shall appear if and only if <deferred-binding>
appears or any of the inherited generic bindings with the same
<generic-spec> are deferred.

C455c (R440) DEFERRED and NON_OVERRIDABLE shall not both appear in the
same <binding-attr-list>.

45: 19+ Add:
or <deferred-binding>

45: 18+ Add:
R445a: <deferred-binding> is NULL(<deferred-binding-interface>)
R445b: <deferred-binding-interface> is <interface-name>

49: 4 Add to the end of the sentence:
or the abstract interface specified in <deferred-binding-interface>.

49:5+ Add:
A binding that specifies the DEFERRED attribute is a <<deferred
binding>>. Deferred bindings can only appear in abstract types (4.5.3.3).

Also add glossary term for <<deferred binding>>:
<<deferred binding>> (4.5.1.5): A binding that specifies the DEFERRED
attribute (4.5.1.5). Deferred bindings can only appear in abstract types
(4.5.3.3).

For both VERSION 1 and 2:
_________
56: 11+ Add new subsection:

4.5.3.3 Abstract types

An <<abstract type>> is a type that has the ABSTRACT attribute.  If a
type has any deferred type-bound procedures (4.5.1.5) it shall have the
ABSTRACT attribute.  If a type has the ABSTRACT attribute an object of
the type shall not be declared, constructed or allocated.

Also add glossary entry for <<abstract type>>:
<<abstract  type>> (4.5.3.3): A type that has the ABSTRACT attribute.
An object of abstract type shall not be declared, constructed or allocated.

Add NOTE to end of 4.5.3.3:
Abstract types can be extended into nonabstract types once all the
procedure bindings (including inherited ones) are nondeferred. Deferred
bindings (4.5.1.5) delegate the implementation of a type-bound procedure
to  extensions of the type, and can only appear in abstract types.
Objects  of abstract type cannot be instantiated (brought into
existence), and  deferred type-bound procedures cannot be invoked.
Abstract types are  common in Abstract Programming Interfaces (APIs). An
example is given in Note XXX.

Add another NOTE with example (I can extend the example for section C if
accepted):

    The following API defines an object that can be displayed in an X
window:

    TYPE, EXTENSIBLE, ABSTRACT :: DRAWABLE_OBJECT
       INTEGER, DIMENSION(3) :: RGB_COLOR=(/0,0,0/) ! White
       REAL, DIMENSION(2) :: POSITION=(/0.0,0.0/) ! Centroid
    CONTAINS
Either VERSION 1:
_________
        PROCEDURE(RENDER_X), PASS(OBJECT) :: RENDER
or VERSION 2:
_________
       PROCEDURE, DEFERRED, PASS(OBJECT) :: RENDER=>NULL(RENDER_X)
    END TYPE DRAWABLE_OBJECT

    INTERFACE
       SUBROUTINE RENDER_X(OBJECT, WINDOW)
          CLASS(DRAWABLE_OBJECT), INTENT(IN) :: OBJECT
          CLASS(X_WINDOW), INTENT(INOUT) :: WINDOW
       END SUBROUTINE RENDER_X
    END INTERFACE

    We can declare a nonabstract type by extending the abstract type:

    TYPE, EXTENDS(DRAWABLE_OBJECT) :: TRIANGLE ! Not ABSTRACT
       REAL, DIMENSION(2,3) :: VERTICES ! In relation to centeroid
    CONTAINS
       PROCEDURE, PASS(TRIANGLE) :: RENDER=>RENDER_TRIANGLE_X ! Not
shown here
    END TYPE TRIANGLE

Part 4: Prohibit invoking deferred bindings:
_________________
Discussion: There is a danger of referencing a deferred type-bound
procedure by using the parent component selection (type casting) mechanism:
CALL object_of_nonabstract_type%abstract_parent_component%abstract_binding()
which would result in a run-time error. We prohibit this explicitly.
Also dangerous are data pointers, if they somehow end up pointing to an
object of abstract type:
polymorphic_pointer_of_abstract_type=>object_of_nonabstract_type%abstract_parent_component
Another possibility is for a procedure pointer to end up pointing to a
deferred type-bound procedure. This seems impossible in the current
standard, so we are OK, but let's forbid it just in case.

[262:27+] Insert:
C1225a (R1219) If <data-ref> is not polymorphic, <binding-name> shall
not be the name of a deferred binding.

[262:27+] Note 12.16a [in a box]: A deferred binding specified by
accessing a parent component shall not be invoked.

[143:18+] Add:
C724a (R739) The type of <data-target> shall not be abstract (4.5.3.3).

[143:28+] Add:
C728a (R741) The <proc-target> shall not be a deferred binding.

5. Ammend NULL's syntax
_________________
VERSION 2 only, nothing for 1:
_________
293:27 Add deffered:
NULL ([MOLD]) Returns disassociated, unallocated, or deferred result

334:18+ Add to end of sentence:
or designates a deferred type-bound procedure binding.
and remove the second or

Internal J3 Note: NOT ALL EDITS OF NULL ARE FINISHED. Use 007-R2 as
guide. It depends on what the syntax ends up being.
