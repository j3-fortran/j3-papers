Subject: Further wording improvements within 4.5 and without
Date: 3rd April 2003

1. Introduction

Further wording improvements are possible.
            
References in the edits to pages within subclause 4.5 are to 03-166.

2. Discussion - wording improvement

We could have some examples of type parameter order and component order.  Edits
for nontrivial (i.e. using type extension) examples are below.  These examples
occur before type extension is discussed, but are simple enough that they are
hopefully more illuminating than confusing.
            
The subclause on pointer components is redundant gibberish, notable not only
for what it repeats from other sections and the syntax, but also for what it
fails to mention.  Even what is there is misleading (possibly wrong).  It ought
to be completely replaced!
            
The subclause on default initialisation fails to specify what is going on with
pointer components adequately.

3. Discussion - technical nonsense
            
16.4.2.1.2 is ungrammatical and incorrect.  The disjunction is in the wrong
place, 4(c) specifies an impossible case, and it fails to correctly specify
what happens for passing allocatable/pointer objects to nonallocatable
nonpointer INTENT(OUT) dummies (we are supposed to get default init here, but
the current text fails to do this - which would be an incompatibility with F95
for a start!).
            
The easiest way to fix this, with the least duplication of predicates (some is
always going to be necessary) is to delete item 5 and fix item 4 to cover the
item 5 case correctly as well as the above-mentioned non-covered case.  (The
alternative way would be to add the contents of 4a with modifications to 5.
But this results in longer more complicated text.)

4. Edits to 02-007r3/03-166

[46:7+] Insert new note
  "Note 4.25a
   Given
     TYPE :: t1(k1,k2)
       INTEGER,KIND :: k1,k2
       REAL(k1) a(k2)
     END TYPE
     TYPE,EXTENDS(t1) :: t2(k3)
       INTEGER,KIND :: k3
       LOGICAL(k3) flag
     END TYPE
   the type parameter order for type T1 is K1 then K2, and the type parameter
   order for type T2 is K1 then K2 then K3."
{Add a nontrivial example showing type parameter order.}
            
[48:3] After "pointer" insert "(2.4.6)".
{Useful cross-reference for the first mention of pointers in this chapter.}
            
[48:3-8] Delete "Pointers have ... associated.".
{Stuff repeated here from 2.4.6 and the syntax rules.  The default
initialisation stuff does not belong here and is misleading - it fails to
mention anything other than an "initial" status (default init does not just
affect "initial" status) and fails to give a cross-reference to ch16 where it
lays out the rules for pointers being affected at runtime by default init.}
            
[48:3-8] Append to paragraph
  "A pointer component may be a data pointer or a procedure pointer."
{If we're going to have introductory waffle, let's mention something useful.}
            
[49:0+3] Delete "=> NULL()".
{This is irrelevant, distracting, and not explained in this example.  It is
explained and exampled properly in the default init subclause.}
            
[49:13] After "polymorphic" insert "(5.1.1.8)".
{A useful forward reference.}
            
[49:16] Delete the reference "(4.5.3.2)".
{Default init should be explained under default init, not under pointer comps!}
            
[50:1-] Insert
  "If <null-init> appears for a pointer component, that component in any object
of the type has an initial association status of disassociated (16.4.2.1) or
becomes disassociated as specified in 16.4.2.1.2."
{This is where the rules are.}
            
[51:1-] Move Note 4.32 to here.
            
[51:8+] Insert new note
  "Note 4.36a
   Given the same type definitions as in note 4.25a, the component order of
   type T1 is just A (there is only one component), and the component order of
   type T2 is A then FLAG.  The parent component (T1) does not participate in
   the component order."
{Insert nontrivial example of component ordering.}
            
[52:3,6,7] Change "<binding-private-stmt>" to "<private-bindings-stmt>", thrice.
[54:3] Change "<binding-private-stmt>" to "<private-bindings-stmt>", once.
{Better name for this statement.}
            
[404:17] Change "a nonpointer nonallocatable" to "an".
[404:20] Insert "nonpointer nonallocatable" before "dummy".
[404:21] Insert "nonpointer nonallocatable" before "local".
[404:24-25] Delete.
{Fix technical nonsense.}
