NUMBER: F03/0112
TITLE: attributes allowed for dummy arguments in defined assignments
KEYWORDS: defined assignment, dummy argument, attributes
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 meeting

INTRODUCTION:

It seems the standard is quite loose in allowing various attributes
declared for the dummy arguments used in a defined assignment
(7.4.1.4).  In particular, attributes such as POINTER and ALLOCATABLE
can be declared for dummy arguments in the defined assignment.
However the interpretations on their declarations need to be
clarified.

QUESTION:

Consider the follow subroutines (assuming a derived type DT already
defined)

Q1. Are POINTER and ALLOCATABLE attributes allowed for the second
    dummy argument in defined assignment?

    interface ASSIGNMENT (=)
    subroutine defAssgn1 (dt1, dt2)
        type(DT), intent(out) :: dt1
        type(DT), POINTER, intent(in) :: dt2
    end subroutine
    end interface

    In 12.3.2.1.2 [263:10-12], the standard says the following
    "A defined assignment is treated as a reference to the subroutine,
     with the left-hand side as the first argument and the right-hand
     side enclosed in parentheses as the second argument."

    This statement seems to prohibit the use of subroutine defAssgn1
    for defined assignment since a pointer enclosed in parentheses
    refers to its associated target not the pointer itself, as
    indicated by rules in 7.1.4.1 [123:39-124:3].


Q2. Are POINTER and ALLOCATABLE attributes allowed for the first
    dummy argument in defined assignment?

    interface ASSIGNMENT (=)
    subroutine defAssgn2 (dt1, dt2)
        type(DT), POINTER, intent(out) :: dt1
        type(DT), intent(in) :: dt2
    end subroutine
    end interface

    There are no rules in the standard that disallow this declaration.
    However the use of POINTER/ALLOCATABLE attributes on the first
    dummy argument is very doubtful.  Since POINTER/ALLOCATABLE
    attributes don't disambiguate generic declarations(16.2.3), their
    use will prevent the normal declarations of defined assignments,
    wherein dt1 is declared without POINTER or ALLOCATABLE attribute.

ANSWER:

Yes to both questions.  The interface blocks are not defective.  The
standard places very few restrictions on the arguments to defined
assignment subroutines:  [363:6...]

  Each of these subroutines shall have exactly two dummy arguments.
  Each argument shall be nonoptional.  The first argument shall have
  INTENT (OUT) or INTENT (INOUT) and the second argument shall have
  INTENT (IN). ...

Preventing the first argument from having the POINTER attribute violates
F90.

A program couldn't reference defAssgn2 by way of defined assignment
because the right-hand side of a defined assignment is treated as an
expression enclosed in parentheses which would have neither the POINTER
nor the ALLOCATABLE attribute.

EDITS:

None.
