The Problem
===========

Assume a collection of data that are connected by pointers and a public
pointer to access one, that gives access to the others, e.g., a linked
list, a tree, ....

Assume the code is large.

Assume there are numerous places in the code where the collection is
examined by using a pointer to "step through" the objects.

Assume a new style directive is handed down that requires protection
against changing such objects except within the module where their type
is defined.

Present solution
================

This would presently require to replace all examination of the objects
with procedures, which would have a cost proportional to the size of the
program, not the magnitude of the change.

Alternative solution
====================

Allow to attach a PROTECTED attribute to the definition of the type,
meaning that objects of the type cannot be changed except within the
module where the type is defined.

Module variables can have the PROTECTED attribute, but this does not
protect variables accessed by pointer association, or as dummy
arguments.

Example
=======

module M

  type, protected :: List_Item_t
    character(42) :: Name = ""
    integer :: Age = 0
    type(list_item), pointer :: Next => null()
  end type List_Item_t

  type(list_item_t), public, protected :: First => null()

contains

....

end module M

program P

  use M, only: First, List_Item_t
  type(list_item_t), pointer :: List_Item

! Code to fill the list
...
! Print the list

  list_item => first
  do while ( associated(list_item) )
    if ( list_item%name == "Van Snyder" ) list_item%age = 39
    print *, trim(name), " is age ", list_item%name
  end while

end program P

The processor ought to issue an error message about changing
list_item%name.

Relationship to protected components
====================================

Paper 18-165 does not propose to allow a specification that PROTECTED is
the default accessibility of components.  Assuming it were to do so, a
"not protected" attribute would be necessary.  Maybe PUBLIC would work.
The PROTECTED attribute for module variables is described in subclause
8.5.15 in 18-007r1.  It is not an <access-spec>, so it might seem a bit
weird to use PUBLIC to contradict a default PROTECTED attribute.

Assuming a specification that PROTECTED is the default accessibility of
components is provided, the problem described in the previous section
would be addressed.  Rather than the type being protected, all its
components would be protected.

It's not obvious that protected components could be made to solve all
the problems that would be solved by a PROTECTED type attribute.

It would be desirable, at least for economy of description, to define
EVENT_TYPE, LOCK_TYPE, and a proposed NOTIFY_TYPE to be protected types.
It is not obvious this could be accomplished by specifying that all
their components are protected.

See 14-165r1.

C441b therein allows an object of protected type to be the <variable> in
a statement specifier, provided the <variable> is required to be of a
protected type that is defined in an intrinsic module.  This provides a
loophole for EVENT_TYPE, LOCK_TYPE, and a proposed NOTIFY_TYPE.

The description of C441f therein needs to have "that does not have
INTENT(IN)" appended.

History
=======

As far as I can tell by looking at 2004 and 2005 spreadsheets, there was
no "protected components" proposal for Fortran 2008.  The proposal for
protected types, 04-167, had a "hate dislike like love" score of
0-0-11-0.  It had an ABC priority score of 0-4-8.  It was dropped from
the work plan proposal during meeting 169, based upon priority.  It
appears in 04-370r1.xls, but not in 04-370r2.xls.
