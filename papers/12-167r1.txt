Discussion:
---------

N1930 requirement 4 adds five new atomic subroutines to the Coarray
TS. This paper provides semantics and edits for these routines.


Semantics:
----------

The operation of the atomic add intrinsic:

   atomic_add (atom, value, old)

is to perform atomically:

   if (present (old) ) old = atom
   atom  = atom + value


The operation of the bitwise AND intrinsic

   atomic_and (atom, value, old)

is to perform atomically:

   if (present(old)) old = atom
   atom = iand(atom,INT(value,ATOMIC_INT_KIND))


The operation of the compare and swap intrinsic

   atomic_cas (atom, old, compare, new)

is to perform atomically:

   old = atom
   if (old == compare) atom  = new


The operation of the bitwise OR intrinsic

   atomic_or (atom, value, old)

is to perform atomically:

   if (present(old)) old = atom
   atom = ior(atom,INT(value,ATOMIC_INT_KIND))


The operation of the bitwise exclusive OR intrinsic

   atomic_xor (atom, value, old)

is to perform atomically:

   if (present(old)) old = atom
   atom = ieor(atom,INT(value,ATOMIC_INT_KIND))



Edits:
---------

Insert these subclauses in Clause 7 of the TS:

"7.1 General

Detailed specification of the generic intrinsic collective subroutines
CO_BCAST, CO_MAX, CO_MIN, CO_REDUCE, and CO_SUM are provided in
7.2. Detailed specification of the the generic intrinsic atomic
subroutines ATOMIC_ADD, ATOMIC_AND, ATOMIC_CAS, ATOMIC_OR, and
ATOMIC_XOR are provided in 7.3.  The types and type parameters of the
arguments to these intrinsic subroutines are determined by this
specification. The “Argument” paragraphs specify requirements on the
actual arguments of the procedure. All of these intrinsics are pure.


7.3 New atomic subroutines

7.3.1 ATOMIC_ADD (ATOM, VALUE [, OLD])

 Description. Atomically perform an add operation.

 Class.  Atomic subroutine.

 Arguments.

 ATOM shall be scalar and of type integer with kind ATOMIC_INT_KIND,
           where ATOMIC_INT_KIND is the named constant in the
           intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV. It is an INTENT (INOUT)
           argument. ATOM becomes defined with the value of
           ATOM + VALUE.

 VALUE shall be scalar and of type integer. It is an INTENT (IN)
           argument.

 OLD (optional) shall be an scalar of the same type as ATOM. It is an
           INTENT (OUT) argument. If it is present, it becomes defined
           with the value of INT(ATOMC, KIND (OLD)), where ATOMC has
           the value of ATOM used for the performing the add operation.

 Example1. CALL ATOMIC_ADD(I[3], 42) causes I on image 3 to have its
           value replaced with its original value plus 42.

 Example2. CALL ATOMIC_ADD(M[4], N, ORIG) causes M on image 4 to have
           its value replaced with its original value plus the value
           of N on this image. ORIG becomes defined with 99 if the
           original value of M as 99 on image 4."


7.3.2 ATOMIC_AND (ATOM, VAULE [, OLD])

 Description. Perform atomic bitwise AND, optionally after
              fetching the input value of ATOM.

 Class.  Atomic subroutine.

 Arguments.

 ATOM      shall be scalar and of type integer with kind
           ATOMIC_INT_KIND, where ATOMIC_INT_KIND is a named constant
           in the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV. It is an
           INTENT (INOUT) argument. ATOM becomes defined with the value
           IAND(ATOM,INT(VALUE,ATOMIC_INT_KIND)).

 VALUE     shall be scalar and of type integer. It is an INTENT(IN)
           argument.

 OLD (optional) shall be an scalar of the same type as ATOM. It is an
           INTENT (OUT) argument. If it is present, it becomes defined
           with the value of INT(ATOMC, KIND (OLD)), where ATOMC has
           the value of ATOM used for the performing the bitwise
           AND operation.

Example.  CALL ATOMIC_AND (I[3], 6, Iold) causes I on image 3 to
          become defined with the value 4 and the value of Iold on
          the image executing the statement to become defined with
          the value 5 if the value of I[3] was 5 when the bitwise
          AND operation executed.


7.3.3 ATOMIC_CAS (ATOM, OLD, COMPARE, NEW)

 Description. Conditionally swap values atomically.

 Class.  Atomic subroutine.

 Arguments.

 ATOM shall be scalar and of type integer with kind ATOMIC_INT_KIND or
           of type logical with kind ATOMIC_LOGICAL_KIND, where
           ATOMIC_INT_KIND and ATOMIC_LOGICAL_KIND are the named
           constants in the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV. It is an
           INTENT (INOUT) argument. If the value of ATOM is equal to
           the value of COMPARE, ATOM becomes defined with the value
           of INT (NEW, ATOMIC_INT_KIND) if it is of type integer, and
           with the value of NEW if it of type logical.

 OLD shall be scalar and of the same type as ATOM. It is an INTENT
           (OUT) argument. It becomes defined with the value of INT
           (ATOMC, KIND (OLD)) if ATOM is of type integer, and the
           value of ATOMC if ATOM is of type logical, where ATOMC has
           the same type and KIND as ATOM and has the value of ATOM
           used for the compare operation.

 COMPARE  shall be scalar and of the same type and kind as ATOM.
          It is an INTENT(IN) argument.

 NEW      shall be scalar and of the same type as ATOM. It is an
          INTENT(IN) argument.

 Example. CALL ATOMIC_CAS(I[3], OLD, Z, 1) causes I on image 3 to
          become defined with the value 1 if its value is that of Z,
          and OLD to become defined with the value of I on image 3
          prior to the comparison."


7.3.4 ATOMIC_OR (ATOM, VALUE [, OLD])

 Description. Perform atomic bitwise OR, optionally after fetching the
              input value of ATOM.

 Class.  Atomic subroutine.

 Arguments.

 ATOM      shall be scalar and of type integer with kind
           ATOMIC_INT_KIND, where ATOMIC_INT_KIND is a named constant
           in the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV. It is an
           INTENT (INOUT) argument. ATOM becomes defined with the value
           IOR(ATOM,INT(VALUE,ATOMIC_INT_KIND)).

 VALUE     shall be scalar and of type integer. It is an INTENT(IN)
           argument.

 OLD (optional) shall be an scalar of the same type as ATOM. It is an
           INTENT (OUT) argument. If it is present, it becomes defined
           with the value of INT(ATOMC, KIND (OLD)), where ATOMC has
           the value of ATOM used for the performing the bitwise
           OR operation.

Example.  CALL ATOMIC_XOR (I[3], 1, Iold) causes I on image 3 to
          become defined with the value 3 and the value of Iold on
          the image executing the statement to become defined with
          the value 2 if the value of I[3] was 2 when the bitwise
          OR operation executed.


7.3.5 ATOMIC_XOR (ATOM, VALUE [, OLD])

 Description. Perform atomic bitwise exclusive OR, optionally after
              fetching the input value of ATOM.

 Class.  Atomic subroutine.

 Arguments.

 ATOM      shall be scalar and of type integer with kind
           ATOMIC_INT_KIND, where ATOMIC_INT_KIND is a named constant

           INTENT (INOUT) argument. ATOM becomes defined with the value
           IEOR(ATOM,INT(VALUE,ATOMIC_INT_KIND)).

 VALUE     shall be scalar and of type integer. It is an INTENT(IN)
           argument.

 OLD (optional) shall be an scalar of the same type as ATOM. It is an
           INTENT (OUT) argument. If it is present, it becomes defined
           with the value of INT(ATOMC, KIND (OLD)), where ATOMC has
           the value of ATOM used for the performing the bitwise
           exclusive OR operation.

Example.  CALL ATOMIC_XOR (I[3], 1, Iold) causes I on image 3 to
          become defined with the value 2 and the value of Iold on
          the image executing the statement to become defined with
          the value 3 if the value of I[3] was 3 when the bitwise
          exclusive XOR operation executed."
