===========
The Problem
===========

Probably no rational person would rename the NULL intrinsic to
something else or rename some other function to be NULL, but it
might happen in someone's test suite.  Consider the following:
  MODULE procedures
    INTRINSIC null
    EXTERNAL mynull
  END MODULE procedures
  MODULE confusion
    USE procedures, ONLY: foobar=>null, null=>mynull
  END MODULE confusion

If you then
  USE confusion
in some program unit, it is clear that in the executable statements
of that program unit, you would use the name FOOBAR to reference
the NULL intrinsic function, and any uses of the name NULL would
reference the function MYNULL.  What do you use for pointer
initialization in your declarations?
1. The BNF is hard-coded for you to use NULL( ).
2. Most of the text says you should reference the NULL intrinsic
   function (i.e., use FOOBAR( )).
3. One spot in the text even asserts that by writing NULL( ) you
   will reference the NULL intrinsic function (even though that
   normally references MYNULL in this scoping unit).

It would appear that this is a contradiction that needs to be
fixed.  The approach chosen in this paper is to change the
declarations to use the same syntax that is used in the executable
statements.

"NULL ( )" => "<null-init>" in each of the following places:
  42:43 44:16,23 45:19 66:19 68:33 84:15,42 85:1,3 250:14
3:21+ Is this a Fortran 95 incompatibility (because of the BNF
  changes) or not (because we remain compatible with the text
  assertions)?
66:20 Move to 66:18-
66:19+ Insert
"
R507a <null-init> is <function-reference>
C505a (R507a) <function-reference> shall be a reference to the
      NULL intrinsic function with no arguments

NOTE 5.2a
A <null-init> nearly always has the form NULL ( ).
"
68:34 Delete final sentence of paragraph.
404:10 OK? no action needed?
