I think that 5(c) needs an assumed-type qualification, but does not
have it.

The actual arguments to assumed-type dummies do NOT have to be
interoperable types ([5:15-16] and [26:2-3]), but two references to
descriptors imply that they do.  As the constraints are elsewhere, the
wording is redundant anyway.


Edits to N1854:
---------------

[28:21] After "The dummy argument is", add "assumed-type and".

[28:31] Delete "of interoperable type and type parameters".

[31:12] After "or rank", add "and of such a type".
