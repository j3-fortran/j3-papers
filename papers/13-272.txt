Subject: Added restriction on OLD in ATOMIC intrinsics in TS 18508

Discussion
----------

It was noted that, according to the current wording in TS 18508, the
OLD argument could be a coarray, thus requiring two
synchronizations for a single atomic operation. This should be
disallowed.

Edits to N1967 (TS 18508 draft)
--------------------------------------

[16:6] In 7.3.1 after "same type as ATOM" insert " and shall 
not be a coarray or a subobject of a coarray".

[16:20] In 7.3.2 after "same type as ATOM" insert " and shall 
not be a coarray or a subobject of a coarray".

[16:35] In 7.3.3 after "same type as ATOM" insert " and shall 
not be a coarray or a subobject of a coarray".

[17:9] In 7.3.4 after "same type as ATOM" insert " and shall 
not be a coarray or a subobject of a coarray".

[17:22] In 7.3.5 after "same type as ATOM" insert " and shall 
not be a coarray or a subobject of a coarray".
