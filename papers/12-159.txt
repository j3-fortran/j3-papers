NUMBER: F08/0080
TITLE: Array constructors with polymorphic values
KEYWORDS: Array constructor, polymorphic
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Q1.  Consider

  Program m198_003a
    Type :: t
      Real a
    End Type
    Type,Extends(t) :: t2
      Real b
    End Type
    Class(t),Allocatable :: x,y
    Allocate(x,Source=t2(1,2))
    Allocate(y,Source=t(3))
    Print *, [ t :: x, y ]
  End Program

Constraint C4105 of the standard, page 85, says
  "If <type-spec> specifies a derived type, all <ac-value> expressions
   in the array constructor shall be of that derived type ..."

However, although the declared type of X is type T, its dynamic type
is type T2.

Does this program conform to the standard?

Q2.  Consider

  Program m198_003a
    Type :: t
      Real a
    End Type
    Type,Extends(t) :: t2(n)
      Integer,Len :: n
      Real b(n)
    End Type
    Class(t),Allocatable :: x,y,z
    Allocate(x,Source=t2(3)(1,[2,3,4]))
    Allocate(y,Source=t(5))
    Allocate(z,Source=t2(4)(6,7))
    Print *, [ x, y ]
  End Program

4.8 paragraph 2 of the standard says
  "If <type-spec> is omitted, each <ac-value> expression shall have
   the same length type parameters; in this case, the declared type
   and type parameters of the array constructor are those of the
   <ac-value> expressions."

However, although the length type parameters of the declared types of
X, Y and Z are the same (all being the empty set), the length type
parameters of the dynamic types are not: Y has no dynamic length type
parameters, and the value of the dynamic length type parameter N of X
and Z are different.

Does this program conform to the standard?

Q3.  Consider

  Program m198_003c
    Type,Abstract :: t
      Real a
    End Type
    Type,Extends(t) :: t2
      Real b
    End Type
    Class(t),Allocatable :: x,y
    Allocate(x,Source=t2(1,2))
    Allocate(y,Source=t2(3,4))
    Print *, [ x, y ]
  End Program

This appears to conform to the standard, but the dynamic type of the
array constructor is the same as its declared type, and is therefore
abstract.  Is this intended to conform to the standard?

ANSWER:

A1. This program was intended to be conforming.
    An edit is supplied to clarify the standard.

A2. This program was intended to be conforming.
    An edit is supplied to clarify the standard.

A3. This program was not intended to be conforming.
    An edit is supplied to add the necessary requirement to the
    standard.

EDITS:

[85:8-9] In 4.8, C4105,
  Change "all <ac-value> expressions in the <array-constructor> shall
          be of that derived type and"
  to     "the declared type of each <ac-value> expression in the
          <array-constructor> shall be that derived type and".

[85:10] In 4.8, C4106,
  Change "not be unlimited polymorphic"
  to     "have a declared type that is not abstract".

[85:13-14] In 4.8p1,
  Change "each <ac-value> expression in the array constructor shall
          have the same length type parameters;"
  to     "corresponding length type parameters of the declared type of
          each <ac-value> expression shall have the same value;".
