Discussion
----------

The first paragraph of the Introduction includes a discussion that
this standard is a revision of Fortran 2008. The citation in that
sentence is to 4.3.4, which is the subclause on Fortran 2003
compatibility.  Compatibility with Fortran 2008 is in 4.3.3.


Edit to 17-007
--------------

[xviii:3] In Introduction, para 1, change "4.3.4" to "4.3.3".
