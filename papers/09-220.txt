The only place that the term "image-independent" is in used in 4.5.6.2,
where there is a requirement that finalizations occur in the same order
on different images. It was indended to ensure that deallocations of
allocatable coarrays occur in the same order on all images so that
allocatable coarrays can be stored in symmetric memory. Unfortunately,
as 09-210 points out, it makes other requirements on the
implementation.

We should remove the requirement. Removal will not prevent an
implemention that uses symmetric memory from ensuring that deallocations
occur in the same order on all images.

Edits:

[76:9] and [76:13] In 4.5.6.2 The finalization process, item (2) of the
list in para 1 and in para 2 delete "and image-independent".

[76:15+] In 4.5.6.2 The finalization process, after para 3, add
    "NOTE 4.47+
    An implementation may need to ensure that when an event causes more
    than one coarray to be deallocated, they are deallocated in the same
    order on all images."
