  /J3

    The J3 meeting (#185) was called to order at 8:00 AM, Monday,
    August 11, 2008, at the Emerald Suites, Las Vegas, NV, USA,
    by the J3 chair, Dan Nagle.

    Bill Long is acting secretary for this meeting.

1.1 Opening business                             D. Nagle

    The Chairman welcomed everyone.

1.1.1 Remarks from the chair                     D. Nagle

    J3 needs to prepare for WG5 meeting and reply to comments.
    We need to prepare the OWG-V document.

1.1.2 Adoption of agenda                         D. Nagle

** motion: Adopt the agenda as amended (moved by Bill Long/
           seconded by Van Snyder): passed by unanimous
           consent {uc}

1.1.3 Approval of Meeting 184 minutes            D. Nagle

** motion: Approve paper 08-195, the minutes of meeting #184
           (Snyder/Long): uc

1.1.4 INCITS/SDB report (if any)                 D. Nagle

    INCITS want observers (guests) to be limited to attending
    only one meeting, after which they must pay the fees.
    This affects J3.

1.1.5 OWG-V report (if any)                      D. Nagle

    Dan thinks it is very important for Fortran to have an annex for
    the Draft of the OWG-V document.  Draft is n0134.pdf in the
    "member" Tutorials directory. Read Chapter 6. In September
    OWG-V may become WG23.  Governments will adopt the OWG-V standards,
    along with contractors and sub-contractors.   Thus, it is
    important to have Fortran in the draft.  Customers may also want
    vendors to have a switch to certify conformance or identify
    non-conformance.

1.1.6 ISO/WG5 report                             Van Snyder, IR

    The next WG5 meeting is a joint meeting with J3 in Tokyo in
    November, 2008.

    US TAG has to vote to approve the Corrigendum 3 and to form
    the delegation for the November meeting.  Otherwise, no report.

1.1.7 J11 Liaison report (if any)                C. Rasmussen

    Nothing new to report on J11.

    Dan reported that C1x will have threads in the C standard as
    the way to put in parallelism.  C++ has already decided to
    incorporate threads.  The threads designed will be a thin
    wrapper allowing an implementation to use pthreads, Linux
    threads or Windows threads.

1.1.8 MPI Liaison report (if any)                C. Rasmussen

    The group is meeting every 6 weeks; September in Ireland.
    Matthijs van Waveren is going to that meeting. They are very
    interested in our efforts, especially type(*) and asynchronous.
    They are waiting for us.

1.1.9 UPC Liaison report (if any)                D. Nagle

    The group is still planning a September meeting:  they are going
    for "fast track" standard status. Rex Jaeschke and Dan are helping
    with this. JTC1 grants permission to form a committee to propose
    a fast track standard, etc. Currently UPC is standardized by an
    independent agency.

1.1.10 Treasurer's report                         V. Snyder

    The ending balance at the previous meeting was $2280.05 .
    
** motion: Skip the meeting fee for meeting #186 (Ingrassia/
           Snyder): uc

1.1.11 Beginning membership report       S. Whitlock via e-mail

    08-212}.  Dan is following up on this.
 
    HP is in jeopardy of losing membership because of missing 2 of

1.1.12 Local arrangements                         D. Nagle

    Jeanne Martin is acting local host and will provide supplies
    as requested.

    We are rotating hosts:
      - Japan is hosting the WG5/J3 meeting 186 in Tokyo in Nov-2008
      - Dan Nagle will host J3 meeting #186 in Feb-2009

1.1.13 Comments from members

    Van reported on an IFIP WG2.5 meeting that he attended in
    Toronto. They want interval arithmetic in the IEEE floating point
    standard, as well as "complete" arithmetic (fixed point with ~6400
    bits max) for reliability.  IEEE did not accept the proposal. But
    they though there should be a separate IEEE standard - Baker
    Kearfott (Univ. of Louisiana), John Pryce (UK), Nathalie Reval
    (France) are forming the committee.  Van is writing the edits.

    Van reported on an HPC computing on workstations meeting.  Over
    half were on GPUs or CELL processors. People will want to write
    software for this type of architecture.

    No other comments from members were recorded.

1.2 Tutorials (if needed)

    Dan led an OWG-V presentation and discussion.  In n0134.pdf,
    Clause 6 covers programming issues.  The basic idea is that
    there is a collection of features in programming languages that
    are known to be associated with bugs. Their goal is to identify
    these features and discourage their use.  ADA, C, C#, Fortran,
    NSA, CERT, DHS, and FDA are represented on the OWG-V committee.
    Each language can have an Annex.

    Dan wants to submit the Fortran Annex to OWG-V in September.  He
    wants it written this week, and later approved by WG5 in November.

                 2) dimension(..)   : 4
                 3) undecided       : 1

        Result:  dimension(..), proposed by Martin, will be used


        Vote 3: Does assumed-rank include rank=0 (scalar)?
                Defer to the discretion of subgroup based on
                the complexity of the edits

        Vote 4: Should we add a RANK intrinsic (to the TR)?  
                Yes: 8  No: 1  Undecided: 0
 
  /interp

    In Tuesday's discussion on 08-263 "Interp F03/0112", it was
    noted that there could be an incompatibility between Fortran
    95+TR and Fortran 20003 if we keep the edit

      SV: on interp F03/0112: 
          1) Believe the answer in 08-259 "LB #17 results"    : 4
          2) Change the answer to be consistent with the edit : 2
          3) Believe the answer and insert a Note             : 4 
          4) Still don't understand                           : 1

5.1 Closing business

  Meeting Arrangements:

    Dan and Van had a nice lunch with Valerie on Thursday.  The
    current owner is selling off Emerald Suites.  She's back to
    Marriott.  Van supplied dates for next year. Price is $93, 126,
    105/day depending on the time of year at Residence Inn Hughes
    Center.  Fairfield Inn, 1/2 block north, has rates: $89,
    including meeting room, shuttle to strip and airport, internet
    in rooms and meeting rooms, and breakfast. Green Valley Courtyard
    in Henderson is another option. Rooms are $79, shuttle to strip
    and airport, no breakfast.

    We need to know the hours of operation of the shuttle in Henderson.

    SV: Where would you like to meet next year (can vote for more than
        one):

      1) Residence Inn : 4
      2) Fairfield     : 4
      3) Green Valley  : 4
      4) Undecided     : 4+

    No consensus, except for going somewhere other than Emerald
    Suites.  Need more information about Courtyard in Henderson.
    (Note that the Courtyard is 2.5 miles from the airport - closer
    than Emerald Suites.)

    Van noted that since all three of the options are the same company
    (Marriott) and in Valerie's territory, we do not have to stick with
    the same one for every meeting.

    Van will get more information. We can discuss again in November. No
    real hurry at the moment.

5.2 Review of action items (if any)

    1) Dan Nagle: Attend PL22 next week
    2) Dan Nagle: Ask Malcolm Cohen to produce 08-007r3, with line
       numbers

5.3 Future meetings                               V. Snyder

    joint with WG5, Masayuki (Makki) Takata, acting host

    Meeting #187 is February 9 - 13, 2009, in Las Vegas, NV,
