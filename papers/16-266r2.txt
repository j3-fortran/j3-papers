1. Edits
--------

[277:7-8 13.7.2.3.8p2 Input/output rounding mode]
Replace "decimal value" with "decimal or hexadecimal value" twice.

[280:16 13.7.6p3 User-defined derived type editing]
Replace "that derived type" with "the derived type of
the item".

[281:6-7 13.8.1.2p1 T, TL and TR editing]
Replace "the left tab ... of that record" with
"character position one of that record becomes the left tab limit"
{because this is easier to parse (and shorter) than the existing
inside-out phrase}.

[285:24+1-6 NOTE 13.31 Null values]
Replace "All blanks in a list-directed input record" with
"All blanks encountered during list-directed input".
(The term "list-directed input record" is poorly specified, and
leaves ambiguous what happens when list-directed input starts
in the middle of a record as positioned by a prior nonadvancing
input.)

[289:29 13.11.3.3 Namelist input values]
Before the sentence beginning "Such a sequence", insert the
sentence "The delimiters may be apostrophes or quotes; the value of
the <DELIM= specifier>, if any, in the <OPEN statement> for an
<external file> is ignored."

[289:34+ NOTE 13.36 13.11.3.3 Namelist input values]
Delete the first and third sentences of this note, which read as
normative text; they have been inserted in the previous edit. The
note remains with the sentence "The delimiter is required..."

[290:2 13.11.3.4p1(3) Null values]
Change the third bullet from:
"zero or more blanks preceding the first value separator and following
an equals, or"
to:
"a value separator that is the first nonblank character following an
equals, or"

[291:21 13.11.4.3p3 Namelist output records]
Replace "will be produced by namelist formatting" with "is placed".

[291:23 13.11.4.3p3 Namelist output records]
Replace "is produced by namelist formatting" with "is placed in
the output record".

2. Optional edits at the editor's discretion
--------------------------------------------
[273:27 13.7.2.3.3p1 E and D editing]
[274:12 13.7.2.3.4p2 EN editing]
[275:8 13.7.2.3.5p2 ES editing]
Replace the comma before "otherwise" with a semicolon.

3. Rejected edits
-----------------

[267:20-21 C1306] Replace the constraint:

"C1306 (R1308) <w> shall be positive for L or A edit descriptors [and
may be positive or zero for all other edit descriptors]. {Because the
syntax for <w> doesn't allow a sign.
(This adds no value.)

[269:22-32 13.4p9] Replace "in a manner identical to the way it is
positioned when" with "as if by"; delete "is processed".  {Compare to
[278:35 13.7.4p5].}
(The text on 278 adds a much longer description of the process
that would be necessary to repeat here. The current wording is fine.)

[270:7-8 13.5p4] Replace "in a manner identical to the way it is
positioned when" with "as if by"; delete "is processed".  {Compare to
[278:35 13.7.4p5].}
(See above.)

[271:15+ 13.7.2.1p1(3)] Insert a note:

"NOTE 13.7a
   The effect of the scale factor is described in 13.8.5."
(Nowhere here is the scale factor even mentioned.)

[273:3 13.7.2.3.2p7 F editing]
Append a sentence: "The scale factor has no effect
on hexadecimal input editing." {If it's true.  It should also be stated
in 13.8.5.  Compare to [274:9 13.7.2.3.4p1].}
(It is true because hexadecimal input always has an exponent, so is
excluded from scale factor, but see 16-284 for a related issue)

[276:2- NOTE 13.13+ ES edit descriptor]
Insert a note:

"NOTE 13.13a
  The effect of the ESw.dEe edit descriptor is the same as the effect of
  the 1PEw.dEe descriptors."
(While true, such a note doesn't add value.)

[276:10 13.7.2.3.6p2] Insert "decimal" before "digits".
(Unnecessary - this text is discussing the number of digits - what those
digits are is described in line 21.)

[277:25 13.7.2.4p1] Append a sentence "The scale factor has no effect on
B, O, or Z editing." {If it's true.}
(Unnecessary as 13.8.5 doesn't include B,O,Z in the list of edit
descriptors it affects)

[282:14 13.8.5p1] Insert "only" before "the editing done...".
(Unnecessary.)

[285:23 13.10.3.2p3] Replace "<do-variable> in the input list becomes"
with "<do-variable>s in the input list become" {because there might be
more than one of them}.
(The existing text already allows for that.)

[289:34+1-5 NOTE 13.36] The first and third sentences of NOTE 13.36
appear to be normative, and the first sentence is (improperly) written
as normative text.  Make the first and third sentences normative, in a
paragraph at [289:34+ 13.11.3.3p7+.  Leave the second sentence in the
note.
(Replaced with an edit in section 1.)

4. Questions and comments without edits
---------------------------------------

[281:4-7 13.8.1.2p1] The relationship of the left tab limit to a data
transfer statement executed after a nonadvancing data transfer statement
to the same unit should be explicitly specified.  It shouldn't be
necessary to prove a theorem involving "immediately prior to nonchild
data transfer."
(JOR finds the current wording sufficient.)

[282:13-30 13.8.5] The relationship of P editing to hexadecimal input
during F editing should be described here.  The relationship of P
editing to a data transfer statement executed after a nonadvancing data
transfer statement should be obvious here.  Something like "The value of
$k$ is zero at the beginning of execution of a [nonchild?] data transfer
statement."  If that's true.
(P editing has no effect on input of a hexadecimal-significand field as
such values always have exponents and are thus exempt from scale factors.
Paper 16-284 adds words related to this. Your second question is addressed
adequately by 12.5.2 paragraphs 3 and 5.)

[283:24-29 13.10.2p2] Can r be zero?
("r is an unsigned, nonzero, integer literal constant.")

[287:8-13 13.10.4p9-10] If character sequences are both preceded and
followed by value separators, null values would be produced. This
contradicts 13.10.4p12.
(This text is specifically about delimited character sequences, so
the delimiters would not create null values.)

[287:18+1-2 NOTE 13.33] Is the length of a list-directed output record
bounded by the RECL= specification in the OPEN statement?
(Yes (229:34), but it could be shorter.)

[287:29-38 13.11.2p2] More needs to be said about constraints and
restrictions on <designator>, especially concerning pointer and
allocatable components, whether a pointer component can appear after a
<part-ref> with nonzero rank, whether two <part-ref>s with nonzero rank
can appear, ....
(You're welcome to submit a paper on this topic.)

[288:23-289:39 13.11.3.3] Subclause 13.11.3.3 could be substantially
shortened and simplified by reference to list-directed input.
(Almost but not quite. There are subtle differences, especially for
character input. It's not the right time to worry about this.)

[289:1 13.11.3.3p1] Can r be zero?
(No - 288:35)

[290:2 13.11.3.4p1(3)] This appears to imply that input to an array A
using "A= ,10" specifies a value for A(3), i.e., there are two null
values.  The discussion of blanks as null values appears to contradict
subclause 13.11.3.5.
(This is handled by an edit in section 1.)

[291:12+1-2 NOTE 13.40] Is the length of a namelist output record
bounded by the RECL= specification in the OPEN statement?
(Yes (229:34), but it could be shorter.)
