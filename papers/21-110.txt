Subject: Enumeration types discussion specs and syntax

1. Introduction

Two things have become clear over the last year:
    - our approach to "true enumeration types" has become too complicated,
      unnecessarily so, and needs to be cut back to basics (at least this
      time around);
    - even the basic approach to "true enumeration types" does not satisfy
      a significant part of the community, which needs better support for
      interoperable "enum types" than we currently provide with
      ENUM,BIND(C).

The requirements for "better interoperable enums" are partially in conflict
with the requirements for "true enums", so this paper proposes doing both
of these separately, and not trying to shoehorn one into the other.

It is possible to do either feature without the other.
    - "Simpler true enumerations" fulfills more of the WG5 requirements.
    - "Better interoperable enums" fulfills a large part of the type-safety
      WG5 requirement, and fixes a long-standing and well-known deficiency
      in the ENUM,BIND(C) feature.
There is a good case for doing both of these, and a very strong case for
doing at least one of them.


2. Better interoperable enums

2.1 Requirements

Basically, have all the features of ENUM,BIND(C) plus a type name. The type
name needs to provide type safety for procedure calls and assignment.

2.2 Specifications

(A) Retains the ability to specify the internal representation, and thus to
    have gaps and duplicate values, that ENUM,BIND(C) currently has.

(B) Provides a type name that can be used to declare variables of an
    interoperable enum type.

(C) Variables of that type can take on any representable value, just as
    they can in C.

(D) Dummy arguments of that type are only type-compatible with actual args
    with the same type and with integer expressions involving values or
    the enumerators of the type.

(E) Upwards compatible with ENUM,BIND(C); the enumerators will still be of
    type integer, and can be used freely in integer expressions.

(F) Assignment is type-safe in the same way as argument association.

(G) No polymorphic entities with a declared type that is an enum type.

(H) No intrinsic constructor of this type.

(I) An enum entity in an i/o list acts like integer. For output that's the
    same as wrapping it in INT(...), for input it's the same as having an
    integer temporary assigned with "var = typename(tempo)".

(J) Enum types can be used in generic resolution vs. other enum types
    and derived types, but not vs. integer (ambiguity).

Comments:
    (1) It might be thought that it would be harmless to allow assignment
        to/from integers, but requiring an INT(...) or typename(...) in
        such cases is not an onerous requirement. The special weaseling for
        expressions involving the enumerators will handle most common cases
        anyway.
    (2) We could be stricter and allow only the enumerators themselves to
        be type-compatible, but that would disallow IOR(enum1,enum2), and
        enums are sometimes used to define bit-patterns for that purpose.
    (3) We could be less strict and merely require a warning diagnostic
        from compilers. I believe that strict typing is better than
        warnings.
    (4) We could instead have the enumerators be literal constants of the
        new type. That would be easier in the standard, but more strict on
        the user, and make it harder to gradually upgrade a program with
        the existing ENUM,BIND(C) to use enum type names.

2.3 Syntax and semantics

The syntax is to extend the ENUM,BIND(C) statement with a type-name:

<enum-def-stmt> <<is>> ENUM, BIND(C) [ :: <enum-type-name> ]

The <enum-type-name> is for a new kind of type, which is like a derived
type with an anonymous integer(KIND=kind of the enumerators) component,
but that is not a BIND(C) type, not extensible, and not a sequence type.
We will call this an "enum type", as it acts more or less like C enums.

Comment: The concept that all derived types are structure types is pretty
         well embedded into the standard at this time. Either we split
         derived types into structure types and enum types, or we add enum
         types as a separate concept and mention it everywhere necessary.
         The latter is probably easiest to do without making mistakes.
         But how we describe this in the standard can be left to the edits
         paper; here we are just describing the effect we want.

Thus it cannot be extended, and CLASS(<enum-type-name>) is not allowed, but
it uses "normal" type compatibility (not the complicated sequence rules),
and can be used in TYPE IS (<enum-type-name>) when the SELECT TYPE selector
is CLASS(*).

Values of the type can be created using the constructor
    enum_type_name ( integer expression )
There being no actual components or component name, there is no keyword
form of this constructor.

The internal representation of an enum type is the same as the integer kind
of its enumerators, and its set of values is the set containing every
    enum_type_name ( integer value )
for all the integer values of that kind.

Entities of an enum type are declared using the TYPE specifier, just as if
it were a derived type.

ALTERNATIVE SYNTAX for the definition:

    <enum-def-stmt> <<is>> ENUM, BIND(C) [ , NEWTYPE :: <enum-type-name> ]

This would make it more obvious that the <enum-type-name> is a new type and
not an alias for a kind of INTEGER.

POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL SYNTAX FOR F202y (or later; not this time):

    <enum-def-stmt> <<is>> ENUM, BIND(C) [ , ALIAS :: <enum-alias-name> ]

This would define a type alias instead of a new type, which is how the ENUM
feature started out. TYPE(<enum-alias-name>) would have identical effect to
INTEGER(KIND(one of the enumerators)).

2.4 Examples

Module enum_mod
  Enum,Bind(C) :: myenum
    Enumerator :: one=1, two, three
  End Enum
  Enum,Bind(C) :: flags
    Enumerator :: f1 = 1, f2 = 2, f3 = 4
  End Enum
Contains
  Subroutine sub(a) Bind(C)
    Type(myenum),Value :: a
    Print *,a ! Acts as if it is Print *,Int(a).
  End Subroutine
End Module

Program example
  Use enum_mod
  Type(myenum) :: x = one           ! Valid by (F)
  Type(myenum) :: y = myenum(12345) ! Explicit constructor
  Type(myenum) :: x2 = myenum(two)  ! Constructor not needed but valid
  Call sub(x)
  Call sub(three)
  Call sub(myenum(-Huge(one)))
End Program

Program invalid
  Use enum_mod
  Type(myenum) :: z = 12345         ! INVALID - no enumerator in the expr
  Call sub(999) ! Need a cast.
  Call sub(f1)  ! Wrong enum type.
End Program

3. Simpler true enumerations

3.1 Requirements

A true enumeration type is a new type, not a renaming of integer.
The enumerators are of this type.
No requirement should be placed on the internal representation.
The operations of First, Last, Next, and Previous are available.
Relational operations between objects of the same enumeration type are
available.
Explicit conversion to/from type Integer is available.
No arithmetic or other operations.

3.2 Specifications

(a) The enumeration type is a user-defined type that is not a structure
    type, i.e. it is rather like a derived type but has no components.

Comment: It behaves somewhat like a derived type with a hidden anonymous
         component. Either we split derived types into structure types and
         other types, or we just add a new kind of type.

(b) No polymorphic entities with a declared type of an enumeration type.

(c) Variables of the type can take on only values of the type, or be
    undefined. Values of the type are the enumerators only.

(d) An intrinsic constructor of the type provides conversion from type
    Integer only. The INT intrinsic provides conversion to type Integer.

(e) Strict type safety, viz the enumerators are of that type.

(f) No DO loop or other such; that functionality is available, though with
    extra verbosity, using integers and conversions.

(g) Enumerators come without any enhanced namespace management, i.e. their
    names are normal class one names.

(h) The Next et al operations are provided intrinsically, not type-bound.

(i) Enumeration variables are initially undefined, like other variables.

(j) Relational operations order by the order of definition of the
    enumerators, e.g. the first one defined is less than all the others.

Comments:
    (11) Extending an enumeration could be useful, but at this time that
         would be an unnecessary frippery. We need to focus on having a
         solid and reliable basic feature.
    (12) Similarly, a DO index of an enumeration type would sometimes be
         useful, but is an unnecessary frill at this stage.
    (13) I note that enumerators as class one names is not only simpler
         but what WG5 asked us to do in the first place.
    (13) Fortran already has basic namespace management (USE ONLY and
         renaming). Some ideas for extensions to that have already been
         floated (for a future revision, possibly F202y); we should not
         preempt that with a complicated feature here.
    (14) Intrinsic operations and functions are already generic and don't
         conflict with user-defined operations and functions. Making the
         operations on enumerations type-bound would be likely to inhibit
         future namespace management features.
    (15) Being able to specify an initial value would be useful, but is not
         core functionality.

3.3 Syntax

<enumeration-type-def> <<is>> <enumeration-type-stmt>
                                <enumeration-enumerator-stmt>
                                [ <enumeration-enumerator-stmt> ]...
                              <end-enumeration-type-stmt>

<enumeration-type-stmt> <<is>>
    ENUMERATION TYPE [ [ , <access-spec> ] :: ] <enumeration-type-name>

Constraint: The <access-spec> shall only appear in the specification part
            of a module.

<enumeration-enumerator-stmt> <<is>>
    ENUMERATOR [ :: ] <enumerator-name-list>

<end-enumeration-type-stmt> <<is>>
    END ENUMERATION TYPE [ <enumeration-type-name> ]

Constraint: If <enumeration-type-name> appears on an END ENUMERATION TYPE
            statement, it shall be the same as on the ENUMERATION TYPE
            statement.

The <access-spec> on an ENUMERATION TYPE statement specifies the
accessibility of the <enumeration-type-name> and the default accessibility
of its enumerators. The accessibility of an enumerator may be confirmed or
overridden by an <access-stmt>.

An enumeration type is a user-defined type that is not a structure type.

Comment: See above comments re terminology.

An entity of enumeration type is declared using the TYPE specifier, just as
if it were a derived type.

The name of the type operates as a constructor; it takes an integer and
returns a value of the type. As the type has no named component, there is
no keyword form of the constructor. The constructor returns the enumerator
value with the ordinal number of the integer value given. The integer
value shall be positive and less than or equal to the number of enumerators
of the type.

POSSIBLE ADDITIONAL SYNTAX:
    Allow [ , <access-spec ] in an ENUMERATOR statement for both these and
    for ENUM,BIND(C). It surprises me we did not think of this in F2003.

Conversion to Integer: INT(enumeration value) = the ordinal number of the
    enumerator in the type definition. The constructor typename(integer)
    returns the enumeration value with that ordinal number; integer shall
    be in the range 1...N, where N is the number of enumerators.

Relationals: Noted that a.rel.b has the same value as INT(a).rel.INT(b).

The operations First, Last, Next and Previous shall be provided as follows.

First: typename(1).

Last: HUGE(any enumeration value).

Next, Previous: New intrinsic functions with those names.
    To avoid producing bad values,
        PREVIOUS(first) = first
        NEXT(last) = last

Comment: We could choose different names here. PREV is shorter and okay.
         If we want to avoid names likely to already be in use (not that
         there is any problem with that usually), PREDECESSOR and SUCCESSOR
         would be suitable if a bit long. PRED and SUCC are horrible but
         acceptable.
