Subject: Program terminology cleanup

This was left over from paper 01-321, item 1; the terminology for
"programs" and pieces thereof needs some fixes.

Note that paper 01-321 deleted "unit" at [12:10].

Note that [9:11-12] defines a "<main-program>" as a Fortran thing,
but a "main program" can be either a <main-program> or a main
program defined by means other than Fortran.

So, we want to extend "program unit" to include procedures defined
by something other than Fortran, while a <program-unit> is a Fortran
only concept.



Edits:


[11:46] Replace "an external subprogram" with
        "an external subprogram, an external procedure defined by
         means other than Fortran"

[11:49] Replace "program unit" with "Fortran program unit"

[12:20] Replace "The" with "The Fortran form of a"

[15:5]  Replace "Execution" with "If a program contains a Fortran
        main program, execution"
