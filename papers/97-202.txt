Subject:     Edits for subobject cleanup

In working on the edits for M.2, I quickly ran into difficulties
in writing edits that clearly and unambiguously say what we mean.
It rapidly became evident that the main source of the problem was
that the existing standard had severe internal inconsistencies
in its treatment of subobjects.  Its hard to add a new feature
that has significant interaction with subobject concepts until
we first get the existing stuff right.

Thus, although I regard this paper and its edits as necessary for
the M.2 item (in case someone asks why I'm doing cleanup of the
subobject question, which isn't on our list), the edits herein
don't directly do anything about the new functionality of M.2.
That will be a separate paper (which looks like it will be a lot
simpler with the "basics" better in place).  This paper could be
considered to be an interpretation request (actually several) and
edits for f95.  It looks to me like there are several actual
errors in f95 in this area.  See below for details.

However, I've not tried to phrase this as an interp request or to
do a minimal set of edits as might be appropriate for a
corridendum.  Instead, I've aimed at getting it right for f2k.
Thus, I've included several edits that I think state things more
clearly or otherwise cleanup things that were just confusing or
strangely stated, but weren't actually wrong.  If I were trying
to do edits for an interp, they would probably be more limited.
Though some of the flaws are basic enough that its hard to do a
small, localized fix.

The fundamental flaw is that the standard is inconsistent in its
definition and use of "subobject" and related terms (notably
"parent").  In some contexts, the term subobject is used to
mean a part of an object.  This is, in fact how it is defined in
2.4.3.1 and in the glossary.  In other contexts, the term subobject
is clearly used to indicate any <data-ref> that starts from the
object in question.  These 2 definitions are not at all consistent.
They are very different concepts and both are needed.

I suspect this flaw might have come in unnoticed with the
introduction of pointers, because it is pointers that make it
wrong.  When a derived type has a pointer component, there is no
reasonable way to interpret the target of the pointer as a "part"
or "subobject" of the derived type.  There are quite a few
statements in the standard that are completely wrong if you try
to force such an interpretation.  (To pick one, from 14.7.1 - "An
object is defined if and only if all of its subobjects are
defined").  This gets even more ludicrous if there are several
pointers in the <data-ref>.

In addition to this fundamental flaw, there are quite a large
number of smaller flaws, including
  1. Failure to mention the real and imaginary parts of a complex
     object as subobjects until section 14.  I didn't think of
     this myself until I ran into the mention in section 14.
  2. Numerous places where the text seems to forget that a subobject
     is itself an object.
  3. Several blatant errors of fact, including
     a. Definition of subobject that says it only applies to
        named objects, followed on the same page by an example
        of a subobjects of an unnamed object.
     b. The statement that all subobjects of a PARAMETER array
        have the parameter attribute.
     c. And others; see below.
Plenty of separate f95 interp questions implied here if someone
wants to try to separate them out; I didn't.

I've spent about half a week pretty close to full time working on
this.  I can't swear to have caught every subtlety (I'm not that
foolish), but I think its in pretty good shape.  I'm quite
confident that this is substantially more internally consistent
than the f95 standard.

All occurances of "subobject", "parent", or "designat" (regardless
of case) in the standard were checked in developing this edit.
Note, by the way, that the term "parent" is not used very many
places at all; most occurances of the string "parent" are in the
word "parenthesis".

Here is a rough outline of the approach I've taken.  I have kept
the term "subobject" as its English usage (and its definition in
the standard) implies - objects that are actually "part" of the
parent.  I've avoided most uses of the term "parent" to minimize
possible confusions (the biggest exception is <parent-string>,
which seemed unambiguous and clear as it was).  I defined the bnf
term "designator" in place of the old "subobject" (R602) and made
both the bnf and text use that terminology.  With my definition,
a "designator" can include an unadorned name; it could be
reserved for the forms where there is at least one subobject
selector, but several things simplify if I allow it to include
simple names as well.

Enough introduction.  The edits follow.

I. Subobject designator and bnf fixes

  A "subobject designator" as defined in the standard doesn't
  necessarily designate a subobject; that is, it may designate
  something that is not a "part" of the parent in any meaningful
  sense.  It does not mesh well with the definition of subobject.
  I propose that we just define this to be an "object designator".

  In fact, once we remove the "sub" from its terminology, we get
  some other simplifications almost for "free".  We can then say
  that the name is followed by 0 or more selectors instead of 1 or
  more - that is a name itself is also a trivial case of an object
  designator.  This will allow us to just say "object designator"
  instead of "name or subobject designator" in several places.
  This simplification isn't required, but I think it worthwhile.

  Likewise the bnf term "subobject" doesn't necessarily represent
  a subobject as defined.  It invites all sorts of interpretation
  questions if the term "subobject" has one definition in the bnf
  and a different, incompatable definition in the text.

  Fortunately, the bnf term subobject is used only in a few places;
  namely in R601, R602, R701, R702, R540 (and their constraints).
  Thus, its not too hard to fix up.

  In 2.4.3.1

    [16:7-8] "subobject designators" -> "object designators"

    [16:12] "a subobject designator" -> "an object designator"

  In 2.5.1

    [18:4] "A <<subobject designator>>" -> "An <<object designator>>"
       And change the attached index entry correspondingly.

    [18:4] "one" -> "zero"

    [18:5+]  Add shaded note

        "An object name is a special case of an object designator."

  In 2.5.5

    [18:29] "data object name or data subobject designator"
             -> "data object designator"

    [18:33] "data object name, data subobject designator,"
             -> "data object designator"

    [18:34] Delete ", data subobject,"

  In 5.2.10

    [61:36] "name or designator" -> "designator"

       Note to J3: This constraint doesn't appear to explicitly
       mention the issue of subobjects.  One might argue that it
       is implcitly covered, but we were more explicit in
       comparable restrictions elsewhere.  I'm not going to follow
       up on this aspect; it is independent of my edit.

  In 6.0

    [73:2] "object name or subobject designator"
           -> "object designator"

    [73:5] "object name or subobject designator"
           -> "object designator"

    [73:7-14]  replace R601 and its constraints with

        "R601 <variable>    <<is>> <designator>

         Constraint:  <designator> shall not be a constant or
                      a subobject of a constant."

    [73:15] Replace the line with

       "R602 <designator>  <<is>> <object-name>

                           <<or>> <array-element>"

         Note to J3: The point of calling out scalar-variable-name
         and array-variable-name as separate cases elludes me.
         Likewise, I don't know why it was important to call out
         as a constraint that array-variable-name shall be the
         name of a data object that is an array, while it is not
         equally important to say that scalar-variable-name shall
         be the name of a data object that is a scalar.  Hmm, oh I
         see - 1.6.3 covers the scalar case, but not the array one;
         but we never need to make the distinction anyway.  After
         we go to all this trouble to mention array-variable-name,
         it is never used anywhere else in the document.

         Note to J3: And the "subobject of a constant" terminology
         is more like that used elsewhere, in addition to avoiding
         the issue of defining "parent".

  In 6.1.2

    [75:2-3] "a subobject designator" -> "an object designator"

  In 6.2

    [75:42-43] "name or designator" -> "designator"

  In 7.1.1.1

    [86:3-4]  replace the 2 lines with
              "<<or>> <designator>"

    [86:9-10] Delete these 2 lines.
    
  In 10.9

    [178:30] "object name or a subobject designator"
             -> "object designator"

  In 10.9.1.1

    [179:24] "subobject designators" -> "object designators"

    [179:44-45] "object name or subobject designator"
                -> "object designator"

  In Annex A

    [295:20-21] (definable) "<name> or <designator>"
                -> "designator"

    [295:35] (designator) "<subobject designator>"
             -> "<object designator>"

    [298:15] (named) "a subobject designator"
             -> "an <object designator>"

      Note to J3: Also fixes failure to italicize the term.

    [299:24] (reference) "a <data object name> or
             <subobject designator>" -> "an <object designator>"

    [300:23] (structure component) " that" -> ".  It"

      Note to J3: "that" would be wrong with the new terminology
      (and misleading with the old, implying that there are also
      parts of derived type objects that aren't components).

    [300:23-24] "<subobject designator>" -> "<object-designator>"

    [300:27] "<<subobject designator>>" -> "<<object designator>>"
       And, of course, realphabetize the entry.

    [300:27] (subobject designator) "one" -> "zero"

II. Other subobject fixes

  In 2.4.3.1

    [16:4]  Delete "named ".

      Note to J3: We define subobjects of unnamed character
      strings also.  Note 6.3 even has an example of such.  The
      restriction to named objects doesn't appear to have any
      useful function anyway.  As best as I can tell, it was just
      an (incorrect) observation that all the cases defined
      happened to apply only to named objects.

    [16:6]  After "(substrings), " add "portions of complex
            objects (real and imaginary parts), "

    [16:8] After "designators" add " or intrinsic functions"

    [16:16+]  Add new paragraph
            "Subobjects of complex objects are referenced by
            intrinsic functions."

      Note to J3:  I'm shocked that section 14.7.1 was the only
      place that ever mentioned that the real and imaginary parts
      of a complex object are subobjects.  If we are going to
      say that (which makes sense), it would be good to have the
      definition of subobject correspond.  This does mean that we
      have one form of subobject that cannot be referenced by a
      designator, but I suppose that's ok.  Anyway, if we aren't
      going to include the parts of a complex object as subobjects,
      then we shouldn't refer to them that way in 14.7.1.

  In 5.1.2.8

    [57:19+]  Add as a new paragraph.

       "If an object has the TARGET attribute, then all of its
        nonpointer subobjects also have the TARGET attribute."

    [57:24+]  Add a new shaded note

       "Every object designator that starts from a target object
        will have either the TARGET or POINTER attribute.  If
        pointers are involved, the designator might not
        necessarily be a subobject of the original target object,
        but since pointers may point only to targets, there is no
        way to end up at a nonpointer that is not a target."

        Note to J3:  This seems like a better place to treat this
        than trying to cover it separately for each kind of
        subobject.  And this way, we don't forget to mention it for
        some kinds of subobjects.  F95 forgets to say this about
        substrings and the real and imaginary parts of complex
        objects.  Also, this wording avoids the necessity to talk
        about the term "parent object", which can be tricky in the
        presense of pointers.

  In 5.1.2.3

    [53:13-14] "A dummy argument withh the INTENT(IN) attribute, or
                a subobject of such a dummy argument,"
                -> "An object with the INTENT(IN) attribute"

    [53:44+] Add new paragraph

       "If an object has an INTENT attribute, then all of its
        subobjects have the same INTENT attribute.

         BEGIN NOTE

         If a dummy argument is a derived type with a pointer
         component, the pointer as a pointer is a subobject of the
         dummy argument, but the target of the pointer is not.
         Therefore, the restrictions on subobjects of the dummy
         object apply to the pointer in contexts where it is used
         as a pointer, but not in contexts where it is
         dereferenced to indicate its target.  For example, if X
         is a dummy argument of derived type with an integer
         pointer component P, and X has INTENT(IN), then the
         statement

             X%P => NEW_TARGET

         is prohibited, but

             X%P = 0

         is allowed (provided that X%P is associated with a definable
         target).

         END NOTE"

    Note to J3: The exact meaning of the INTENT restrictions in the
    presense of pointers was unclear in f95.  Even without intent for
    pointer args, we need to address it because there are still
    pointer components.  The interpretation I've proposed in the
    note above is consistent with what we voted to do with intent
    for pointer args.  If we have any interpretation *OTHER* than
    something pretty close to the above, then I think its going to
    be hard to explain why intent for pointer args is different.

  In 5.2.10

    [61:16] "object or subobject" -> "object"

       Note to J3: The original "or subobject" added no semantic
       content.  I think it was probably trying to say something,
       but failed due to confusion of antecedents.  I can't
       actually tell for sure what the original is saying.  It
       could be trying to say that if a type has default
       initialization of even one component (or subcomponent),
       then no non-pointer object of that type can appear in a
       data-stmt-object-list.  But you can have subobjects of such
       objects, as long as the subobjects are the components
       without default initialization.  I could also make some
       other interpretations.  Sounds to me like an interp
       question.  The one thing I'm sure of is that the "or
       subobject" adds no semantic content as currently phrased;
       all it does is make one suspicious that perhaps it was
       supposed to mean something.

    [61:41-42] "subobject of a pointer"
               -> "object designator in which a pointer appears other
               than as the entire rightmost <part-ref>"

    [62:4] "shall not have a constant parent" -> "shall be a variable"

    [62:5] "shall not have a constant parent" -> "shall be a variable"

      Note to J3: These forms avoid the complications of defining
      the parent.  Let the definition of variable handle that one one
      place.

  In 5.5.1

    [66:40]  After "shall not be", add
       "a designator with a base object that is "

    [66:41]  Delete " sequence".

        Note to J3: This usage was overly complicated and confusing.
        The restriction certainly applies regardless of whether the
        derived type is sequence or not.  Apparently the sequence
        qualification was added here because non-sequence derived
        types are disallowed on other grounds.  But the items in
        this list are not exclusive, and it just confuses things
        to try to make them so.  For example, it would have made
        just as much sense to say "a non-allocatable object of
        derived type containing a pointer at any level..." because
        allocatable objects were separately covered.  In cases like
        this, it is better to state the restrictions in general
        form and recognize that a particular object might be
        disallowed for more than one of the reasons.

    [66:44] Add "or " before "a named constant"

    [66:44] Delete "a structure component, or a subobject of any of
                    the preceding objects"

    [66:44+] Add new constraint

        "Constraint: An <equivalence-object> shall not be a
         designator that has more than one <part-ref>."

        Note to J3:  This substitutes for the structure component
        restriction in the original; this one can't be phrased just
        in terms of the base object.

  In 6.1.2

    [75:16] "<<parent object>>" -> "<<base object>>"

      The term "parent object" was used only a few places, and many
      of those were wrong or misleading.  Several of them assumed
      that a data-ref always was a subobject of the parent, which
      simply was not true; I've fixed all of those to use "subobject"
      terminology.  For the remaining few uses, where this definition
      is appropriate, I've changed the term to "base object", which
      I think has less danger of incorrectly implying a subobject
      relationship.  As defined here, "base object" relates only to
      the syntax used in an object designator.

    [75:22] "parent" -> "base"

    [75:22-23] Delete the sentence that spans these lines.
      See the note about the edit at [76:39-40] for explanation.

  In 6.2.2

    [76:39-40] Replace the sentence with

      "An array element or an array section never has the POINTER
       attribute."

      Note to J3: Everything else that was here is now said in
      sections 5.1.2.3 and 5.1.2.8....except for those things that
      were said here that were wrong.  The old statement was not
      true in general for the PARAMETER attribute (namely, if the
      subscripts were variables).  But I don't think we ever
      needed the statement anyway for the PARAMETER attribute; I
      think we have words allowing appropriately restricted
      "subobjects of constants" wherever it comes up.  If we do
      need the statement here, then we need to rewrite it so that
      it is correct.  The old wording also was at best questionable
      (and likely just wrong) in its identification of the applicable
      "parent" in the presence of pointers.

  In 6.3.1

    [79:39-41]  replace the whole paragraph with

                "An <allocate-object> shall not depend on the value,
                 bounds, allocation status, or association status of
                 any other <allocate-object> in the same ALLOCATE
                 statement.

                 A bound shall not depend on the <stat-variable>
                 or on the value, bounds, alocation status, or
                 association status of any <allocate-object> in
                 the same ALLOCATE statement."

      Note to J3: Lets use the same kind of wording here as used
      for similar restrictions elsewhere in section 6.3.  That
      is, instead of restricting "stuff" from appearing in a
      bound, we restrict the bound from depending on "stuff".  Its
      just the same restriction from the other viewpoint.  Either
      viewpoint can work, but doing all of the similar cases the
      same way helps get them right.  Indeed, it looks like the
      original here did miss things.  It restricts the bounds from
      depending on other allocate objects, but it fails to
      restrict an allocate object from depending on another allocate
      object.  That is, it appears to allow
               type mytype
                 real, pointer :: a
               end type
               type(my_type), pointer :: p
               ...
               allocate(p,p%a)
      My edit fixes this.

    [80:5-6] Delete "or subobject of an <allocate-object>"

      Note to J3: A subobject of an allocate object depends on the
      association status or allocation status of the allocate object,
      so the explicit mention of subobject is unnecessary.  If we
      did feel the need to keep it, we'd need to make it right in
      that it certainly is intended to also cover things that aren't
      subobjects (because of pointers).  Same comment applies to
      the compatable edits below in 6.3.2 and 6.3.3.

      If we feel that something more explicit is needed, I'd prefer
      to add a separate statement somewhere to the effect that a
      dependence on a subobject constitutes a dependence on its
      parent (that's probably not quite the right words) instead
      of trying to get it all into this one sentence (and then
      repeating it several times).

    [80:6] "allocated in the same statement"
           -> "in the same ALLOCATE statement"

      Note to J3: Just for consistency in wording.

    [80:1-3] Move note 6.13 to [80:6+].  It seems out of place in
      the middle of the restrictions; goes better after them all.

  In 6.3.2

    [82:15] Delete ", or subobject of another pointer-object,"

       Note to J3: Also gets rid of the inconsistent comma usage.

  In 6.3.3

    [82:22] Delete "or subobject of another allocate-object"

       Note to J3: Also gets rid of a typo failure to italicize.

    [82:25-26] Delete "or subobject of an allocate-object"

  In 7.1.6.2

    [95:23-28] replace these lines with

      "(2) An obect designator with a base object that is a dummy
           argument that has neither the OPTIONAL nor the
           INTENT(OUT) attribute,

       (3) An object designator with a base object that is in a
           common block,

       (4) An object designator with a base object that is made
           accessible by use or host association,

  7.5.1.5

    [110:8] Delete "parent ".

      Note to J3:  The term "parent" was superfluous here, and its
      definition was vague.

  7.5.2

    [110:43-44] Change this constraint to read
                "The <variable> shall have either the TARGET or
                 POINTER attribute."

      Note to J3: The subobject stuff was superfluous.  A
      subobject of something with the TARGET attribute either also
      has the TARGET attribute or is a POINTER.  The only case
      where this hadn't previously been made explicit was for
      substrings, which we fixed in an edit above.  Furthermore,
      by the use of the term "subobject" here was confusing because
      it was presumably intended to refer also to things that were
      not, in fact, subobjects (because of pointers).

  In 7.5.4.4

    [119:2] Delete "or subobject"

      Note to J3: I never have been able to deduce what this
      sentence actually says; I can't parse it sensibly.  But
      whatever it does or doesn't mean can't be changed by
      deleting "or subobject" because a subobject is an object.

  In 9.3

    [138:16-18]  Delete the paragraph.

      Note to J3: This paragraph was oddly inconsistent.  Why did
      we mention subobjects for allocatable arrays, but fail to
      mention subobjects for pointers in the imediately preceding
      sentence?  The whole paragraph is superfluous anyway.  It is
      just one case of the far more general rules that pointers
      are required to be associated in order to define them
      (5.1.2.7) and allocatable arrays are required to be
      allocated in order to define them (6.3.1.2).  There are
      bazillions of places in section 9 alone where we could state
      a comparable specific case; why is it stated only for this
      one?  For example, we don't specifically say that an
      allocatable array in an input list must be allocated.  And
      we don't say that if the <variable> in an assignment statement
      is allocatable, it must be allocated.  It seems really out of
      place to say it here, but nowhere else.  Makes it seem like
      there is something special about its application here; if there
      is anything so special, it certainly escapes me.

  In 12.4.1.5

    [203:9] "A subobject it it"
            -> "A designator with it as the base object and with at
            least one subobject selector"

  In 12.4.1.6

    [203:26] Delete the line and renumber.

    [205:9] Delete the line and renumber.

       Note to J3: If the dummy has a pointer component, the target
       of the pointer is not a "part" of the dummy, so these
       exceptions are superfluous.  See also edits in 5.1.2.3

  In 12.5.4

    [211:28]  Delete "parent "

  In 12.7.1

    [214:3] "A dummy argument, or a subobject thereof,"
            -> "An object designator with a dummy argument as the
                base object"

  In 14.6.3.3

    [288:4]  Delete "or subobjects"

       Note to J3: Added no content since a subobject is an object.

  In Annex A

    [300:25] (subobject) Delete "<named >".

    [300:26] "or a substring" -> "a substring, or the real or imaginary
             part of a complex object"

    [300:43] (target) Add "nonpointer " before "<subobject>".
