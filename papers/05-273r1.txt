1. Requirement:
---------------

Provide a method to indicate that the target of a pointer or a dummy argument
is contiguous.  Specifying an assumed-shape dummy argument to be contiguous
shall not require the actual argument to be contiguous.


2. Detailed Specification:
--------------------------

The CONTIGUOUS attribute specifies that a pointer shall only be associated with
a contiguous object, or that an assumed-shape array is contiguous.

If a non-contiguous actual argument is associated with an assumed-shape array
with the CONTIGUOUS attribute, the dummy is nonetheless contiguous; the
processor shall make a copy if necessary.

An entity may be known at compile time to be contiguous, however such an entity
does not have the CONTIGUOUS attribute, and the CONTIGUOUS attribute shall not
be specified for it.

An object is (runtime) contiguous if it is zero-size, a scalar, or an array with
its elements occupying consecutive memory locations in array element order.

A means to test for runtime contiguity shall be provided; this can be used to
avoid attempting an invalid pointer assignment (of a CONTIGUOUS pointer to a
non-contiguous target).

Integration: Allow rank remapping to take a contiguous array (currently it is
 limited to rank one arrays, only to avoid difficulties with non-unit stride).

3. Syntax:
----------

The CONTIGUOUS attribute can be used in component declaration statements
and type declaration statements.  The entity being declared shall be a
pointer or assumed-shape array.

A pointer with the CONTIGUOUS attribute shall only be pointer-associated with a
contiguous target.  An assumed-shape dummy array is contiguous whether the
actual argument is contiguous or not.

The CONTIGUOUS statement may also be used to give the attribute to a variable.

Examples:
      real, contiguous, dimension(:,:) :: d
      type t
        real, pointer, contiguous        :: sptr(:)
      end type
      contiguous :: dummy

The intrinsic function IS_CONTIGUOUS(A) returns the .TRUE. if and only if
A is contiguous.

4. Edits:
---------

[xiii] Introduction, the list of new Fortran 2008 features should include
       "Performance enhancements: CONTIGUOUS attribute."

In section 1.6 Compatibility, there are no changes needed.

[50:7+] In the list of allowed <component-attr-spec> (R441) add:
     "<<or>> CONTIGUOUS"

[50:31+] Add a new constraint:

C443a (R440) If the CONTIGUOUS attribute is specified, the component shall be
      an array with the POINTER attribute.

[71:20+] In the list of allowed <attr-spec> (R503) add:
     "<<or>> CONTIGUOUS"

[72:29+] Add new constraint:
 "C512a (R501) An entity that has the CONTIGUOUS attribute shall be an array
        pointer or an assumed-shape array."

[78:2-] Add a new subsection:

 "5.1.2.4a  CONTIGUOUS attribute

  The <<CONTIGUOUS attribute>> specifies that an entity is contiguous.

  An object is <<contiguous>> if it is not the real or imaginary part of an
  array of type complex, and is:
    (1) an object with the CONTIGUOUS attribute,
    (2) a scalar object,
    (3) a nonpointer array that is not assumed-shape,
    (4) an array allocated by an ALLOCATE statement,
    (5) an assumed-shape array that is argument associated with an array
        that is contiguous,
    (6) a pointer associated with a contiguous target,
    (7) an array with at most one element, or
    (8) an non-zero sized array section (6.2.2) with the following
        properties:
          (a) Its base object is contiguous.
          (b) It does not have a vector subscript.
          (c) The elements of the section, in array section order, are a subset
              of the base object elements that are consecutive in array element
              order.
          (d) If the array is of type character and a <substring-range>
              appears, the <substring-range> specifies all of the
              characters of the <parent-string> (6.1.1).
          (e) Only its final <part-ref> has nonzero rank.

  An object is not contiguous if it is an array subobject, and
   (1) the object has two or more elements,
   (2) the elements of the object in array element order are not consecutive in
       the elements of the base object,
   (3) the object is not of type character with length zero, and
   (4) the object is not of a derived type that has no ultimate components
       other than zero-sized arrays and characters with length zero.

  It is processor-dependent whether any other object is contiguous.

  Note 5.10a

  If a derived type has only one component that is not zero-sized, it is
  processor-dependent whether a structure component of a contiguous array of
  that type is contiguous. If each of the elements of an array occupies no
  storage, it is processor-dependent whether a section of that array with
  non-unit stride is contiguous.

  [end Note]

  Note 5.10b

  The CONTIGUOUS attribute allows a processor to enable optimizations that
  depend on the memory layout of the object occupying a contiguous block
  of memory.  Examples of CONTIGUOUS attribute specifications are:

   REAL, POINTER, CONTIGUOUS        :: SPTR(:)
   REAL, CONTIGUOUS, DIMENSION(:,:) :: D

   [end Note]"

[87:12+] Add a new subsection:
 "5.2.4a  CONTIGUOUS statement

  R523a  <contiguous-stmt>  is  CONTIGUOUS [::] <object-name-list>

  The CONTIGUOUS statement specifies the CONTIGUOUS attribute  (5.1.2.4a)
  for a list of objects."

In 7.4.2, Pointer assignment
[143:21] in C720, change "is specified...otherwise" to
   "is not specified:

[144:25+] Add new paragraph
 "If <data-pointer-object> has the CONTIGUOUS attribute, <data-target> shall
  be contiguous."
{Pointer assignment.}

In 7.4.2.1, Data pointer assignment
[144:26] In the first line of the penultimate para of the section, before
         "shall", insert
  "shall be contiguous ([xref to the definition of contiguous])
   or of rank one. It"

In 7.4.2.3, Examples
[145:First line of Note 7.44] Change
   "high-rank views of (parts of) rank-one objects" to
   "different-rank views of parts of an object"

[145:Second line of Note 7.44] Insert the sentence
   "This requires that the object be either rank one or
    contiguous." After the first sentence of the note.

[161:19] Before "TARGET, or VOLATILE" insert "CONTIGUOUS,".
{Propagate the attribute into ASSOCIATE/SELECTTYPE.}

[256:28] Change "VALUE(...), ASYNCHRONOUS(...),"
  to "ASYNCHRONOUS(5.1.2.3), CONTIGUOUS(5.1.2.3a), VALUE(5.1.2.15),"
{The characteristics of a dummy data object need to include its contiguity
 requirement.}

[257:3] After "whether it is a pointer," insert
 "whether it has the CONTIGUOUS attribute,".
{Needed here too.}

[269:15] Before "If a dummy argument is allocatable" insert
 "If a dummy argument has the CONTIGUOUS attribute, the actual argument shall
  have the CONTIGUOUS attribute."
{So that contiguous pointers are not required to be the same as noncontig ones.}

[270:5-6] Replace "either a scalar or an assumed-shape array" with
 "either a scalar or an assumed-shape array that does not have the
  CONTIGUOUS attribute."

[271:8,11] After "shall be an assumed-shape array" insert
 "that does not have the CONTIGUOUS attribute".
{VOLATILE/ASYNCHRONOUS isn't going to work if we make it do a copy.}

[296:15+] Add a new function to the list in 13.5.8 of Other inquiry
          functions:
 "IS_CONTIGUOUS(A)     Contiguity inquiry"

[325:7+] Add a description for a new intrinsic function:
 "13.7.56a  IS_CONTIGUOUS(A)

  Description. Determine whether an object is contiguous (5.1.2.4a).

  Class. Inquiry function.

[416:24] Append new sentence to the last item (number 8),
 "A pointer that has the CONTIGUOUS attribute occupies a storage unit that is
  different from that of a pointer that does not have the CONTIGUOUS
  attribute."
{So that contiguous pointers are not required to be the same as noncontig ones.}
