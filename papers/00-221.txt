To:	WG5
From:	Tony Warnock, J3 Chair
Subject:	Fortran 2000 Status Report

* J3 has continued working on the standard.
* As requested by WG5, J3 is devoting resources towards interpretation processing. 
* As requested by WG5, J3 will implement dynamic type allocations, a generalized constructor, an implicit root type, and the WITH-like construct.
* Current resource processing: 1/3 effort on interpretation processing, 1/3 effort on OOP, and 1/3 effort on interoperability with C.
* J3 has both gained and lost members this year. While the total number of members is about the same, the expertise of the retiring members will be missed.

Fortran 2000 Workplan Status Report

The base for Fortran 2000 is Fortran 95. J3 will integrate the material the following "R" and "T" items (and any "M" items that are finished in time) into the Fortran 95 standard to prepare the Fortran 2000 draft standard. J3 will deliver this draft document to WG5 in 2003.
