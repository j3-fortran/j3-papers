Subject: Recommendation for US18 "Allow Polymorphism in Coarrays"
Date: 2026-February-16
References: WG5-N2249, 23-217

1. Introduction
============

23-217 ("Usable Polymorphism in Coarrays") proposed relaxing several
constraints to enable more usable polymorphism with coindexed objects in
coarrays. It appears as accepted work item US18 in N2249 (Jun 2025) for the
upcoming Standard, but was first accepted in N2234 (Jun 2024).  Since its
submission, interest has waned and the anticipated complexity of an
implementation has increased.

2. Subgroup Recommendation
=========================

Given the lack of interest and progress, the J3 HPC subgroup recommends that
item US18 be removed (without prejudice) from the Fortran 202Y work list. The
item may be reconsidered in the future if and when a subgroup or individual
accepts ownership and a stronger set of motivating examples to justify the
expected implementation burden.

3. Resolution
===========
In passing this paper, INCITS/Fortran (J3) recommends to WG5 that work item
US18 be removed from the work list for Fortran 202Y.
