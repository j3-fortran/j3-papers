Subject: F03/0096 Can a read statement change the unit value?
Date: 2011 October 13

NUMBER: F03/0096
TITLE: Can a read statement change the unit value?
KEYWORDS: Read statement, unit value
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 Consideration in Progress

QUESTION:

Is it allowed to change the value of a variable which supplies the
unit number to a read statement?

10-007 [243:3-5] says the value of any input/output specifier shall not
depend on any input-item.  UNIT= is a specifier in a READ statement.

Note 9.40 on page 221 gives the example

         READ(N)  N, X(N)

and discusses how the changes to N work.

ANSWER:

Yes, the example was intended to be allowed as long as N is not an
internal unit.  Edits will limit the restriction to "output items"
in the specifier list and the Format.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

In 9.12, paragraph 5,
[243:3-4]
  Delete "on any <input-item>, <io-implied-do> <do-variable>, or",
  Making that sentence read:
    "The value of a specifier in an input/output statement shall not
     depend on the definition or evaluation of any other specifier in
     the <io-control-spec-list> or <inquire-spec-list> in that
     statement."
[243:5] Append new sentence to paragraph
  "The value of an <internal-file-variable> or of a FMT=, ID=, IOMSG=,
   IOSTAT= or SIZE= specifier shall not be defined or redefined by
   the value assigned to any <input-item> or
   to an <io-implied-do> <do-variable> in that statement."
