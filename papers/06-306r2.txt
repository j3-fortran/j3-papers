Subject: Comments on Clause 12 
Reference: J3/06-007r1

Discussion

296:9-10 Overlooks internal procedures.

312:3-4 Conflicts with 12.5.2.3: 12.5.2.3 says "if a nonoptional
nonpointer dummy argument corresponds to a pointer actual argument,
the actual argument shall be pointer associated with a target and the
dummy argument becomes argument associated with that target" and "A
present nonpointer dummy argument that corresponds to a nonpointer
actual argument becomes argument associated with that actual
argument." [312:3-4] says "If the dummy argument has the VALUE
attribute it becomes associated with a definable anonymous data
object. . . ." No matter whether the actual argument has the pointer
attribute, 12.5.2.3 conflicts with [12:3-4].

Question without edits

318:5-10 [We allow automatic "pointering" of INTENT(IN) pointer dummy
variables to nonpointer actual arguments and automatic dereferencing
of nonpointer dummy variables associated with pointer actual
arguments. It appears we don't allow the same for pointer
arguments. Did we intend this asymmetry?]

Proposed answer: No, we did not intend this asymmetry. Edits are
provided to correct this oversight.

Edits to J3/06-007r1:

[296:9] Change "an external procedure, module" to "an external procedure,
internal procedure, module".

[311:2] Insert "that does not have the VALUE attribute" after "dummy
argument"

[311:6] Insert "that does not have the VALUE attribute" after "dummy
argument"

[311:10+] Insert a new paragraph: "If a present dummy argument has
the VALUE attribute it becomes argument associated with a definable
anonymous data object. If the dummy argument corresponds to a
nonpointer actual argument the initial value of the data ob ject is
the value of the actual argument. If the dummy argument corresponds to
a pointer actual argument that pointer shall be pointer associated
with a target and the initial value of the data object is the value of
that target."

[312:3-5] Delete. 

[318:5] Before ", the associated actual argument" insert "and does
not have the INTENT(IN) attribute."

[318:6] Add two new sentences at the end of the paragraph: "Otherwise,
if the dummy aegument is a procedure pointer with the INTENT(IN)
attribute, the associated actual argument shall be a procedure
pointer, a reference to a function that returns a procedure pointer, a
reference to the NULL intrinsic function, or a valid target for the
dummy pointer in an assignment statement. If the actual argument is
not a pointer, the dummy pointer becomes pointer-associated with the
actual argument."

[333:2] Replace "or" by a comma, then insert ", or
<end-mp-subprogram-stmt> " after "<end-subroutine-stmt>".
