Discussion:

UTI 167 notes inconsistent and unclear wording in Note 8.32. The term
"permanent memory location" should be used consistently. The actions
of atomic memory operations should not be deferred to a later point in
the segment as is described in the previous paragraph for non-atomic
actions.

------------

Edits to 09-007r2:

[189:Note 8.32] In the penultimate Note of "8.5.2 Segments" make the
following changes:

In the first sentence of the second paragraph, replace "permanent
location" with "permanent memory location".

Replace the third (last) paragraph with:

"The value of the ATOM argument of an atomic subroutine might be
accessed or modified by another concurrently executing
image. Therefore, execution of an atomic subroutine that references
the ATOM argument cannot rely on a local copy, but instead always gets
its value from its permanent memory location.  Execution of an atomic
subroutine that defines the ATOM argument does not complete until the
value of its ATOM argument is accessible from its permanent memory
location by all other images."
