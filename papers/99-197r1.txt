Subject: Interface Scoping Problem

This paper is basically a revision of ISO/IEC JTC1/SC22/WG5/N1365.

1. The problem in F90/F95

   MODULE M
     TYPE T
       PRIVATE
       ...
     END TYPE
   CONTAINS
     SUBROUTINE SUB(X,F)
       TYPE(T) X(10)
       INTERFACE
         TYPE(T) FUNCTION F()           ! Oops
           DIMENSION F(10)
         END
       END INTERFACE
       X = F()
     END SUBROUTINE
   END

   i.e. A module procedure inside the module that defines an "opaque" type
   cannot have a dummy procedure that has an argument of that type (assuming
   that an explicit interface is required for the dummy function).

2. The problem in F200x

   ... obstructs the use of certain O.O. constructs.

   MODULE M
     TYPE T
       PROCEDURE(xyz),PASS_OBJ,POINTER :: p     ! (Alpha)
     CONTAINS
       PROCEDURE,PASS_OBJ :: x => mpx
       PROCEDURE(xyz),PASS_OBJ :: y => NULL()   ! (Beta)
     END TYPE
     ...
     INTERFACE PROCEDURE()
       SUBROUTINE xyz(obj)
         CLASS(T) obj                ! Oops
       END SUBROUTINE
     END INTERFACE
     ...
   CONTAINS
     SUBROUTINE mpx(obj)
       CLASS(T) obj                  ! ok
       ...
     END SUBROUTINE
   END

   The problem is that the "PROCEDURE(xyz)" requires the abstract interface to
   be defined in the same module, but the interface cannot access the type T
   which it needs to declare the dummy arguments.

   This applies to any procedure pointer (or deferred type-bound procedure)
   that has a dummy argument of the type, not only to PASS_OBJ procedures.

   "Beta" can be simulated by the user - by providing a stub procedure instead
   of a NULL() - but "Alpha" cannot be done in that way.

3. The Proposal: Specification

   There should be a means of accessing host entities from an interface body.
   Only explicitly named entities are to be accessed, from the enclosing
   scoping unit.

   In particular, the IMPLICIT mapping is not accessed.  If there are no
   IMPLICIT statements in the interface body then the implicit mappings in
   use will continue to be the normal Fortran default mappings.

4. Syntax Possibilities

4.1 Option 1: The IMPORT statement.

   Syntax: IMPORT [::] <import-name-list>

           Constraint: <import-name> shall be a derived-type name or a named
                       constant.

   e.g.  IMPORT mytype,yourtype

   Thus to fix up the example in section 2 above, the user would put "IMPORT T"
   immediately before the line containing "Oops".

   Details:

   The named entities must be entities defined in or accessible in the
   enclosing scope.  No further declaration of such entities is permissible.
   Entities defined in the enclosing scope must have been declared prior to
   the interface body.  Note that importing anything other than a TYPE or
   PARAMETER has some small useful functionality so this is allowed.

   The IMPORT statement would only be allowed in interface bodies and would
   appear after any USE statements and before any IMPLICIT statement.

   It is not considered to be useful to be able to rename entities in this
   limited context, so a simple <name-list> is thought to be adequate.

4.2 Option 2: Extend the USE statement.

   Syntax: USE *, ONLY: [<only-list>]

   e.g.  USE *,ONLY:mytype,yourtype

   Thus to fix up the example in section 2 above, the user would put
   "USE *,ONLY:T" immediately before the line containing "Oops".

   Details:

   As per the IMPORT statement, but for consistency we would allow renaming.

4.3 Option 3: Allow some recursive USE statements.

   Syntax: Allow an interface body in a module to contain a USE statement for
           that module.

   Thus to fix up the example in section 2 above, the user would put
   "USE M,ONLY:T" immediately before the line containing "Oops".

   Details:

   To prevent the possibility of recursive definitions the ONLY clause must
   be present.

   Otherwise the details are the same as in option 2.

5. Syntax

   After discussion a straw vote to choose between these options resulted in
      Prefer option (i):  10
      Prefer option (ii):  0
      Prefer option (iii): 0
      Undecided:           1

   Therefore this paper proposes the syntax of the IMPORT statement as
   described in option (i) above.
