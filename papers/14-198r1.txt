Subject: Edits for 60559 Conformance
Date: 2014 June 26


1. Introduction

This paper contains edits for making Fortran 2015 conformant with
ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011.

Early background discussion was in 13-356r1.
The specifications and syntax are in 14-196.

The specification features are all labelled with a letter.  Where possible,
the edits to implement each specific feature are labelled with that letter.


2. Edits to 14-007r1/N2014

[throughout] "IEC 60559:1989" -> "ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011".
{via macros \IEEEstd et al.}

[intro] describe this feature.

[247:8+] 10.3.2 Edit descriptors, R1007 <data-edit-desc>,
         After "<<or>> ES ..."
         insert "<<or>> EX <w> . <d> [ E <e> ]".
[247:19] 10.3.2 Edit descriptors, C1006 "<e> shall be positive."
  replace with
    "C1006 (R1011) <e> shall be zero or positive for the EX edit
           descriptor.  <e> shall be positive for all other edit
           descriptors.".
[247:20] 10.3.2 Edit descriptors, C1007 "<w> shall be zero..."
         after "ES," insert "EX,".
[247:26] 10.3.2 Edit descriptors, p2,
         after "ES," insert "EX,".
{feature (n).}

[251:3,6,12,18,22] 10.7.2.1 General rules, p1,
                   Opening sentence, after "ES," insert "EX,",
                   Item (1), after "not an IEEE exceptional specification"
                   insert "or hexadecimal-significand number",
                   Item (3), after "ES," insert "EX,".
                   Item (5), after "ES," insert "EX,",
                   Item (6), after "ES," insert "EX,".
{feature (n).}

[252:12] 10.7.2.3.2 F editing, p3,
         "an IEEE exceptional specification or"
         ->"an IEEE exceptional specification, a hexadecimal-significand
            number, or".
[252:31+] 10.7.2.3.2 F editing, after p6 "The value specified by 'INF'...",
  Insert new paragraph
    "An input field that is a hexadecimal-significand number consists of an
     optional sign, followed by the hexadecimal indicator which is the
     digit 0 immediately followed by the letter X, followed by a
     hexadecimal significand followed by a hexadecimal exponent.  A
     hexadecimal significand is a string of one or more hexadecimal
     characters optionally containing a decimal symbol.  The decimal symbol
     indicates the position of the hexadecimal point; if no decimal symbol
     appears, the hexadecimal point implicitly follows the last hexadecimal
     symbol.  A hexadecimal exponent is the letter P followed by a
     (decimal) <signed-digit-string>.  Embedded blanks are not permitted in
     a hexadecimal-significand number.  The value is equal to the
     significand multiplied by two raised to the power of the exponent,
     negated if the optional sign is minus.".
{feature (n).  The explicit statement of where the hexadecimal point
 appears means the scale factor is ignored.}

[255:12-] Immediately before 10.7.2.3.6 Complex editing, insert
  "10.7.2.3.5a EX editing

   The EX<w>.<d> and EX<w>.<d> E<e> edit descriptors indicate that the
   external field occupies <w> positions, except when <w> is zero in which
   case the processor selects the field width.  The fractional part of the
   field contains <d> hexadecimal digits, except when <d> is zero in which
   case the processor selects the number of hexadecimal digits to be the
   minimum required so that the output field is equal to the internal
   value; <d> shall not be zero if the radix of the internal value is not a
   power of two.  The hexadecimal point, represented by a decimal symbol,
   appears after the first hexadecimal digit.  For the form EX<w>.<d>, and
   for EX<w>.<d>E0, the exponent part contains the minimum number of digits
   needed to represent the exponent; otherwise the exponent contains <e>
   digits.  The <e> has no effect on input.  The scale factor has no effect
   on output.

   The form and interpretation of the input field is the same as for
   F<w>.<d> editing (10.7.2.3.2).

   For an internal value that is an IEEE infinity or NaN, the form of the
   output field is the same as for F<w>.<d>.

   For an internal value that is neither an IEEE infinity nor a NaN, the
   form of the output field for a scale factor of zero is
     [ \plusminus ] x_0 \dot x_1 x_2 ... <exp>
   where:
     - \plusminus signifies a plus sign or a minus sign;
     - \dot signifies a decimal symbol (10.6) indicating the hexadecimal
       point;
     - x_0 x_1 ... are the most significant hexadecimal digits of the
       internal value, after rounding if <d> is not zero (10.7.2.3.7);
     - <exp> is a binary exponent expressed as a decimal integer; for
       EX<w>.<d> and EX<w>.<d>E0, the form is P \plusminus z_1 ... z_n,
       where <n> is the minimum number of digits needed to represent <exp>,
       and for EX<w>.<d>E<e> with <e> greater than zero the form is
       P \plusminus z_1 ... z_e.

   The sign in the exponent is produced.  A plus sign is produced if the
   exponent value is zero.

   NOTE 10.nn
   Examples:

     Internal Value   Edit Descriptor   Output Field
        1.375          EX0.2             0X1.6P+0

        1.04858e+06    EX0.0             0X1.00003P+20".
{feature (n).}

[406:9,12] 14.1 General, p4 (beginning "Additional"),
  "or IEEE_SQRT" -> "IEEE_SQRT, or IEEE_SUBNORMAL",
  Append to paragraph
    "Note that the effect of IEEE_DENORMAL is the same as that of
     IEEE_SUBNORMAL."
{feature (a).}

[406:11] ditto,
         "shall return true for all the"
         ->"shall return true for the".
{feature (c).}
OPTIONAL EXTRA EDIT:
[406:12] ditto,
         after "and IEEE_DOWN"
         insert
           "; support for IEEE_AWAY is also required if there is at least
            one kind of real X for which IEEE_SUPPORT_DATATYPE (X) is true
            and RADIX (X) is equal to ten.".
{feature (c).}

[406:27+] 14.2 Derived types and constants defined in the modules, p2,
  Add new bullet:
    " - IEEE_MODES_TYPE is for representing the floating-point modes."
{feature (u).}

[406:32-34] 14.2 Derived types and constants defined in the modules, p3,
  "_DENORMAL" -> "_SUBNORMAL", TWICE (within names),
  Append
    "The named constants IEEE_NEGATIVE_DENORMAL and IEEE_POSITIVE_DENORMAL
     are defined with the same value as IEEE_NEGATIVE_SUBNORMAL and
     IEEE_POSITIVE_SUBNORMAL respectively.".
{feature (a).}

[406:36-37] 14.2 Derived types and constants defined in the modules, p3,
            "and IEEE_DOWN" -> "IEEE_DOWN, and IEEE_AWAY",
            "for the IEEE modes"
            ->"for the rounding modes specified in ISO/IEC/IEEE
               60559:2011".
{feature (c), plus reference the IEEE standard properly.}

[407:4] ditto, p4,
 Between "IEEE_SQRT," and "and IEEE_UNDERFLOW_FLAG"
 insert "IEEE_SUBNORMAL".
{feature (a).}

[407:20] 14.3 The exceptions, p1, IEEE_INVALID bullet, append
  "In a numeric relational operation $x_1$ \si{rel-op} $x_2$, if
   $x_1 + x_2$ is of type real and IEEE_SUPPORT_NAN ($x_1 + x_2$)
   is true, IEEE_INVALID shall signal as specified by ISO/IEC/IEEE
   60559:2011 for the compareSignaling{relation} operations; that is, if
   $x_1$ and $x_2$ are unordered.".
{feature (p).}

[408:23-] 14.4 The rounding modes, p1,
  Insert new first paragraph
    "ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011 specifies a binary rounding mode that affects
     floating-point arithmetic with radix 2, and a decimal rounding mode
     that affects floating-point arithmetic with radix 10.  Unqualified
     references to the rounding mode with respect to a particular
     arithmetic operation or operands refers to the mode for the radix of
     the operation or operands, and other unqualified references to the
     rounding mode refers to both binary and decimal rounding modes.".
{feature (t).  We will try to edit all the ambiguous unqualified references
 to be plural so there will be no ambiguity.}

[408:23-27+] 14.4 The rounding modes, p1,
             "four rounding modes." -> "five possible modes for rounding:",
             change "value." to "value;" four times,
             add new bullet
               "- IEEE_AWAY rounds the exact result away from zero to the
                  next representable value; ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011
                  requires this mode for decimal floating-point, but it is
                  optional for binary floating-point.".
{feature (c).  The witter is to help the reader understand why IEEE_AWAY
 support is less, much less, than the other rounding modes.  Also try to
 differentiate the rounding mode value from the rounding mode itself, via
 "possible modes for rounding"; helps with feature (t).}

[408:28-29] 14.4 The rounding modes, p2,
            (first) "rounding mode" -> "rounding modes",
            "rounding mode is" -> "rounding modes are".

            "alter it" -> "alter them".
{feature (t).}

[408:36] 14.4 The rounding modes, p4,
         "rounding mode on" -> "rounding modes on",
         "mode is the same as it was"->"modes are the same as they were".
{feature (t).}

[409:2] 14.5 Underflow mode, p1,
        "denormalized" -> "subnormal".
{feature (a).}

[409:21] 14.7 The floating-point status, heading,
         "status" -> "modes and status".
[409:22-23] 14.7 The floating-point status, p1,
         "The values of all ... are called the floating-point status."
         ->"The values of the rounding modes, underflow mode, and halting
            mode are collectively called the floating-point modes.  The
            values of all the supported flags for exceptions and the
            floating-point modes are collectively called the floating-point
            status.  The floating-point modes can be stored in a scalar
            variable of type IEEE_MODES_TYPE with the subroutine
            IEEE_GET_MODES and restored with the subroutine
            IEEE_SET_MODES."
{feature (u).}

[409:22] 14.7 The floating-point status, p1,
         "rounding mode" -> "rounding modes".
{feature (t), this is independent from the feature (u) edit above.}

[409:25-29] 14.7 The floating-point [modes and] status, p1,
            Delete "Portions of ... IEEE_SET_UNDERFLOW_MODE.".
{Delete unnecessary waffle rather than extend it with feature (u).}

[409:29+4-5] 14.7 The floating-point [modes and] status, NOTE 14.7,
             "flags in a floating-point status register"

             "much faster" -> "faster",
             "individual flags" -> "individual flags and modes".
{Editorial: generalise this to include the modes - often not individually
 settable, and water down the claim for efficiency to be more reasonable.}
