Subject:      Interpretation Request: Ability to Overload the
                                      Character Operator //

NUMBER:       3
TITLE:        Ability to overload the character operator //
KEYWORDS:     overload, intrinsic, //
DEFECT TYPE:  Interpretation 
STATUS:       X3J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

On page 89 of the Fortran 95 standard, the Note at the bottom of Table 7.1
states in part:

  For the intrinsic operators REQUIRING {emphasis not in standard} operands
  of type character, the kind type parameters of the operands shall be the
  same.

Since there is only one intrinsic operator (//) that REQUIRES its operands
to be of type character, one may conclude that the operands of the //
operator MUST be of type character and MUST have the same kind type parameters.

The last sentence of the first full paragraph on page 90 restates the above
rule for intrinsic uses of // as follows:

  For the character intrinsic operator //, the kind type parameters
  shall be the same.

Contrast this with the last sentence of the last paragraph of this section:

  A {character relational intrinsic operation} is a relational intrinsic
  operation where the operands are of type character and have the same
  kind type parameter value.

>From the wording of this last sentence, one may conclude that if the kind
type parameters are the same, then the relational operation is intrinsic but
if the kind type parameters are NOT the same, then the relational operation
is NOT intrinsic and must be defined via a user-provided function.  Thus, it
is possible for the character operands of a relational operator to have
differing kind type parameter values.

Now compare this to the following sentence from 7.1.4.2:

  For an expression <x1> // <x2> where <x1> and <x2> are of type character,
  the character length parameter is the sum of the lengths of the operands
  and the kind type parameter is the kind type parameter of <x1>, which
  shall be the same as the kind type parameter of <x2>.

Note that there is no text or title to indicate that the description is only
for intrinsic operators.  There appears to be no way to overload the //
symbol at all since the wording does not restrict the rule to the intrinsic
interpretation of the operator (it appears in fact from the wording that
once the operands are of type character, there can be no other interpretation
other than intrinsic).

This is surely not what was intended.  The wording should be redone to more
closely resemble that for the character relational operators such that if
the operands of // do not have the same kind type parameters, an overload
is allowed (and the operator is not interpreted as being intrinsic).

(See also 7.2.2 Character intrinsic operation.)

Suggested edits:

1. Delete the last sentence of the first full paragraph on page 90.

2. Add the following sentence to the last paragraph of 7.1.2:

     A {character concatenation intrinsic operation} is a concatenation
     operation where the operands are of type character and have the same
     kind type parameter value.

3. In the second sentence of the third paragraph of 7.1.4.2, insert "and  
   have the same kind type parameter value" ahead of the first comma.

him:

Subject: Re: Another f2k edit

I [also] noticed the difference in terminology ...  My reading is that the
difference is just sloppily inconsistent wording (which should be fixed for
f2k) rather than a real difference between concat and the char relationals.
I suspect that it is just the *intrinsic* concat that "requires" kind
agreement - if it doesn't hold, then you don't have the intrinsic concat,
but could still overload one.  In other words, even though the wording is
different, I think they are trying to say the same thing.  I certainly can't
think of any reason why they *should* be different.  But I haven't really
researched it - nor do I have time to right now.
