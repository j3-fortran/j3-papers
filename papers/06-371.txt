Page 440 describes the 5 IEEE types and says their components are
private.  I think UTI 90 (from page 436) should also apply to
these types.  Are the IEE types extensible, BIND(C), etc., do they
have CO_ARRAY components?

Since the problem occurs in 2 places, we should bite the bullet and
pass both problems on to clause 4.  Define some new type, maybe "basic
intrinsic derived type" and define them to have no interesting
attributes.  they aren't extensible, bind(c), co-arrayish....

This will make the wording easier when we define more standard
derived types.
