1. Introduction

Clause 13 makes unnecessary and frequently incorrect use of the verb
"to return".  These should be reworded.  (The incorrect uses are when
referring to subroutines - these do not return any value!)

In the particular case when these are in the function Descriptions, this
makes the grammar wrong; a function produces a result value, therefore
should always be a noun phrase - a verb clause should only be used for a
procedure that performs some visible action - and "return" does not qualify
for that either.  The usage in the descriptions of ATOMIC_DEFINE,
ATOMIC_REF and EXECUTE_COMMAND_LINE (what was it guilty of?) are proper
usages.

Some of the brief descriptions are unnecessarily long, resulting in poor
typesetting of Table 13.1; for example "Reduce array with bitwise AND
operation" splits "opera-tion" across 2 lines.  Also, some reductions are
"reduce by" and others are "reduce with"; "reduce by" is shorter so let's
use that.  As for bitwise AND, I would suggest either additionally dropping
the word operation, or changing it to "by the IAND function".  These
descriptions are just witter, so as long as we convey the intention and
avoid contradicting the full definition we are fine.

Also, the subscripting is typeset wrongly in NORM2; it has
$d_{\text{DIM-1}}$ where it should be $d_{\text{DIM}-1}$ like everywhere
else.

Note: some of the entries have more than one alternative, this leaves it
      up to the editor when applying the changes.

Note: FINDLOC has considerable internal problems and contradictions, which
      are not entirely fixed by this paper.


2. Edits to 10-007r1

[319:8+4] 13.5 Standard generic intrinsic procedures, Table 13.1,
          entry for ACHAR,
          "Convert ASCII code value to character"
          ->"Character from ASCII code value".
{It does not "convert" anything - the original is unchanged.  Its value is
 the character corresponding to that ASCII code value, viz "from".}

[319:8+7] Same table, entry for ADJUSTL,
          "Rotate string to remove leading blanks"
          -> "Left-justified string value".
{The string is not rotated, the result value is the rotation.  If making
 this one character longer breaks the typesetting, use a short version.}

[319:8+8] Same table, entry for ADJUSTR,
          "Rotate string to remove leading blanks"
          -> "Right-justified string value".
{The string is not rotated, the result value is the rotation.  If making
 this one character longer breaks the typesetting, use a short version.}

[319:8+11] Same table, entry for ALL,
          "Reduce logical array by AND operation"
          ->"Array reduced by .AND. operator"
{The original array is unchanged, should be a noun phrase.}

[319:8+12] Same table, entry for ALLOCATED,

 was inconsistent.}

[319:8+17] Same table, entry for ASSOCIATED,
           "Query pointer association status"
           ->"Pointer association status enquiry"

 association status, thus "enquiry".}

[320:top+5] Same table, entry for CHAR,
            "Convert code value to character"

 cosubscripts select, viz "from" those cosubscripts.}

                ->"Character set membership search".

[323:1+-3] Same table, entry for UNPACK,
           "Unpack a vector into an array"
           -> "Vector unpacked into an array".
{Noun phrase.  It does not unpack a vector into an array - the array is
 unchanged - it unpacks the vector to form a new array value.}

[323:1+-2] Same table, entry for VERIFY,
           "Search for a character not in a given set"
           -> "Character set non-membership search".
{Noun phrase.}

[c13 entirety] Change "Description" paragraphs to match the new wording.

[323:9] 13.5p5, "results returned from" -> "values assigned by".
{These are subroutines, they don't "return" values.}

[323:10+2] 13.5, Note 13.8, "returns" -> "assigns".
{Ditto.}

[325:7-8] 13.7.1 General, p2,
          "returned in a subroutine argument or function result"
           -> "assigned to a subroutine argument or returned by a function
               reference".
{The correct verb for assignment is "assigned (to)".
 The correct noun for referencing a function is "function reference".}

{NOTE: Large parts of 13.7.1p2 needs to be rewritten with extreme
       prejudice, but that is a horse of a different colour.}

[339:17-18] 13.7.42 CPU_TIME, Argument paragraph,
            Replace last two sentences "It ... returned" with
  "It is an INTENT (OUT) argument.  If the processor cannot provide a
   meaningful value for the time, it is assigned a processor-dependent
   negative value; otherwise it is assigned a processor-dependent
   approximation to the processor time in seconds."
{Correct verb.  Remove contradiction between the two sentences.}

[341:6] 13.7.44 DATE_AND_TIME, Arguments paragraph,
        "returned in" -> "assigned to".
{The correct verb for "assigned to" is "assigned to".}

[348:9] 13.7.61 FINDLOC, paragraph 5 (Result Value), Case (i),
        "the $i^{th}$ subscript returned lies"
        -> "the $i^{th}$ element value is".
{It doesn't "return" subscripts n times, its result is an array and this
 specifies the element values, see line 7.  And subscripts don't "lie".}

[347:13] Same paragraph, Case (ii)
         "the $i^{th}$ subscript returned lies"
         -> "the $i^{th}$ element value is".
{Ditto.}

[347:26-29] 13.7.61, paragraph (still in Result Value!), replace with
  "If DIM is not present, more than one element matches VALUE, and BACK is
   absent or present with the value false, the value returned indicates the
   first such element, taken in array element order.  If DIM is not present
   and BACK is present with the value true, the value returned indicates
   the last such element, taken in array element order."
{The original first sentence was entirely content-free.  The sentences need
 conditionalising on DIM being absent otherwise they contradict the
 definition of the function; and the result when DIM is present should be
 entirely specified by Case (iii) anyway.}

[351:22] 13.6.67 GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE, p3 (Arguments), TRIM_NAME,
         "returned" -> "assigned".
{Correct verb.}

[352:17] 13.7.70 IACHAR, p5 (Result Value),
         "A processor-dependent value is returned"
         -> "The value of the result is processor dependent".
{This one is just stylistic.}

[374:32] 13.7.123 NORM2, p4 (Result Characteristics),
         "$d_{\text{DIM-1}}$, $d_{\text{DIM+1}}$"
         ->$d_{\text{DIM}-1}$, $d_{\text{DIM}+1}$".
{Correct typesetting.}

[380:25] 13.7.136 RANDOM_SEED, p5 (within Arguments),
         "may be specified or returned"
         ->"can be retrieved or changed".
{Incorrect use of "may".  Incorrect use of "specified".  And "returned".
 But "be" and "or" are used correctly.}
[380:26] "returned by" -> "assigned to".
{The correct verb for "assigned" is "assigned".}
[380:27] "specified by" -> "of".
{Variables have values, they don't specify them.}


3. Other returns

There are various other uses of "return" that are merely poor style
rather than of questionable correctness.

This paper does not attempt to reword those.
