Background
==========

19-110r1 proposed rank-agnostic array declarations of the form

  real :: X(A)                          ! bounds of X == bounds of A
  real, rank=rank(B), allocatable :: Y  ! Deferred shape
  real, rank=rank(C), pointer :: P      ! Deferred shape
  real, rank=rank(D), intent(...) :: Z  ! Assumed shape

tbat would declare objects having the ranks of A, B, C, and D
respectively.

In the fourth case, intent(...) is, of course, not required; that Z is a
dummy argument would be obvious without it.

Assuming a dummy argument were declared using

  real, intent(in) :: A(:,:,:)

The obvious utility of

  real :: X(A)                     ! bounds of X == bounds of A

to declare an automatic "work" array, as opposed to

  real :: x(lbound(a,1)-1:ubound(a,1)+1, &
        &   lbound(a,2)-1:ubound(a,2)+1, &
        &   lbound(a,3)-1:ubound(a,3)+1) )

or an allocatable "work" array

  real, allocatable :: X(:,:,:)
  ...
  allocate ( x(lbound(a,1)-1:ubound(a,1)+1, &
           &   lbound(a,2)-1:ubound(a,2)+1, &
           &   lbound(a,3)-1:ubound(a,3)+1) )

was described in 19-110r1.

In a generic-programming context, one might declare

  module M(Q)
    real, rank=rank(Q), intent(in) :: A   ! Assumed shape
    real :: X(A)                          ! SHAPE(X) == SHAPE(A)

!  or

    real, rank=rank(Q), intent(in) :: A   ! Assumed shape
    real, rank=rank(A), allocatable :: X  ! Deferred shape
    ...
    allocate ( x(A) )
    ...
  end module M

The utility here is obvious.  The British might say "bleeding obvious." 
The response from JOR to the proposals in 19-110r1 was "Huh?" even
though there was an admonition in 19-110r1

  If you don't understand the implications of this, PLEASE ASK FOR MORE
  EXPLANATION!  There is nothing in DIMENSION(..) and SELECT RANK that
  provides any support in this direction.

Nobody asked for illumination.

The predecessor of 19-110r1, 18-247, was dismissed by JOR as being the
same as vector subscripts, even though specifying the bounds of an array
has nothing to do with subscripting, and the final example in 18-247
said

  This provides a more general scatter/gather facility than the present
  vector subscript facility.  This is not the same as using the elements
  of the rank-one sections in S as vector subscripts...

and

  S is NOT a vector subscript.

appeared in the paper.

Proposals
=========

1. Explicit shape
-----------------

Allow a rank-one array with extent given by a constant expression to
specify the rank and bounds of another array, e.g.

  real :: X(A)

declares an array X such that RANK(X) == RANK(A), and X has the same
bounds (not just shape) as A.  The bounds of A shall be specified by
constant expressions (any of its lower bounds might be the default "1"
value).

One bound of X could be a scalar, which is "broadcast" to the same shape
as the other bound (which determines the rank), e.g., allow

  real :: X ( 0 : shape(A)+1 ) )

instead of requiring

  real :: X ( [ ( 0, i = 1, rank(A) ) ] : shape(A)+1 ) )

2. Deferred shape
-----------------

2.1 Deferred-shape object declaration
.....................................

Allow to specify the rank of an allocatable or pointer object using a
RANK attribute, e.g.

  real, rank=rank(B), allocatable :: Y  ! Deferred shape
  real, rank=rank(C), pointer :: P      ! Deferred shape

For example, if SIZE(B) = 3, this is equivalent to

  real, allocatable :: Y(:,:,:)

which is not useful in a generic-programming context.

Whether B or C being a scalar is prohibited (e.g., in a
generic-programming context), results in declaring a scalar, or results
in declaring a new entity called a rank-zero array, can be decided in
due course.

2.2 Deferred shape object allocation
....................................

Allow to allocate a deferred-shape object using a rank-one object of
explicit shape and constant extent to specify bounds, e.g.

  allocate ( Y ( A ) ) ! lbound(Y) == [1,1,...], ubound(Y) == A,
                       ! SIZE(A,1) is a constant expression

or, more generally

  allocate ( Y ( B : A ) ) ! lbound(Y) == B, ubound(Y) == A, SIZE(A,1)
                           ! == SIZE(B,1) are constant expressions

e.g.,

  allocate ( Y ( lbound(A)-1 : ubound(A) + 1 )

insead of requiring

  allocate ( Y(lbound(a,1)-1:ubound(a,1)+1, &
           &   lbound(a,2)-1:ubound(a,2)+1, &
           &   lbound(a,3)-1:ubound(a,3)+1) )

The latter is not useful in a generic-programming context, wherein
RANK(Y) depends upon a generic parameter.

One bound could be a scalar, which is "broadcast" to the same shape as
the other bound, e.g.

  allocate ( Y ( 0 : shape(A)+1 ) )

instead of requiring

  allocate ( Y ( [ ( 0, i = 1, rank(A) ) ] : shape(A)+1 ) )

If the object (Y in the examples) is (allowed to be) a scalar, the
object used to declare the bounds (A in the examples) shall be an array,
and its extent shall be zero.

2.3 Pointer rank remapping
..........................

In a rank-remapping pointer assignment, the upper bounds of a pointer
object can be specified by a single rank-one array whose extent is a
constant expression

  P(A) => M(...)

in which case the lower bounds are all 1, or both bounds can be
specified by rank-one arrays whose extents are constant expressions that
have the same value

  P( lbound(A)-1 : ubound(A)+1 ) => M(...)

instead of requiring

  P( lbound(A,1)-1 : ubound(A,1)+1, &
   & lbound(A,2)-1 : ubound(A,2)+1, &
   & lbound(A,3)-1 : ubound(A,3)+1 ) => M(...)

The latter is not useful in a generic-programming context, wherein
RANK(A) depends upon a generic parameter.

In all cases, the rank of P is the extent of the bounds.

One set of bounds could be specified by a scalar, which is "broadcast"
to the same extent as the other bound, which specifies the rank, e.g.

  P ( 0 : shape(A)+1 ) => M(...)

instead of requiring

  P ( [ ( 0, i = 1, rank(A) ) ] : shape(A)+1 ) => M(...)

3. Assumed shape
-----------------

Allow to specify the rank of an assumed-shape object using a
RANK attribute, e.g.

  real, rank=rank(B) :: Y  ! Assumed shape if Y is a dummy argument
                           ! even if the INTENT attribute is not
                           ! specified

For example, if SIZE(B) = 3, this is equivalent to

  real :: Y(:,:,:)

which is not useful in a generic-programming context.

Whether B being a scalar is prohibited (e.g., in a generic-programming
context), results in declaring a scalar, or results in declaring a new
entity called a rank-zero array, can be decided in
