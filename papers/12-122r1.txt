1. Introduction

This paper discusses the standing documents and other procedures for the
next revision.  It might seem a bit early for the next revision but we are
accumulating editorial changes and technical fixes quite quickly.

Since I am looking at the standing documents, the web site's links are
also discussed.


2. Corrigenda edit question

It would be useful for the edits from the corrigenda be included in the
008.

ACTION: (i) Editor will include the edits from corrigendum 1 in either
            12-008r1 or 12-008r2.  At that time the title of the document
            will change.
	(ii) Web link title to be changed when the document title changes.

3. Editor's other standing documents

In the list below, the title listed is the one shown on the web site.

  historically; a new "empty" version has been submitted.
ACTION: Web link title change requested.

  A new version of this is underway (12-018) for 10-007r1.
  It will contain only the edits from corrigendum 1.
