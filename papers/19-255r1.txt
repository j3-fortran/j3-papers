Subject: Add reductions to DO CONCURRENT (US20)
Date: 2019-October-17

Reference: 18-007r1, 19-198r2

Introduction
============

Performing a reduction on the array elements computed
in DO CONCURRENT can be inefficient for large arrays.
Naive expressions of a reduction are non-conforming or
inefficient, requiring synchronization or explicit use
of temporaries.

At meeting 219, J3 approved continued work on this item,
passing paper 19-198r2.

At meeting 220, plenary approved including REDUCE variables with the
POINTER attribute. Plenary approved prohibiting REDUCE variables with
the ASYNCHRONOUS and VOLATILE attributes.


Requirements
============

Provide Fortran support for some of the features of the OpenMP
reduction clause on numeric and logical intrinsic types.

The proposal should support:
    1. Extend DO CONCURRENT to include the addition of scalar
       and array "reduction variables".

    2. Allow multiple reduction variables to be defined for a
       single DO CONCURRENT.

    3. Support a limited set of intrinsic binary and n-ary operators
       as reduction operators.

    4. Provide the implicit initialization of the reduction variables
       consistent with the reduction operators.

    5. Have reduction variable semantics aligned with existing
       locality specifications for DO CONCURRENT.

    6. Have behavior analogous to a limited version of the OpenMP
       reduction clause.


Specification
=============
1. Add a new locality-spec to describe reduction variables.
   Reduction variables are local to each iteration of the loop,
   initialized with a suitable value upon entry to the loop, but are
   related to a defined instance of the reduction variable in the
   scope outside the loop.

2. Provide a limited set of operators and functions that can be
   applied to reduction variables. This list is currently
           + * .AND. .OR. .EQV. .NEQV. MIN MAX IAND IOR IEOR

3. Provide for default initialization of reduction variables.
   A suitable initial value of an induction variable can be determined
   by its reduction operator.

4. Provide a limited number of ways that reduction variables can
   be defined in an iteration.
   We will limit the use of reduction variables to simplify implementation:
       var = var op expression
       var = expression op var
       var = function (var, expression)
       var = function (expression, var)
   for suitable values of op and function.
   For array reduction variables, var can be a contiguous array section
   of the reduction variable.

5. Upon normal completion of the DO CONCURRENT the value
   of each reduction variable will be as if the value of the reduction
   variable prior to the execution of the DO CONCURRENT was combined
   with each value of the reduction variable from each iteration of
   the loop via the reduce operator. This combination could be
   performed in any order.

6. The processor may make assumptions about how to parallelize the
   DO CONCURRENT iterations to optimize or eliminate synchronized
   access to the reduction variables.

7. Reduction variables may have the ALLOCATABLE attribute.

8. Reduction variables may have the POINTER attribute, and a copy
   of the target is available to the iterations.

9. Reduction variables cannot have the ASYNCHRONOUS or VOLATILE
   attributes.

8. Reduction variables may be contiguous array sections.

=================

{ edits in page order }

{ add remark to Introduction in the bullet for Execution control: }

[xiii] add:
"The REDUCE locality specifier for DO CONCURRENT provides the
ability to define reduction variables to be calculated on
the loop."

{ Introduction briefly describes new features }



{ 11.1.7.2 Form of the DO construct }
{ Extend the definition of locality-spec to include reduction variables}

[181:9] now reads:

"R1130 locality-spec is LOCAL ( variable-name-list )
                    or LOCAL_INIT ( variable-name-list )
                    or SHARED ( variable-name-list )
                    or DEFAULT ( NONE )"

after "DEFAULT ( NONE )" add "or REDUCE (reduce-op : variable-name-list)"

so the resulting rule reads
"R1130 locality-spec is LOCAL ( variable-name-list )
                    or LOCAL_INIT ( variable-name-list )
                    or SHARED ( variable-name-list )
                    or DEFAULT ( NONE )
                    or REDUCE (reduce-op : variable-name-list)"

{ Add to rule 1130 the new locality-spec }



{ Define a limited set of binary operators and procedures that can
   be used to combine values of the reduction variables}

[181:9+] After rule 1130, add new rules:

"R1130a  reduce-op is binary-reduce-op
                        or function-reduce-op

R1130b  binary-reduce-op is +
                        or *
                        or .AND.
                        or .OR.
                        or .EQV.
                        or .NEQV.

R1130c  function-reduce-op is MIN
                        or MAX
                        or IAND
                        or IOR
                        or IEOR"

{ The list of permissible reduction operations is defined }


{ Add restrictions on the variables in REDUCE locality-specs }

[181:26+] Add a new constraint

"C1128+    A variable-name that appears in a REDUCE locality-spec shall
           not have the ASYNCHRONOUS, INTENT (IN), OPTIONAL, or
           VOLATILE attribute, shall not be of finalizable type, shall
           not be a nonpointer polymorphic dummy argument, and shall
           not be a coarray or an assumed-size array. A variable-name
           that is not permitted to appear in a variable definition
           context shall not appear in a REDUCE locality-spec."

{ REDUCE variables are not allowed to be ASYNCHRONOUS, INTENT(IN),
  OPTIONAL, or VOLATILE }


{ REDUCE variables are of limited type }
[181:26+] After constraint C1128, add a new constraint:
"C1128+    A variable that appears in a REDUCE locality-spec
           shall be a scalar or array of type corresponding to its
           reduce-op as defined in Table 11.1."

[181:26+] Somewhere near the new constraint, add this table:
"
            Table 11.1. The types of the allowed operands
                      for each reduction operator.

      OPERATOR            ALLOWED TYPES
      --------            -------------
        +                 integer, real, complex
        *                 integer, real, complex
      .AND.               logical
      .OR.                logical
      .EQV.               logical
      .NEQV.              logical
       MIN                integer, real
       MAX                integer, real
       IAND               integer
       IOR                integer
       IEOR               integer"

{ REDUCE variables are limited to scalars or arrays of numeric
  or logical types }



{ 11.1.7.5 Additional semantics for DO CONCURRENT constructs }

{ Add REDUCE as a new kind of locality }

[184:28-31 p1] Now reads:
"The locality of a variable that appears in a DO CONCURRENT construct
is LOCAL, LOCAL_INIT, SHARED, or unspecified. A construct or statement
entity of a construct or statement within the DO CONCURRENT construct
has SHARED locality if it has the SAVE attribute. If it does not have
the SAVE attribute, it is a different entity in each iteration,
similar to LOCAL locality."

In line 28, replace "LOCAL, LOCAL_INIT, SHARED, or unspecified"
with "LOCAL, LOCAL_INIT, REDUCE, SHARED, or unspecified"
so that the first sentence of paragraph 1 reads:

"The locality of a variable that appears in a DO CONCURRENT construct
is LOCAL, LOCAL_INIT, REDUCE, SHARED, or unspecified. A construct or
statement entity of a construct or statement within the DO CONCURRENT
construct has SHARED locality if it has the SAVE attribute. If it does
not have the SAVE attribute, it is a different entity in each
iteration, similar to LOCAL locality."

{ REDUCE is added to the types of locality }



{ Describe REDUCE locality }

[184:43+] Add a paragraph to describe restrictions on REDUCE locality:
"A variable that has REDUCE locality is a construct entity with the
same type, type parameters, and rank as the variable with the same
name in the innermost executable construct or scoping unit that
includes the DO CONCURRENT construct, and the outside variable is
inaccessible by that name within the construct. The construct entity
has the CONTIGUOUS, POINTER, or TARGET attribute if and only if the
outside variable has that attribute; it does not have the BIND,
INTENT, PROTECTED, SAVE, or VALUE attribute, even if the outside
variable has that attribute. If it is not a pointer, it has the same
bounds as the outside variable. At the beginning of execution of each
iteration,
    - a variable with the POINTER attribute has the pointer
      association status of the outside variable. If it associated,
      the variable is associated with a copy of the target in the
      iteration.
    - reduce variables are defined to have an initial value
      corresponding to their reduce-op as specified in Table 11.2."


[184:43+] Add Table 11.2 near the above edit
"Table 11.2. The default initial values for
            each reduction operator.

  OPERATOR          INITIAL VALUE
  --------          -------------
    +                     0
    *                     1
  .AND.                .TRUE.
  .OR.                 .FALSE.
  .EQV.                .TRUE.
  .NEQV.               .FALSE.
   MIN                 nnlmsbtp *
   MAX                 pnlmsbtp **
   IAND                 NOT(0)
   IOR                    0
   IEOR                   0

  * nnlmsbtp = the value of the negative number of the largest
    magnitude supported by the processor for numbers of the type
    and kind of the reduction variable.

 ** pnlmsbtp = the value of the positive number of the largest
    magnitude supported by the processor for numbers of the type
    and kind of the reduction variable."

{ initial values are defined for variables based on
  the reduce-op in the reduce locality-spec }



{ 11.1.7.5 p 2 Add REDUCE to the LOCAL and LOCAL_INIT I/O, TARGET
  descriptions }

[185:1-4] Lines 1-4 after the bullet list currently reads:
"If a variable with LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT locality becomes an affector
of a pending input/output operation, the operation shall have
completed before the end of the iteration. If a variable with LOCAL or
LOCAL_INIT locality has the TARGET attribute, a pointer associated
with it during an iteration becomes undefined when execution of that
iteration completes.

In line 1, replace "LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT locality" with
"LOCAL, LOCAL_INIT, or REDUCE locality"

In line 2, replace "LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT locality" with
"LOCAL, LOCAL_INIT, or REDUCE locality"

so the paragraph now reads:
"If a variable with LOCAL, LOCAL_INIT, or REDUCE locality becomes an
affector of a pending input/output operation, the operation shall have
completed before the end of the iteration. If a variable with LOCAL,
LOCAL_INIT, or REDUCE locality has the TARGET attribute, a pointer
associated with it during an iteration becomes undefined when
execution of that iteration completes."

{ REDUCE behaves like LOCAL and LOCAL_INIT for I/O }



{ 11.1.7.2 After p2 Add restrictions on the use of REDUCE variables
  in the loop body }

[185:4+] Add a paragraph to describe restrictions
the on use of reduction variables:
"Variables listed in a REDUCE locality-spec can only appear
in the following forms within the body of the DO CONCURRENT:
   var = var binary-reduce-op expression
   var = expression binary-reduce-op var
   var = function-reduce-op( [expression-list ,] var [, expression-list] )
where var is an object-name, an array-element or an array-section."

[185:4+] After the above paragraph, add a constraint requiring the
designator to be contiguous:

"C1141+   An array-section that references a reduction variable
         shall be contiguous."

{ Reduction variable use is restricted }


{ Add semantics for loop termination and REDUCE variables }

[185:4+] After the above, add a paragraph
"For DO CONCURRENT statements with a REDUCE locality-spec, the value of
each reduction variable is its value before the DO CONCURRENT combined
via the reduce-op with the values of each iteration's reduction
variable at the termination of the iteration. For array reduction
variables, this application is done elementwise. The application of
the reduction operators to the results of each iteration can be done
in any order."

{ Reduction variables actually reduce }



{ end }
