TITLE: DO CONCURRENT and POINTER
KEYWORDS: DO CONCURRENT, POINTER
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the following example:

  REAL,POINTER :: x(:)
  REAL y(4)
  DO CONCURRENT (i=1:4)
    IF (IAND(i,1)==1) THEN
      ALLOCATE(x(i))
      x = 3           ! Note: defines x, does not reference x.
    ELSE
      y(i) = SUM(x)   ! (*) Note: references x.
      DEALLOCATE(x)
    END IF
  END DO

This is clearly not conforming, as it violates the requirement in
[178:8-9 8.1.6.7p1 second bullet]:

  "A pointer that is referenced in an iteration either shall be
   previously pointer associated during that iteration, or shall not
   have its pointer association changed during any iteration."

However, consider example 2, identical except for replacing the (*)
statement with:

      y(i) = SIZE(x)   ! (*) Note: SIZE does not reference x.

That statement does not reference x (see definition of reference at
1.3.120) and so does not violate the requirement.

An even simpler example which does not violate the requirement but
which appears problematic is

  POINTER p
  NULLIFY(p)
  DO CONCURRENT(i=1:2)
    IF (i==1) ALLOCATE(p)
    IF (i==2) PRINT *,ASSOCIATED(p)
  END DO

A third example which does not violate the requirement but again
appears to be problematic is

  PROCEDURE(),POINTER :: p,q
  EXTERNAL a,b
  p => a
  DO CONCURRENT(i=1:2)
    IF (i==1) p => b
    IF (i==2) q => p    ! (*1)
  END DO
  CALL q                ! (*2)

Note that (*1) does not reference p, but (*2) does reference q.
The pointer q is only set by one iteration, so no problem there.

Were these examples intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

No, the examples were not intended to be standard-conforming.  An edit
is supplied to correct the requirement.

Comment: We don't need to require "pointer associated" for
         "reference", that is always required for references.
         What we need to require is for the pointer association
         status to be established.

EDITS to 10-007:

[178:8-9] Replace the sentence

            "A pointer that is referenced ... any iteration."

          with the following sentence:

  "A pointer that is used in an iteration other than as the pointer in
   pointer assignment, allocation, or nullification, either shall be
   previously pointer-assigned, allocated, or nullified in that
   iteration or shall not have its pointer association changed during
   any iteration."
