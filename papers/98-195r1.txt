          All references in the following are to 98-007r2.

          The facilities described below provide a complete facility
          for interoperability of C characters with Fortran
          characters.  No additional facilities are required to
          manipulate C strings in Fortran.

          Handling of characters
          ----------------------

          In C, objects that are of a character type contain a single
          character value.  In Fortran, entities of type character
          can be composed of more than one character value.  In C,
          multi-character objects are created using arrays, and in
          the case of strings, a specially distinguished NULL
          character marks the end of the string.

          In order to facilitate passing Fortran character entities
          with character length parameters greater than one to C
          strings, the Fortran rules on sequence association need to
          be relaxed.  Today, the following is a valid Fortran
          program:

                program p
                  character(10) :: a(1)
                  call sub(a)
                contains
                  subroutine sub(b)
                    character(1) :: b(10)
                  end subroutine sub
                end program p

          but the following is not:

                program p
                  character(10) :: a
                  call sub(a)
                contains
                  subroutine sub(b)
                    character(1) :: b(10)
                  end subroutine sub
                end program p

          That is, sequence association involving characters permits
          arrays of characters to blur the division between the number
          of array elements and the length of the element, but this
          blurring only applies when an actual argument is a character
          array, an element of a character array or a substring of
          such an array element, but does not allow a scalar of type
          character to be argument associated with a dummy argument
          associated with a character array, unless it is an element
          of a character array.

          In order to make this change, the rules in 12.4.1.1
          [227:13-15] and 12.4.1.4 need to be modified to allow this.

          Note:  This change could conceivably cause problems for some
                 Fortran 95 processor, though whether there is
                 actually a processor that relies on this is unclear.

          An example of this approach as it applies to
          interoperability:

                program p
                  interface
                    bind(c) subroutine myprintf(dummy)
                      ! The Fortran array corresponds with the C
                      ! array dummy
                      character(1) :: dummy(0:12)
                    end subroutine myprintf
                  end interface
                  character(13) :: actual = "Hello, world!"

                  ! actual is a scalar that is not an array
                  ! element, which is not currently allowed
                  call myprintf(actual)
                end program p

                void myprintf(char dummy[13])
                { ... }

          Note:  This approach was preferred in a straw vote to the
          alternative of allowing Fortran scalar characters to
          interoperate with C character arrays by a vote of 6-4-1.  An
          additional straw vote on whether this extension to sequence
          association should be permitted only in references to
          BIND(C) procedures passed by a vote of 5-4-2.  A third straw
          vote on whether to allow this extension to other types
          failed by a vote of 2-8-2.

          In order to simplify things, subgroup decided to ignore the
          result of the second straw vote.

          Sample edits:
            In 5.1.2.4.4 [63:38+]
                  Add    "If the actual argument is of type default
                          character and is a scalar that is not an
                          array element or array element substring
                          designator, the size of the dummy array is
                          MAX(INT(l/e), 0), where e is the length of
                          an element in the dummy character array, and
                          l is the length of the actual argument."

            In 12.4.1.1 [226:9-10]
                  Change "or array element"
                  to     "array element, or scalar"

            In 12.4.1.1 [226:11]
                  After  "array"
                  add    "or scalar"

            In 12.4.1.1 [227:14-15]
                  Change "or a substring of such an element"
                  to     "or a scalar of type default character".

            In 12.4.1.4 [228:45]
                  Change "an array element substring designator"
                  to     "a scalar of type default character"


            In 12.4.1.4 [229:8+]
                  Add    "If the actual argument is of type default
                          character and is a scalar that is not an
                          array element or array element substring
                          designator, the element sequence consists
                          of the character storage units of the actual
                          argument."
          Null characters
          ---------------

          The C character and wchar_t data types have designated null
          characters, whose value is zero.  The ISO_C_TYPES module
          shall make accessible a named constant, C_NULLCHAR, of type
          charcter, whose kind type parameter is equal to the value of
          C_CHAR.  The value of C_NULLCHAR shall be equal to the value
          of the null character of the C char data type.

          Note:  A straw vote on whether to use CHAR(0) vs. a
          C_NULLCHAR named constant showed a preference for C_NULLCHAR
          (2-6-3).

          Length type parameters
          ----------------------

          The character length parameter of a Fortran entity that
          interoperates with a C entity shall not be an asterisk.
