Subject: Editor's list of unresolved technical issues
Date: 2006/09/21

A. Introduction
---------------

This document lists the technical issues raised by the editor with the 007.
Issues are separated into two lists; the resolved ones and the unresolved ones.
When an issue is resolved, the J3 note in the 007 will be deleted and the item
moved from the unresolved list to the resolved list.  Issue numbers will not
be reused.

Note that several issues were raised with the Enhanced Modules Technical
Report.  Because this was not an official 007, these were given numbers in
the range 5000+ so as not to conflict.  These issues are also listed in this
document.

The one-line description is just a hint as to the issue, not a comprehensive
statement of it.
