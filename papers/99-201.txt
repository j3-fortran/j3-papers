QUESTION:

Consider the following module:

MODULE m
  TYPE t
    REAL,POINTER :: value
  END TYPE
  INTERFACE ASSIGNMENT(=)
    MODULE PROCEDURE t_asgn_t
  END INTERFACE
CONTAINS
  PURE SUBROUTINE t_asgn_t(lhs,rhs)
    TYPE(t),INTENT(OUT) :: lhs
    TYPE(t),INTENT(IN) :: rhs
    ALLOCATE(lhs%value)
    lhs%value = rhs%value
  END SUBROUTINE
  PURE FUNCTION t_plus_t(a,b)
    TYPE(t) t_plus_t,a,b
    INTENT(IN) a,b
    t_plus_t = a                                     !defined assignment
!Alternative: CALL t_asgn_t(a,b)
    t_plus_t%value = t_plus_t%value + b%value
  END FUNCTION
END

According to F95 [212:33-45]
  "Constraint: In a pure subprogram any variable which ... is a dummy
argument
               to a pure function ... shall not be used in the following
               contexts:
               ...
               (8) As the <expr> of an <assignment-stmt> in which the
                   <variable> is of a derived type if the derived type has a
                   pointer component at any level of component selection;
..."

Therefore it appears that the statement labelled "defined assignment" is not
allowed.  However, it is semantically equivalent to the commented-out
statement
in the following line, which would have been allowed.

Clearly intrinsic assignment in that context must be disallowed as it
implicitly does a pointer assignment which could be used to produce a
side-effect, but the standard appears to rule out defined assignment as
well (which if pure cannot cause any side-effect).

Is this intentional?
