Subject: Edits for C_LOC and C_F_POINTER
Date:    2-apr-2003

This paper aims to address this point made by Richard Maine in
commenting on the CD:

T8. The descriptions of C_LOC and C_F_POINTER are so incomprehensible
    as to constitute technical, rather then mere wording flaws.
    The descriptions are full of requirements that are assumed rather
    than stated, and other requirements that contradict each other by
    failing to state assumed conditions.  For the simplest example,
    [384:20] says without qualification "FPTR shall be scalar",
    although there is lots of discussion of cases where it is an
    array; this requirement is clearly intended to apply only in
    some cases, but that isn't stated.  Ref 02-276, 02-230r3.

Subgroup would like to acknowledge the help of John Reid, Aleksandar
Donev, Richard Maine, and Van Snyder in constructing this paper.

Richard's points have been addressed with a complete rewrite of the
descriptions. We have tried to keep as much as possible of the earlier
words and not to alter the functionality.

We noticed that zero-sized arrays were not excluded. We think that this
is needed since a zero-sized array does not have an address. In fact,
we think that a zero-sized array should not be interoperable.

We considered returning C_NULL_PTR from C_LOC for a zero-sized array,
but rejected this for consistency with the case of an unallocated 
allocatable variable or a disassociated pointer. It will also make
C_LOC faster since no test for zero size is needed.  

We have also made each description into a subclause in the style of the
intrinsic procedure definitions and put them in alphabetic order.

Some of the Edits originally in 03-120 have been incorporated into
this paper and removed from 03-120r1.

Additional concerns raised by Richard regarding the problem of using
the status of an argument as a function or a data object to resolve a
generic refernce have lead to specification of separate functions for
data and function arguments.  

EDITS

382:13. Replace "C_LOC function is" with "C_LOC and C_FUNLOC functions
are".

382:15-16. Replace "C_F_POINTER subroutine" with "C_F_POINTER and 
C_F_PROCPOINTER subroutines".

382:17-383:10+. Delete present definition of C_LOC and NOTE 15.3.

386:3+6-7. Change "The function ... is interoperable" to
  "The function C_LOC can be used to return a value of type C_PTR that
   is the C address of an allocated allocatable variable The function
   C_FUNLOC can be used to return a value of type C_FUNPTR that is the 
   C address of a procedure.  For C_LOC and C_FUNLOC the returned
   value is interoperable"
{"value" is the correct term for the result of a function; entity is
unnecessarily vague - C_LOC does not return a POINTER to a TYPE(C_PTR),
it returns a value of TYPE(C_PTR).}

388:10. After 'if' add 'its size is nonzero and'.

383:11. Make into subclause 15.1.2.1 heading line.

384:1-20+. Replace present definition of C_LOC and NOTES 15.5 and 15.6 by 

15.1.2.2 C_F_POINTER (CPTR, FPTR [, SHAPE])

Description. Associates a data pointer with the target of a C pointer and
specifies its shape.

Class. Subroutine.

Arguments.

CPTR   shall be a scalar of type C_PTR. It is an INTENT(IN) argument. 
       Its value shall be:

       Case (i):  The C address of an interoperable data entity, or

       Case (ii): The result of a reference to C_LOC with a 
       noninteroperable argument.

       The value of CPTR shall not be the C address of a Fortran
       variable that does not have the TARGET attribute.

FPTR   shall be a pointer. It is an INTENT(OUT) argument.

       Case (i): If the value of CPTR is the C address of an
       interoperable data entity, FPTR shall be a data pointer with
       type and type parameters interoperable with the type of the
       entity. In this case, FPTR becomes pointer associated with the
       target of CPTR. If it is an array, its shape is specified by
       SHAPE and each lower bound is 1.

       Case (ii): If the value of CPTR is the result of a reference to
       C_LOC with a noninteroperable argument X, FPTR shall be a
       nonpolymorphic scalar pointer with the same type and type
       parameters as X. In this case, X or its target if it is a
       pointer shall not have been deallocated or have become undefined
       due to execution of a RETURN or END statement since the
       reference. FPTR becomes pointer associated with
       X or its target.

SHAPE (optional) shall be of type integer and rank one. It is an
       INTENT(IN) argument. SHAPE shall be present if and only if
       FPTR is an array; its size shall be equal to the rank of FPTR.


15.1.2.3 C_F_PROCPOINTER (CPTR, FPTR)

Description. Associates a procedure pointer with the target of a 
C function pointer.

Class. Subroutine.

Arguments.

CPTR   shall be a scalar of type C_FUNPTR. It is an INTENT(IN) argument. 
       Its value shall be the C address of a procedure that is 
       interoperable.

FPTR   shall be a procedure pointer. It is an INTENT(OUT) argument. 
       The interface for FPTR shall be interoperable with the prototype 
       that describes the target of CPTR. FPTR becomes pointer associated 
       with the target of CPTR.


NOTE 15.4

The term "target" in the descriptions of C_F_POINTER and C_F_PROCPOINTER
denotes the entity referenced by a C pointer, as described in 6.2.5 of 
the C standard.



15.1.2.4 C_FUNLOC (X)

Description. Returns the C address of the argument.

Class. Inquiry function.

Argument. X shall either be a procedure that is interoperable, or
            a procedure pointer associated with an interoperable procedure.

Result Characteristics. Scalar of type C_FUNPTR. 

Result Value.

The result value will be described using the result name CPTR. The result 
is determined as if C_FUNPTR were a derived type containing an 
implicit-interface procedure pointer component PX and the pointer assignment 
CPTR%PX => X were executed.

The result is a value that can be used as an actual CPTR argument in a
call to C_F_PROCPOINTER where FPTR has attributes that would allow the
pointer assignment FPTR => X. Such a call to C_F_PROCPOINTER shall have the
effect of the pointer assignment FPTR => X.


15.1.2.5 C_LOC (X)

Description. Returns the C address of the argument.

Class. Inquiry function.

Argument. X shall either

(1)   have interoperable type and type parameters and be

      (a) a variable that has the TARGET attribute and is interoperable,

      (b) an allocated allocatable variable that has the TARGET attribute
          and is not an array of zero size, or

      (c) an associated scalar pointer, or

(2)   be a nonpolymorphic scalar, have no nonkind type parameters, and be

      (a) a nonallocatable, nonpointer variable that has the TARGET 
          attribute,

      (b) an allocated allocatable variable that has the TARGET attribute, or

      (c) an associated scalar pointer.

Result Characteristics. Scalar of type C_PTR.

Result Value.

The result value will be described using the result name CPTR.

Case (i): If X is a scalar data entity, the result is determined as if
C_PTR were a derived type containing a scalar pointer component PX of
the type and type parameters of X and the pointer assignment CPTR%PX =>
X were executed.

Case (ii): If X is an array data entity, the result is determined as
if C_PTR were a derived type containing a scalar pointer component PX
of the type and type parameters of X and the pointer assignment of
CPTR%PX to the first element of X were executed.

If X is a data entity that is interoperable or has interoperable type
and type parameters, the result is the value that the C processor
returns as the result of applying the unary "&" operator (as defined in
the C standard, 6.5.3.2) to the target of CPTR%PX.

The result is a value that can be used as an actual CPTR argument in a
call to C_F_POINTER where FPTR has attributes that would allow the
pointer assignment FPTR => X. Such a call to C_F_POINTER shall have the
effect of the pointer assignment FPTR => X.

NOTE 15.5

Where the actual argument is of noninteroperable type or type
parameters, the result of C_LOC provides an opaque "handle" for it. In
an actual implementation, this handle may be the C address of the
argument; however, portable C functions should treat it as a void
(generic) C pointer that cannot be dereferenced (6.5.3.2 in the C
standard).
