NUMBER: F08/0136
TITLE: Argument correspondence with VALUE and ASYNCHRONOUS
KEYWORDS: VALUE, ASYNCHRONOUS, coindexed, contiguous
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

Consider the following three programs and discussions:

program P1
  real, asynchronous :: X[*]
  call S1 ( X [ 1 ] )
contains
  subroutine S1 ( A )
    real, value, asynchronous :: A
    a = 3
  end subroutine S1
end program P1

Program P1 appears to violate C1238 which says
  "An actual argument that is a coindexed object with the ASYNCHRONOUS
   or VOLATILE attribute shall not correspond to a dummy argument that
   has either the ASYNCHRONOUS or VOLATILE attribute."
but the dummy argument is not associated with the actual argument so
it is unclear why that should be the case.

program P2
  real, asynchronous :: X(3)
  call S2A ( X )
contains
  subroutine S2A ( A )
    real, asynchronous :: A(:)
    call S2B ( A(1:3) )
  end subroutine S2A
  subroutine S2B ( A )
    real, value, asynchronous :: A(:)
    a = 3
  end subroutine S2B
end program P2

This appears to violate C1239 which says
  "If an actual argument is a nonpointer array that has the
   ASYNCHRONOUS or VOLATILE attribute but is not simply contiguous
   (6.5.4), and the corresponding dummy argument has either the
   VOLATILE or ASYNCHRONOUS attribute, that dummy argument shall be an
   assumed-shape array that does not have the CONTIGUOUS attribute."
but again, it is unclear why that should matter for a VALUE dummy
argument.

program P3
  real, target :: X(3)
  real, pointer, asynchronous :: Y(:)
  y => x
  call S3 ( y )
contains
  subroutine S3 ( A )
    real, value, asynchronous :: A(:)
    a = 3
  end subroutine S3
end program P3

This program appears to violate C1240 which says
  "If an actual argument is an array pointer that has the ASYNCHRONOUS
   or VOLATILE attribute but does not have the CONTIGUOUS attribute,
   and the corresponding dummy argument has either the VOLATILE or
   ASYNCHRONOUS attribute, that dummy argument shall be an array
   pointer or an assumed-shape array that does not have the CONTIGUOUS
   attribute."
but it is unclear why this should matter for a VALUE dummy argument.

Are those programs intended to be standard-conforming?

ANSWER:

Yes, all those programs were intended to be standard-conforming.
There is no need for those constraints to apply to dummy arguments
with the VALUE attribute, because a VALUE dummy argument is not
associated with the actual argument but with an anonymous definable
data object.

Edits are supplied to correct the mistakes in the constraints.

EDITS:

[295:6] 12.5.2.4 Ordinary dummy arguments, C1238,
  Between "VOLATILE attribute" and "."
  insert  ", unless the dummy argument has the VALUE attribute".

[295:9] Same subclause, C1239,
        After "ASYNCHRONOUS attribute"
        insert ", but does not have the VALUE attribute,".

[295:13] Same subclause, C1240,
         After "ASYNCHRONOUS attribute"
         insert ", but does not have the VALUE attribute,".
