Interp F08/0055 failed {11-241} interp letter ballot #24 {11-229}:

The failed interp used the term "decimal exponent value" without
providing a definition for the term.  This revised interp avoids
use of the term.

QUESTION:

Q1. Gw.d editing for a real value that is in the range (0.1,10**d) and
    is not near an integer power of 10 uses F editing to produce
    exactly a value with d significant digits.  For values in this
    range that are near an integer power of 10, is it intended that F
    editing be used to produce a value with d significant digits?

The rules in 10.7.5.2.2 usually have this effect, but the following
examples illustrate exceptions for rounding UP and to ZERO.
     print "(ru,g11.2)", -9.95
     print "(rz,g11.2)", -9.95
When rounded to two significant digits these are both equal to -9.9,
however following through the rules in the standard it says to use
F7.0 format which will give the result -9. (only one significant
digit).  For positive values, rounding DOWN and to ZERO
     print "(rd,g11.2)", 9.95
     print "(rz,g11.2)", 9.95
both give the result 9.9 according to the rules in the standard.

Q2. Is Gw.d editing intended to use F editing when that produces d
    significant digits?

It usually achieves this, but for
     print "(ru,0p,g11.2)", -99.5
the standard requires 0PE11.2 editing to be used, which gives
     -0.99E+02
even though F7.2 editing can represent it as -99.

Similarly for
     print "(ru,0p,g11.2)", 99.
the standard requires 0PE11.2 editing to be used, which gives
0.99E+02, even though it is representable in F7.2 format as 99.

Q3. COMPATIBLE and NEAREST modes of rounding differ only when the two
    nearest representable values are equidistant from the given
    value.  The similarity appears not to be represented in the second
    table.  What is meant by "if the higher value is even"?

If by "even" we mean the last digit is even, then since we are talking
about a mantissa which is close to 10, COMPATIBLE and NEAREST would
have the same effect.

Q4. The table has no entry for PROCESSOR_DEFINED rounding; since there
    is no value specified for r, it is impossible to interpret the
    table, which seems to indicate that it would not be standard
    conforming to use G editing with PROCESSOR_DEFINED.  How does the
    PROCESSOR_DEFINED I/O rounding mode affect G editing?

Q5. According to 10.7.2.3.7 paragraphs 3 and 4, the effect of NEAREST
    is processor dependent unless IEEE rounding on conversions is
    supported.  How does this affect G editing?

Q6. Consider
        PRINT '(5(1X,1PG9.0))', 0.0, 0.04, 0.06, 0.4, 0.6
    noting that these values are strictly monotonic increasing.
    The standard appears to say that the output should be
        0.E+00  4.E-02  0.      0.      6.E-01
    which is decidedly not monotonic increasing.
    Is this intentional?

ANSWER:

A1. Yes, it is intended to produce output with d significant digits.
    The algorithm for choosing the output form for some I/O rounding
    modes is defective.  An edit is provided to replace this
    algorithm.

A2. Yes.  This is solved by the same edit.

A3. This question is rendered moot by the same edit.

A4. This question is rendered moot by the same edit.

A5. This question is rendered moot by the same edit.

A6.  No.  An edit is supplied to fix this.

EDITS to 10-007r1:

[24:11+] In 1.6.2, insert new paragraph following paragraph 1:
  "The form produced by the G edit descriptor for some values and some
   I/O rounding modes differs from that specified by Fortran 2003."

[24:27+] In 1.6.3, append new bullet item
  "- The form produced by the G edit descriptor with d==0 differs from
     that specified by Fortran 95 for some values.".

[25:6] In 1.6.4, replace the last full stop with semicolon and insert
       new bullet item
  "- the G edit descriptor with d==0 for some values.".

[258:14-]
  Insert new paragraph
    "If \si{d} is zero, \si{k}PE\si{w}.0 or \si{k}PE\si{w}.0E\si{e}
     editing is used for G\si{w}.0 editing or G\si{w}.0E\si{e} editing
     respectively."
{Without the italics markup, this is
    "If d is zero, kPEw.0 or kPEw.0Ee editing is used for Gw.0 editing
     or Gw.0Ee editing respectively."}

[258:15-19]
  Replace the second and subsequent sentences of paragraph 4 including
  the two internal pseudo-tables by

 "If the internal value is a zero value, let $s$ be one.  If the
  internal value is a number other than zero, let \it{N} be the decimal
  value that is the result of converting the internal value to \si{d}
  significant digits according to the I/O rounding mode and let $s$ be
  the integer such that $10^{s-1}$ <= \it{N} < $10^s$.  If
  0<=$s$<=\si{d}, F(\si{w}-\it{n}).(\si{d}-$s$),n('b') editing is used
  where \it{b} is a blank and \it{n} is 4 for G\si{w}.\si{d} editing
  and \si{e}+2 for G\si{w}.\si{d}E\si{e} editing.  If $s$<0 or
  $s$>\si{d}, \si{k}PE\si{w}.\si{d} or \si{k}PE\si{w}.\si{d}E\si{e}
  editing is used for G\si{w}.\si{d} editing or G\si{w}.\si{d}E\si{e}
  editing respectively."
{Note: \it{something} is something in italics,
       \si{something} is a syntax term (in italics),
       and $something$ is LaTeX math notation.
 Without the italics markup, this is
 "If the internal value is a zero value, let s be one.  If the
  internal value is a number other than zero, let N be the decimal
  value that is the result of converting the internal value to d
  significant digits according to the I/O rounding mode and let s be
  the integer such that 10^(s-1) <= N < 10^s.  If
  0<=s<=d, F(w-n).(d-s),n('b') editing is used
  where b is a blank and n is 4 for Gw.d editing
  and e+2 for Gw.dEe editing.  If s<0 or
  s>d, kPEw.d or kPEw.dEe
  editing is used for Gw.d editing or Gw.dEe
  editing respectively."}
