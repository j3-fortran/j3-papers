Subject: Issue 40 : INQUIRE(TEAM=) and TEAM_IMAGES
Reference: J3/06-007


Discussion of Issue 40 (page 222)

Yes, it would be a good idea to add INQUIRE(TEAM=). For symmetry with
OPEN, it should return a scalar of type IMAGE_TEAM. We will need a null
value for the case where the unit or file is not connected.  Since the
user will need to know the list of images involved, we also need to add
an intrinsic that is given a scalar of type IMAGE_TEAM and returns the
list of image indices.

[249:14+] Add
    <<or>> TEAM=<image-team>

[254:17+] Add
    9.9.1.30a TEAM= specifier in the INQUIRE statement

    The <image-team> in the TEAM= specifier is assigned the value of
    the connect team if the file or unit is connected; otherwise
    it is assigned the value NULL_IMAGE_TEAM (13.8.3.5).

    Note 9.67a
    The indices of the images in a team may be obtained by using the
    intrinsic function TEAM_IMAGES (13.170a)
    [end Note]


[348:27+] Add
    TEAM_IMAGES(TEAM)    Indices of images in a team

[432:18+] Add
    13.7.170a    TEAM_IMAGES(TEAM)

      <<Description.>> Returns the set of images in a team.

      <<Class.>> Transformational function.

      <<Argument.>> TEAM shall be a scalar of type IMAGE_TEAM
      (13.8.3.5).

      <<Result Characteristics.>> Array of rank one, type default
      integer, and size the number of images in the team specified
      by TEAM.

      <<Result Value.>> The result has a value equal to an array whose
      element values are indices of the images in the team specified
      by TEAM.

     <<Examples.>> If the value of TEAM was defined by the statement
             CALL FORM_TEAM(TEAM,[1,2,3,4])
     the value of TEAM_IMAGES(TEAM) is [1,2,3,4]. The value of
     TEAM_IMAGES (NULL_IMAGE_TEAM) is an array of size zero.

[438:24+] Add a new sentence:

     NULL_IMAGE_TEAM is a value of type IMAGE_TEAM that identifies
     a team with no images.
