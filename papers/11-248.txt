Discussion

C530 of N1830 has been extended to

"An entity with the CONTIGUOUS attribute shall be an array pointer,
an assumed-shape array, or have assumed rank."

The processor is obliged to support a discontiguous actual argument
being associated with an assumed-rank dummy argument with the
CONTIGUOUS attribute. It will probably do this by making a copy.
The text in the standard needs to allow for this happening.

Apart from wording changes for extra clarity, the edits here are those
of DIN comment 2. An additional change was proposed for C.9.4 para 2,
but this text is not discussing the assumed-rank case.


Edits to N1869:

6.7, Edits to clause 12. Add the following edits:

   12.5.2.4, line 2 of para 10: after "the contiguous attribute",
        add ", an assumed-rank entity with the CONTIGUOUS attribute
        that is associated with an array actual argument"

   12.5.2.4, para 18, C1239 (concerns ASYNCHRONOUS): replace
        the text "or an assumed-shape ... attribute" by
        ", an assumed-shape array without the CONTIGUOUS attribute,
         or an assumed-rank array without the CONTIGUOUS attribute".

   12.5.2.4, para 18, C1240 (concerns ASYNCHRONOUS): replace the
        the text "or an assumed-shape ... attribute" by
        ", an assumed-shape array without the CONTIGUOUS attribute,
         or an assumed-rank array without the CONTIGUOUS attribute".

   12.5.2.13, para 1, item (3) (b): replace "or an assumed-shape
        array without the CONTIGUOUS attribute" by
        ", an assumed-rank entity that is associated with a scalar
        actual argument, an assumed-rank entity without the
        CONTIGUOUS attribute, or an assumed-shape array without the
        CONTIGUOUS attribute".

   12.5.2.13, para 1, item (4) (b): replace "or an assumed-shape
        array without the CONTIGUOUS attribute" by
        ", an assumed-rank entity that is associated with a scalar
        actual argument, an assumed-rank entity without the
        CONTIGUOUS attribute, or an assumed-shape array without the
        CONTIGUOUS attribute".
