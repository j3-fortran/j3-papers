Subject: Interop TR: establishment and descriptor restrictions
Date: 2011 June 10
Reference: N1854, 11-168, 11-175


This paper proposes nothing, but attempts to give some of the reasoning
behind 11-168 and 11-175.

N1854 [17:21-23] takes the hard line for CFI_section but punts in
CFI_establish.  11-128 converts the latter to also following the hard
line, and 11-175 makes it clearer that it is being taken.  The question
here is whether this is the correct decision.  I.e. should CFI_establish
be allowed to break the rules?

A meta-point is that saying that C can do only things that are possible
in Fortran is not going to be comprehensible to the vast majority of
people reading this TR.  Not merely will some of them not be Fortran
programmers, being able to translate what is possible in Fortran terms
to C terms requires a knowledge of BOTH languages AND some knowledge
of implementation techniques.


Serious Defects in N1854
------------------------

There are a few things specified by N1854 that simply cannot work, but
are not currently excluded or where the existing wording is extremely
unclear and arguably ambiguous, such as:

    1) Creating an allocatable descriptor ab initio is impossible using
CFI_allocate, but it is very easy to misread the specification.

    CFI_DESC_T(3) object;
    CFI_index_t lower(3) = {1,1,1}, upper(3) = {5,5,5};
    ... = CFI_allocate(&object,lower,upper,8);

CFI_DESC_T allocates the space, but does not set the rank, type or
elem_len, so that both the rank and type will be unset.

    2) Creating a pointer descriptor ab initio is impossible using
CFI_setpointer, but it is very easy to misread the specification.

    CFI_DESC_T(3) object;
    ... = CFI_setpointer(&object,NULL,NULL);

CFI_DESC_T allocates the space, but does not set the rank, type or
elem_len, so that all of those will be unset.

    3) Changing the rank or type and (except for character objects)
elem_len of an existing pointer will cause chaos, but is not forbidden
by CFI_setpointer.  Worse, it is not clear that it SHOULD be forbidden
for descriptors created in C.  There is an error code, but it is not
stated that it must be or even may be returned.

    4) See the next section.

in the cases of (1) and (2), the term "C descriptor" means "established
C descriptor".  I do not regard this as likely to be understood by
people who were not involved in developing this TR.  If that is solved
by a definition of the term, the question still remains over whether the
rules on descriptor creation in CFI_establish, CFI_allocate and
CFI_setpointer are all similar, or different.

All of these can be solved by the proposals in 11-168; if that is not
accepted, they must be solved some other way.


Ambiguously Aliasing Descriptors
------------------------------

There are descriptors that cause illegal aliasing in the Fortran
standard, but do not do so in the C one.  People not familiar with
implementation techniques, and especially the 99% of programmers who
believe that Fortran mandates call-by-reference, WILL misunderstand.

Currently, CFI_establish allows these to be created.  These will cause
havoc, especially in combination with coarrays, OpenMP or MPI, and will
simply not work as soon as the Fortran compiler does anything outside
the call-by-reference model.

On this matter, Fortran 90 and successors are clear that an array is an
object, and aliasing occurs at the whole object level.  Fortran 77 was
much less clear, and the situation is still murky to do with
assumed-size arrays (I believe that an interpretation is needed, now
that we have coarrays).

However, C and C++ are very, very different; aliasing occurs at the
lvalue level.  Except where there are non-lvalue accesses :-(  Without
restrict, updating overlapping 'arrays' with no synchronisation is
defined, provided that the same element (and THAT is a murky concept, in
itself) is not updated.  With restrict, the situation is similar to
Fortran assumed-size, though not identical.

As an example, consider flattening an array.  C and C++ arrays are
always contiguous, as are Fortran arrays of 'simple' types when they are
declared or allocated, and the following is legal in C, if only the
correctly associated elements are accessed via the new descriptor.  It
is assuredly not legal in Fortran and will at least sometimes cause
chaos if passed to Fortran.

    void flatten (CFI_desc_t *arg) {
        CFI_DESC_T(1) flat;
        CFI_dim_t dim[1] = {0,0,1};
        int i;
        for (i = 0; i < arg->rank; ++i)
            dim[0].extent += arg->dim[i].extent*arg->dim[i].sm;
        dim[0].extent /= arg->dim[i].elem_len;
        (void)CFI_establish((CFI_desc_t *)&flat,arg->base_addr,
            CFI_attribute_assumed,arg->type,arg->elem_len,1,dim);
        operate(&flat);
    }

Unfortunately, CFI_establish is defined in terms of being a C function,
and so it is ambiguous as to which rules should be used.  This
critically needs fixing.


Fancy Descriptors
-----------------

11-175 was written following various cross-purpose discussions on using
CFI_section to create diagonal vectors.  This paper will not repeat the
discussion in that, but attempts to summarise the situation.

At some of the J3 meetings I have been at, we have had discussions over
whether the TR should allow the creation of descriptors that cannot be
created by Fortran mechanisms.  In no case did we reach a consensus, not
even among vendors or among consumers.

    5) There are some things that will almost certainly work and do not
break any Fortran rules, but are impossible in Fortran without using
sequence association and implicit copying, and without assuming
contiguity and using bounds remapping in pointer assignment.  These
include passing the diagonal of a square matrix and the sort of
reshaping that FFTs are so fond of.

    6) And there are some things that break some Fortran rules, but in a
way that is essentially required to work by other wording in the Fortran
standard.  In most cases, these are more definitely (if even less
clearly) required to work by the C standard.  These include treating the
real parts of a complex array as a real array, and the use of space
allocated as one type as another type (subject to various provisos).

My position is that I don't care where the boundaries are drawn,
provided that there ARE clear boundaries between defined, undefined and
processor dependent behaviour.  But I tried and failed to specify them
based on N1854, which is why I contributed to 11-168 and wrote 11-175.

If someone else can define such boundaries, then that proposal can
be discussed.


Edits to N1854
--------------

If 11-168 or 11-175 are rejected, all of problems (1)-(6) must be
resolved in some other way.
