DISCUSSION: 

In Fortran 2008, we have constraint C1238 which states "An actual arg-
ument that is a coindexed object with the ASYNCHRONOUS or VOLATILE 
attribute shall not correspond to a dummy argument that has either the 
ASYNCHRONOUS or the VOLATILE attribute."

In Fortran 2018, the corresponding constraint, C1538, was edited to 
state "An actual argument that is a coindexed object with the ASYNCH-
RONOUS or the VOLATILE attribute shall not correspond to a dummy 
argument that has either the ASYNCHRONOUS or VOLATILE attribute, unless
the dummy argument has the VALUE attribute." This implies an ASYNCHRON-
OUS or VOLATILE actual argument can become associated with a VOLATILE 
dummy argument so long as the dummy argument has the VALUE attribute.
However, we also have constraint C864 that states "An entity with the
VALUE attribute shall not have the ALLOCATABLE, INTENT (INOUT), INTENT 
(OUT), POINTER, or VOLATILE attributes."

It would be clearer to split C1538 into two constraints.  Edits are
provided to do this.

EDITS to 21-007r2:

15.5.2.5 Ordinary dummy arguments

322:35 (C1546) 
Delete "either" and "or VOLATILE" so the constraint reads
"An actual argument that is a coindexed object with the ASYNCHRONOUS or
VOLATILE attribute shall not correspond to a dummy argument that has 
the ASYNCHRONOUS attribute unless the dummy argument has the VALUE 
attribute."

322:36+ add new constraint
"C1546+ An actual argument that is a coindexed object with the ASYNCH-
RONOUS or VOLATILE attribute shall not correspond to a dummy argument 
that has the VOLATILE attribute."
