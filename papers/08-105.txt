From:    Van Snyder
Subject: Annex A, UTI 134
Date: 2008 January 21

[503:9-10]--------------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "The ability ... variable" by "In {\sc Fortran} 77 and
Fortran 90, a DO variable was allowed" Then insert "; this" before "has
been".

[503:14]----------------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Delete the comma after "77" and delete "for consistency also in"

[503:19]----------------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Delete the comma after "77" and delete "for consistency also in"

[503:24]----------------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "and also for consistency in" by ", and"

[503:30]----------------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Delete the comma after "77" and delete "for consistency also in"

[503:34]----------------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Insert "{\sc Fortran} 66," after "In" and replace "and also for
consistency in Fortran 90" by "Fortran 90, and Fortran 95"

[503:38+1-3]------------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Delete UTI 134

[504:7]-----------------------------------------------------------------
The features are not part of the current standard.  Editor: Replace
"work" by "worked"

[505:3]-----------------------------------------------------------------
Computed GO TO is reasonably efficient, and no less efficient than a
CASE construct.  Editor: Replace "more efficient" by "clearer"

[505:10-11]-------------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "of FORTRAN ... allowed" by "allow" since the same
"problem" exists in Fortran 2008.

[505:12]----------------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Insert a comma after "unnecessary".

[505:29]----------------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace the line "Fortran 90 had ... The" by
"In addition to the CHARACTER*<char-length> form introduced in {\sc
Fortran} 77, Fortran 90 provided the CHARACTER([LEN=]<type-param-value>)
form.  The"

[505:32]----------------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "allowed" by "allow" since the "problem" persists.

[505:34]----------------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Insert "usually" after "can"

[505:35+]---------------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Insert a note "In most cases the proposed solution is adequate,
but it is not thread safe."
