---------------------

J3 paper 06-184 proposed extending Fortran to allow the use of { } and
[ ] as alternatives to parentheses in expressions, and also the use of
^ instead of ** for raising to a power.

The use of [ ] for grouping terms of an expression conflicts with the
current use of [ ] as part of the syntax for array constructors. This
conflict is significant and would result in existing programs becoming
nonconforming. There is no current syntax usage for { } in Fortran.
In the past we have tried to reserve these symbols for future
uses. Such a future use might be the one suggested by 06-184, but we
are not ready to commit to this usage at this time. 

Other languages, including C, use the ^ operator for the exclusive or
operation.  Because of this, the use of ^ for Fortran's power
operation could be confusing, and this possibility seems to outweigh
the benefit.
