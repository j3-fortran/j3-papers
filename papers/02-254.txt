Date: 07 August 2002
From: Takata, Masayuki
To: INCITS/J3
Subject: Edits related to Japan's Interpretation Requests

Background:
J3 discussed Fortran 95 Interpretation Requests from Japan, at its meeting
#150, and classified the requests into four groups:
    "Fortran 95 Interpretation" - JOR subgroup will submit this item as a
         formal interpretation.
    "Recommended for Fortran 2000" - These items are problems, but they are
         not serious enough to warrant a formal Fortran 95 Interpretation.
    "Deferred to Editor" - J3 recommends that the editor of Fortran 2000
         include these changes into the text of the Fortran 2000 draft.
    "Not Recommended" - J3 believes that no action is required on these
         items.
Here are a list of edits for those items in the second and third classes
above that are, I believe, not yet addressed properly in the current draft.

====================================================================================
Part 1: Items recommended for Fortran 2000

JP-1)
[20:20] Insert "assignments" after "procedures,".

JP-5)
[66:5-7] Make the second sentence of this paragraph a new constraint C488
         (to R464) and move it to [65:24+].

NOTE: JP-5 is classified as a Fortran 95 Interpretation, and the approved
response to it suggests that the proposed edit take place in Fortran 2000,
not in Fortran 95.  That's because I include it here.  See below.

JP-13)
[89:32] Change "DO variables of the containing data-implied-dos" to
        "DO variables of this data-implied-do and the containing
        data-implied-dos".

JP-15)
[90:22] Change "list" to "expanded sequence".

JP-30)
[217:38] Change "input/output statement" to "input statement".

JP-34)
[240:6-8] Rewrite the paragraph to read:
         "The processor may begin new records as necessary, but the end
          of record shall not occur within a constant except for complex
          constants and character sequences.  The processor shall not
          insert blanks within a constant or character sequence."

          Check NAMELIST output in section 10.10.2.

JP-42)
[408:27] Delete "with a value that is not a statement label".


================================================================
Part 2: Items deferred to Editor

JP-19)
[126:5-6] Change "As the" to "The" twice.

JP-25)
[168:25] Delete "it specifies".

JP-41)
[274:30] Change "procedure" to "procedure name".

JP-45)
[430:31] Change "exponent range" to "range".

JP-48)
[477:26] Change "FLIP" to "FLIPS".

FYI: excerpt from WG5 N1473

NUMBER: JP-05
TITLE: Construction of array values
KEYWORDS: constructor
DEFECT TYPE: Interpretation
STATUS: Included in corrigendum/complete

QUESTION:

JP-5)

  4.5 Construction of array values,

  "The ac-do-variable of an ac-implied-do that is in another
   ac-implied-do shall not appear as the ac-do-variable of the
   containing ac-implied-do."

  This sentence should be a Constraint.

ANSWER:

No. The requirement should be made a constraint in the next standard. It should remain a simple requirement in Fortran 95 to avoid invalidating existing implementations.
