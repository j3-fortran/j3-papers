Introduction
------------
In 19.4p3 "Statement and construct entities", lines 12-14 read

"A variable that appears as an index-name in a FORALL
or DO CONCURRENT construct, as an associate-name
in a ASSOCIATE, SELECT RANK, SELECT TYPE construct,
or as a coarray-name in a codimension-decl in a CHANGE TEAM
construct is a construct entity."

"a ASSOCIATE" should be "an ASSOCIATE"?



Edit to 18-007r1
----------------

[500:13, 9.4p3 Statement and Construct Entities]

Replace "a ASSOCIATE"
with "an ASSOCIATE".

So the entire paragraph reads
"A variable that appears as an index-name in a
FORALL or DO CONCURRENT construct, as an
associate-name in an ASSOCIATE, SELECT RANK,
SELECT TYPE construct, or as a coarray-name
in a codimension-decl in a CHANGE TEAM construct
is a construct entity. A variable that has LOCAL
or LOCAL_INIT locality in a DO CONCURRENT construct
is a construct entity. An entity that is explicitly
declared in the specification part of a BLOCK
construct, other than only in ASYNCHRONOUS and
VOLATILE statements, is a construct entity. A USE
statement in a BLOCK construct explicitly declares
the entities accessed by use association to be
construct entities."
