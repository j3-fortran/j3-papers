1. Introduction
===============

This paper differs from the draft 06-014 as described in (new) section 3.

This contains the combined edits from all passed papers at meetings 173, 174
and 175, plus the "enhanced module" TR 19767 and the editor's report thereof
05-169 (the latter changes some edits and deletes others).

Some typos in the papers have been corrected in this list.
Some comments appear.

All edits appear in page and line number order.

There will not be a combined document with them separated out into
"feature" order; refer to the original papers for that information.

3. Recent Corrections
=====================

Thanks to Bill Long for most of these.

In the edit for [14:2,4,6], "<end-sep-subroutine-stmt>" should have been
"<end-sep-subprogram-stmt>".

In the edit for [15:2], the insertion of "<end-submodule-stmt>" was
missing an initial comma.

The edit for [37:41-44] is actually [37:31-34].

The edit for [53:5+] comes from paper 05-279.

In the edit for [53:5+], the BNF R446a omitted the non-pointer case of
component initialization, so it has been added back in.

In the edit for [53:5+], reworded constraint C452a to apply only when
<initial-data-target> appears (it doesn't make sense otherwise).

In the edit for [72:16+], changed "<initial-data-target> is specified" to
"<initial-data-target> appears", since it's a syntax term that appears.

In the edit for [71:20+], the BNF term is R503 not T503.

In the edit for [78:2-], item (8) started "an non-zero sized" instead of "a
nonzero-sized".  Also, (8c) had "array section order" instead of "array element
order".

In the edit for [80:35+], the BNF reference in constraint C544a is wrong - the
constraint applies to things outside the BNF rule.  There is no need for a BNF
reference on this rule and it is in fact harmful.  Removed.

In the edit for [111:21-23], there was a missing comma in a three-item list.

In the edit for [112:10+], there was a missing comma in a three-item list.

In the edit for [126:3-4], the last insertion ended with "," instead of ".".

In the edit for [138:12-13], "<expr>>" should be "<expr>".

In the edit for [138:12-13], inserted a new note to fix ambiguity of the two
<expr>s in the paragraphs following the insertion.

Added an editorial note to the edit for [138:15+], as it could be improved.

In the edit for [138:19-21], the location should have been [138:19-139:1].

Resolved the obvious conflict between 05-198r1 and 05-278r2 at [139:1].

In the edit for [139:18], the second replacement was missing "<>" around the
"assigned variable" replacement.

The edit for [144:36-38] inserts a new paragraph not replacing anything, and
should therefore have been at [144:38+].

Missing edit in 05-278r2 at [146:30].

Updated 05-237r3 edits to 05-237r4.

Resolved conflict between 05-237r4 and 05-205r2.

The "BLOCK" edit for [169:1-] is from paper 06-142.  Changed the syntax to
make the <specification-part> optional since the preceding text says "may
contain ...".  A BLOCK with no specs is useless, so maybe the reverse change
is what is required?  (viz "may contain" -> "contains")?

Again, in the "BLOCK" edit for [169:1-], rewrote the strange 2-element list
(with "(a)" and "(c)") into a single sentence.

In the edit for [170:26-27], it is the third sentence being deleted, not the
second.

Added missing edit 06-138r2 should have had at [421:43+].

In the edit for [183:32+], hyphenated "derived type" appropriately, and changed
  "value used to OPEN a file that is currently OPEN."
to
  "previous NEWUNIT value that identifies a file that is currently connected."
(because we never use OPEN in capital letters as a verb or state, every other
appearance is "OPEN statement".)

In the edit for [201:12], hyphenated "user defined derived type" appropriately,
and changed
 "the IOSTAT= specifier's <scalar-int-variable>"
to
 "any variable specified in an IOSTAT specifier"
(because there is not necessarily an IOSTAT= specifier ... there might only be
an ERR=... and it's an IOSTAT= specifier, and the new wording is copied
verbatim from several other occurrences in c09.)

Same edit, deleted
  "When an internal unit is used with an INQUIRE statement that contains
   neither an IOSTAT= specifier nor an ERR= specifier, execution of the program
   is terminated."
since it is not only redundant with the pre-existing [217:10-11], but because
termination is the expected result of any error condition in any i/o statement.
I'll put it back if people want, but surely this is overly redundant detail.

Edit for [218:26], added new edit
  After "processor-dependent positive integer value"
  Insert ", different from IOSTAT_INQUIRE_INTERNAL_UNIT,",
since otherwise IOSTAT_INQUIRE_INTERNAL_UNIT seems useless.

The edit for [225:22-] comes from paper 05-275r3.

In the description of [259:30+], "constraints"->"constraint" (only one is being
added).

In the edit [259:30+], fixed the constraint number and the BNF xref.

NOTE TO MALCOLM: DOUBLE-CHECK [259:30+].

In the edit [267:15-17], inserted missing comma.

Added paper ref to [269:14].

Clarified which paragraph to delete in [269:20-22].

Fixed "or" movement in [272:28-29].

Added wording improvement suggestion to [281:1].

Deleted edit for [281:3-4], noting that it was technically wrong.
(I deleted a whole lot of wrong edits from 06-143, this one slipped through.)

Inserted note to myself to rewrite [282:26] so it is the same as [281:1].

Deleted edit for [282:28-29] as it was another wrong one.

Fixed a typo in [283:1-] "<...<" -> "<...>".

Fixed context in [286:31].

   either has the SAVE attribute or is declared in the main program, does not
   have the ALLOCATABLE attribute, and every subscript, section subscript,
   substring starting point, and substring ending point in the variable is an
   initialization expression.

   If <initial-data-target> appears for a data pointer component, that
   component in any object of the type is initially associated with the target
   or becomes associated with the target as specified in 16.4.2.1.1.

   If <initial-proc-target> appears in <proc-decl> for a procedure pointer
   component, that component in any object of the type is initially associated
   with the target or becomes associated with the target as specified in
   16.4.2.1.1.".

05-273r3:
[78:2-] After 5.1.2.4 BIND attribute for data entities, add a new subclause
 "5.1.2.4a  CONTIGUOUS attribute

  The <<CONTIGUOUS attribute>> specifies that an entity is contiguous.

  An object is <<contiguous>> if it is not the real or imaginary part of an
  array of type complex, and is:
    (1) an object with the CONTIGUOUS attribute,
    (2) a scalar object,
    (3) a nonpointer array that is not assumed-shape,
    (4) an array allocated by an ALLOCATE statement,
    (5) an assumed-shape array that is argument associated with an array
        that is contiguous,
    (6) a pointer associated with a contiguous target,
    (7) an array with at most one element, or
    (8) a nonzero-sized array section (6.2.2) with the following
        properties:
          (a) Its base object is contiguous.
          (b) It does not have a vector subscript.
          (c) The elements of the section, in array element order, are a subset
              of the base object elements that are consecutive in array element
              order.
          (d) If the array is of type character and a <substring-range>
              appears, the <substring-range> specifies all of the
              characters of the <parent-string> (6.1.1).
          (e) Only its final <part-ref> has nonzero rank.

  An object is not contiguous if it is an array subobject, and
   (1) the object has two or more elements,
   (2) the elements of the object in array element order are not consecutive in
       the elements of the base object,
   (3) the object is not of type character with length zero, and
   (4) the object is not of a derived type that has no ultimate components
       other than zero-sized arrays and characters with length zero.

  It is processor-dependent whether any other object is contiguous.

  Note 5.10a

  If a derived type has only one component that is not zero-sized, it is
  processor-dependent whether a structure component of a contiguous array of
  that type is contiguous.  That is, the derived type might contain padding on
  some processors.

  [end Note]

  Note 5.10b

  The CONTIGUOUS attribute allows a processor to enable optimizations that
  depend on the memory layout of the object occupying a contiguous block
  of memory.  Examples of CONTIGUOUS attribute specifications are:

   REAL, POINTER, CONTIGUOUS        :: SPTR(:)
   REAL, CONTIGUOUS, DIMENSION(:,:) :: D

  "8.1.6.4a Restrictions on DO CONCURRENT constructs

   A statement in the loop range shall not cause a branch out of the construct.

   A variable that is referenced in an iteration shall either be previously
   defined during that iteration, or shall be defined or become undefined
   during any other iteration of the current execution of the construct.  A
   variable that is defined or becomes undefined by more than one iteration of
   the current execution of the construct becomes undefined when the current
   execution of the construct terminates.

   A pointer that is referenced in an iteration either shall be previously
   pointer associated during that iteration, or shall not have its pointer
   association changed during any iteration. A pointer that has its pointer
   association changed in more than one iteration has a processor dependent
   association status when the construct terminates.

   An allocatable object that is allocated in more than one iteration shall be
   subsequently deallocated during the same iteration in which it was
   allocated. An object that is allocated or deallocated in only one iteration
   shall not be deallocated, allocated, referenced, defined, or become
   undefined in a different iteration.

   An input/output statement shall not write data to a file record or position
   in one iteration and read from the same record or position in a different
   iteration of the same execution of the construct.

   Records written by output statements in the loop range to a sequential
   access file appear in the file in an indeterminate order.

   Procedures referenced in the loop range shall be PURE.  If the
   IEEE_EXCEPTIONS intrinsic module is accessible, calls to the IEEE_GET_FLAG,
   IEEE_SET_HALTING_MODE, and IEEE_GET_HALTING_MODE subroutines shall not
   appear in the loop range.

   Note 8.15a
   The restrictions on referencing variables defined in an iteration of a DO
   CONCURRENT construct apply to any procedure invoked within the loop.
   [end Note]

   Note 8.15b
   The restrictions on the statements in the loop range of a DO CONCURRENT
   construct are designed to ensure there are no data dependencies between
   iterations of the loop.  This permits code optimizations that might
   otherwise be difficult or impossible because they would depend on
   characteristics of the program not visible to the compiler.
   [end Note]"

05-237r4:
[169:1--] 8.1.6.5 Examples of DO constructs, after Note 8.18, add a new note:
  "Note 8.18a
   The following example represents a case in which the user knows that
   the elements of the array IND form a permutation of the integers 1..N.
   The DO CONCURRENT construct will allow the compiler to generate vector
   gather/scatter code, unroll the loop, or parallelize the code for this
   loop, significantly improving performance.

   INTEGER :: A(N,N),IND(N)

        within that construct; otherwise, it shall be within the range of at
        least one <do-construct>.

   An EXIT statement belongs to a particular construct.  If the EXIT
   statement refers to a construct name, it belongs to that construct;
   otherwise, it belongs to the innermost DO construct in which it appears.

   C829a (R844) An <exit-stmt> shall not belong to a DO CONCURRENT construct,
         nor shall it appear within the range of a DO CONCURRENT construct if
         it belongs to a construct that contains that DO CONCURRENT construct.

   When an EXIT statement that belongs to a DO construct is executed, it
   terminates the loop (8.1.6.4.4) and any active loops contained within the
   terminated loop.  When an EXIT statement that belongs to a non-DO construct
   is executed, it terminates any active loops contained within that construct,
   and completes execution of that construct."
NOTES: (1) To do this without 05-237r4, omit constraint C829a.

   module procedure <<correspond>> if they have the same name, and the module
   procedure interface is declared in the same program unit as the subprogram
   or is declared in an ancestor of the program unit in which the procedure is
   defined and is accessible by host association from that ancestor.  A module
   procedure interface body shall not correspond to more than one subprogram
   that defines a separate module procedure.

   Note 12.40a
   A separate module procedure can be accessed by use association if and only
   if its interface body is declared in the specification part of a module and
   is public.
   {end note}

   If a procedure is defined by a <separate-module-subprogram>, its
   characteristics are specified by the corresponding module procedure
   interface body.

   If a separate module procedure is a function defined by a
   <separate-module-subprogram>, the result variable name is determined by the
   FUNCTION statement in the module procedure interface body.  Otherwise, the
   result variable name is determined by the FUNCTION statement in the module
   subprogram.

                      condition occurs but WAIT is present with the value false
                      and the processor does not support asynchronous
                      execution.  Otherwise it is assigned the value 0.
  CMDMSG (optional)   shall be of type default character and shall be a scalar.
                      It is an INTENT(INOUT) argument.  If an error condition
