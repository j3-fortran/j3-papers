1. Discussion

Any user procedure invoked by a restricted expression has to be pure
(see p5, at the top of page 165) and so C1583 which requires evaluation
of a pure function never to invoke an impure finalizer means the condition
is impossible to violate.

2. Response to GB-011

Accepted as is.

3. Edits to N2146

Page 164, 10.1.11 Specification expression, p3 [actually a continuation
of p2], delete ", and where any final subroutine that is invoked is pure".
