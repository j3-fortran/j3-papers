Subject: Atomic compare-and-swap
Date: 2012 June 27

Discussion:
---------

N1930 requirement 4 adds five new atomic subroutines to the Coarray
TS. This paper provides semantics and edits for the Atomic Compare and
Swap routine.


Semantics:
----------

The operation of the compare and swap intrinsic:

   atomic_cas (atom, old, compare, new)

is to perform atomically:

   old = atom
   if (old == compare) atom  = new



Edits:
---------

In the TS Clause for new intrinsic procedures, add this subsubclause in the
subclause on Atomic Subroutines alphabetically by routine name.

" 4.x.y ATOMIC_CAS (ATOM, OLD, COMPARE, NEW)

 Description. Conditionally swap values atomically.

 Class.  Atomic subroutine.

 Arguments.

 ATOM shall be scalar and of type integer with kind ATOMIC_INT_KIND or
           of type logical with kind ATOMIC_LOGICAL_KIND, where
           ATOMIC_INT_KIND and ATOMIC_LOGICAL_KIND are the named
           constants in the intrinsic module ISO_FORTRAN_ENV. It is an
           INTENT (INOUT) argument. If the value of ATOM is equal to
           the value of COMPARE, ATOM becomes defined with the value
           of INT (NEW, ATOMIC_INT_KIND) if it is of type integer, and
           with the value of NEW if it of type logical.


 OLD shall be scalar and of the same type as ATOM. It is an INTENT
           (OUT) argument. It becomes defined with the value of INT
           (ATOMC, KIND (OLD)) if ATOM is of type integer, and the
           value of ATOMC if ATOM is of type logical, where ATOMC has
           the same type and KIND as ATOM and has the value of ATOM
           used for the compare operation.

 COMPARE  shall be scalar and of the same type and kind as ATOM.
          It is an INTENT(IN) argument.

 NEW      shall be scalar and of the same type as ATOM. It is an
          INTENT(IN) argument.


 Example. CALL ATOMIC_CAS(I[3], OLD, Z, 1) causes I on image 3 to
          become defined with the value 1 if its value is that of Z,
          and OLD to become defined with the value of I on image 3
          prior to the comparison."


In the Edits clause of the TS, in the subclause for edits to Clause
13, add

---------------------------

'[323:Table13.1] In Table 13.1 Standard generic intrinsic procedure
summary, add a new entry

"ATOMIC_CAS (ATOM, OLD, COMPARE, NEW) A Conditionally swap values
atomically."'

---------------------------

In the Edits clause of the TS, in the subclause for edits to Clause
13, add

"Move the description of ATOMIC_CAS from 4.x.y in this Technical
Specification to Clause 13 of \Fortranstandard{} in order
alphabetically."
