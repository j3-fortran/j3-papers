Title:                Q Edit Descriptor (Input Character Count Editing)

Submitted By:    Craig Dedo

Status:            For Consideration

Basic Functionality:
    The Fortran standard should support the Q edit descriptor, as
implemented as an extension in several Fortran compilers.  This edit
descriptor obtains the number of characters remaining in the current
input record.

Rationale:
    It is often very useful to obtain a count of the remaining
characters in an input record, right in the middle of the input record.
The support for the Q edit descriptors an extension in the CVF, IBM,
Lahey, and Sun compilers attests to the popularity and usefulness of
this feature.

Estimated Impact:
    Since this is a popular extension, the algorithms are well known.
Therefore, it should be fairly inexpensive to implement this feature.

Detailed Specification:
    On input, if a Q edit descriptor corresponds to a scalar integer
variable, the integer variable is set to the number of characters
remaining in the input record.  If the corresponding input variable is
some other data type, an error occurs.  On output, the corresponding
output list element is ignored.
