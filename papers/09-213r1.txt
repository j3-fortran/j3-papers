Subject: STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE and C's exit()

The current standard requires SYNC ALL and SYNC IMAGES statements with
the STAT= specifier to return with a status of STAT_STOPPED_IMAGE if
another image has initiated a normal termination.  This seems reasonable
except it includes the normal terminations initiated by a C's exit()
function.  A Fortran implementation on SYNC ALL and SYNC IMAGES in general
can not understand the termination from a C's exit function call.
Therefore the exit() function from C should be excluded from the list of
normal terminations that is listed in 8.5.7.

EDITS:

[196:5] 8.5.7 STAT= and ERRMSG= specifiers in image control statements,
change 
   "an image that has initiated termination" 
to
   "an image that has initiated a termination other than by 
   executing the C exit() function".
         
[196:8] 8.5.7 STAT= and ERRMSG= specifiers in image control statements,
after the first sentence of para 2 add
   "Whether this is also the effect when termination is initiated by 
   executing the C exit() function is processor dependent."

[196:10+] 8.5.7 STAT= and ERRMSG= specifiers in image control statements,
    after para 2, add
   "NOTE 8.43+
   It is desirable that implementations do not distinguish between normal
   terminations that do or do not arise from executing the C exit() 
   function."

[464:21+] A.2 Processor Dependencies, add extra bullet point
    "o the effect of executing a SYNC ALL or SYNC IMAGES statement with
       a STAT= specifier if it involves synchronization with an image 
       that has executed the C exit() function (8.5.7)."
