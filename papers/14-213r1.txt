EVENT WAIT is still seriously ambiguous about how many segments must
precede it, and the provision of EVENT_QUERY makes it almost certain
that this will cause trouble.  This issue was raised in N1999 and
N2007, and has still not been addressed.  Edits are provided to
resolve the ambiguity.

EDITS to N2007
--------------

[16:13-16] 6.4 EVENT WAIT paragraph 3, replace the paragraph by

    "If an EVENT WAIT statement using an event variable is executed
    with a threshold of $k$, the segments preceding at least $k$ EVENT
    POST statements using that event variable will precede the segment
    following the EVENT WAIT statement. The segment following a
    different EVENT WAIT statement using the same event variable can
    be ordered to succeed segments preceding other EVENT POST
    statements using that event variable."
