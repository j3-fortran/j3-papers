Subject: Incomplete constraint in CRITICAL
Date: 2009/05/07


Constraint C810 is not statically checkable, because it is not always
possible to tell if a statement is an image control statement.  In
addition, the image control statement may occur inside a subroutine
whose code is not known to the compiler.

There is also an oversight in that branching out of a CRITICAL
construct should be forbidden.

Edits are provided to correct these problems.

Edits:
======

[130:15] Change the first sentence of p4 to:
  "When an ALLOCATE statement is executed for which an <allocate-object>
   is a coarray, there is implicit synchronization of all images."

[133:16] Replace the first sentence of p11 with:
  "When a DEALLOCATE statement is executed for which an <allocate-object>
   is a coarray, there is implicit synchronization of all images."

[174:18] In C810, before "an image control statement"
         insert "a RETURN statement or".

[174:18+] Insert new constraint
  "C810a A statement that branches from the block of a <critical-construct>
         to outside the <critical-construct> is not permitted."
{The CYCLE and EXIT statement do "internal branching" (see 2.3.5, though it
 is not particularly clearly specified).}

[174:18+] In 8.1.5, append to p2:
  "A procedure invoked, directly or indirectly, from a CRITICAL construct
   shall not execute an image control statement."

[189:23] Replace the fourth bullet item with:
  "ALLOCATE or DEALLOCATE statement that has a coarray <allocate-object>;".
