0. Disposition by /JATA

/JATA mostly agrees with the positions in this paper.  Look for /JATA
below to find comments other than "we agree."  Edits are in paper
14-121r1.

1. Introduction

This paper contains suggested editorial changes and technical fixes to
14-007.

Sections 2 and 3 list and discuss the editorial and technical issues.

Section 4 contains edits to address those items.

Section 5 is requesting subgroup and/or committee feedback before trying
to address an editorial issue.  (Individual edits are not required to
fix this, global edits or licence would be better ... once direction is
established.)

Finally, section 6 is asking a technical question that perhaps should be
dealt with via a technical fix (for F2015) or an interpretation request.


2. Editorial changes (some of which are fixes)

(a) "An \termi{allocatable} object that is allocated in more than one
     iteration shall be subsequently deallocated during the same iteration
     in which it was allocated."
    has number disagreement "more than one iteration" vs. "the same
    iteration".  This needs rewording.

    There is also the question that if an object is allocated more than
    once in an iteration, which allocation does the deallocation need to
    come after?  Obviously there needs to be a deallocation for every
    allocation, but it might be better to say it should end that
    iteration with an allocation status of deallocated?  But only if
    those words are clearer than merely fixing the existing words. NOTE:
    This is the ALTERNATIVE FIX in the edits below.

(b) "9.5.6.14 POSITION= specifier in the OPEN statement
     ...  ASIS leaves the position unspecified if the file exists but is
     not connected.  ..."
    "Not specified" means the standard does not establish an
    interpretation and that therefore such a program would not be
    conforming.  This is certainly not what we intended!  This should
    say "processor dependent" and be noted in Annex A.

    I am classifying this as editorial since it is plainly obvious we
    did not actually mean what the words say.  But it is a fix, not a
    mere "change".

(c) "...if that scoping unit contains a module subprogram, internal
     subprogram, or statement function that defines a procedure ..."
    should say "statement function statement" since it is talking about
    the syntax....i.e. the statement function ***IS*** the procedure, it
    is the statement function statement that defines it.

(d) "If a procedure-name appears in the end-mp-subprogram-stmt, it shall be
     identical to the procedure-name in the MODULE PROCEDURE statement."
    should say "... in the mp-subprogram-stmt" i.e. use all syntax
    terms, especially to avoid confusion with those familiar with F90/95
    where the MODULE PROCEDURE statement was a horse of a different
    colour.

(e) "A defined input/output procedure may use a FORMAT with a DT edit
     descriptor",
    in this, "FORMAT" should be "format specification", since it might
    be a character format-spec.

(f) List of statements that "may" (sic) perform "wait operations" is
    different in "Wait operation" and "WAIT statement".  Also "may"
    should be one of "do", "can", or "might", depending on whether we
    want to express actuality, capability, or possibility.

    9.7.1 "Wait operation" says
       WAIT, INQUIRE, FLUSH, CLOSE, data transfer, or file positioning
    NOTE 9.5.1 in 9.7.2 "WAIT statement" (on the very same page!) says
       CLOSE, INQUIRE and file positioning

    Looking at the text for FLUSH, it is the note that is defective and
    therefore we can fix this by deleting the unnecesarily redundant and
    misleading note.

    It would also be nice to put the list in sort-of alphabetic order,
    at least for the named statements.

    Also, it might (or might not) be better either to put the whole list
    into alphabetic order, or to do that while changing "data transfer"
    and "file positioning" into the statements they actually refer to.
    NOTE: See ALTERNATIVE CHANGE and SECOND ALTERNATIVE CHANGE edits
    below.

(g) In "Statement functions",
      "Each dummy argument has the same type and type parameters as the
       entity of the same name in the scoping unit containing the statement
       function."
    after "statement function" insert "statement", since a scoping unit
    is a piece of syntax and therefore cannot contain a procedure (but
    can contain a statement or definition).
    NB: Although "statement function definition" would also be
        acceptable, since it is a statement I would prefer to have this
        uniformly referred to as such and indexed as such.

(h) List of statements that "may refer to a file that does not exist"
    should be alphabetic.

    Also "also may refer" would be better as "is permitted to refer" to
    make it easier to understand.  I hope the prohibitions on statements
    not on this list from referring to nonexistent files appear
    elsewhere (not checked!).  IF there is no prohibition elsewhere, we
    probably need an extra edit, e.g. inserting after the text in
    question
      "No other statement shall refer to a file that does not exist.".

/JATA=====================================================================
We could not find such a prohibition.  An edit is provided paper
14-121r1 to address this.
/JATA=====================================================================

(i) The current wording of C533 is slightly defective, as it does not
    clearly prohibit "REAL,DIMENSION(*) :: dummy,nondummy", seeing as
    how that does indeed declare "the array bounds of a dummy data
    object".  C533 should probably be reworded similarly to C534a.

/JATA=====================================================================
F08/0086 appears to address this problem.  C535 in 14-007 appears to
work correctly, at least for the rank-one assumed-size dummy argument
case.  C533 now refers to <assumed-size-spec>, not
<assumed-implied-spec>.  No edits appear to be needed, at least to
address the rank-one assumed-size dummy argument case.  There might
still be a problem with higher-rank cases, e.g.
                  REAL,DIMENSION(10,*) :: dummy,nondummy
/JATA=====================================================================

3. Technical fixes

These are numbered not lettered, for uniqueness.

(1) "Reinhold has pointed out a problem with the Corr 2 edits to
     MOVE_ALLOC.  We failed to make this edit:
     [372:24] 13.7.118 MOVE_ALLOC, para 4, after "array bounds,"
              add "array cobounds,"."

     Those words don't work.  Proposed edit has different words.

(2) Apparently, "CODIMENSION X[*]" in an inner scoping unit does not
    block host association so refers to the entity in the outer scoping
    unit. We obviously did NOT mean that: when we do mean that we always
    make an explicit statement of the semantics, so this is an obvious
    oversight. 10-007r1[444+9+] In 16.5.1.4 Host association, para 2,
    add item to list:
                       (5a) a coarray-name in a codimension-stmt,

    Those edits work, but I marginally prefer codimension to precede
    dimension rather than follow it (the rest of the list is not in any
    particular order so it is not a big deal though).

    Technically this would appear to be an incompatibility with F2008,
    however since we do not explicitly state the semantics of a
    CODIMENSION statement that does not block host association, unlike
    the situation with ASYNCHRONOUS and VOLATILE, we can weasel that it
    is not really incompatible.  If the weaselling is not considered
    sufficient we need an edit in Clause 1 to note the incompatibility.

4. Edits to 14-007

[98:8-9] 5.3.8.5 Assumed-size array, C533,
         replace
           "An <assumed-size-spec> shall not appear except as the
            declaration of the array bounds of"
         with
           "An object whose array bounds are specified by an
            <assumed-size-spec> shall be".
{EDITORIAL FIX (i).}

[179:28] 8.1.6.6 Restrictions on DO CONCURRENT constructs, p1,
         bullet item "An allocatable object...",
         after "shall be subsequently deallocated during"
         change "the same iteration" to "each iteration".
{EDITORIAL FIX (a).}
ALTERNATIVE FIX:
         Replace entire first sentence with
  "If an allocatable object is allocated in more than one iteration, it
   shall have an allocation status of unallocated at the end of every
   iteration.".

/JATA=====================================================================
J3 prefers the alternative, with "deallocated" replaced by "unallocated".
/JATA=====================================================================

[201:3-4] 9.3.2 File existence, p3, change
            "An INQUIRE ... also may refer"
          to
            "A CLOSE, ENDFILE, FLUSH, INQUIRE, OPEN, PRINT, REWIND, or
             WRITE statement is permitted to refer".
{EDITORIAL CHANGE (h).}

/JATA=====================================================================
An edit in paper 14-121r1 prohibits other statements from referring to
files that do not exist.

WAIT is allowed to refer to a unit that does not exist, while FLUSH is
allowed to refer to a unit that is connected to a file that does not
exist.  We cannot think of a reason that WAIT should be allowed to refer
to a unit that does not exist, but not to a unit that is connected to a
file that does not exist.  J3 agrees this is a problem but has not acted.

There should be an explicit prohibition against other statements
referring to files that do not exist.  There should also be an explicit
prohibition at [14-007:207:21-22] against statements not in the list
referring to units that do not exist.

Edits are provided paper 14-121r1.
/JATA=====================================================================

[211:36-38] 9.5.6.14 POSITION= specifier in the OPEN statement,
            change sentence "ASIS leaves ... not connected." to
  "If the file exists but is not connected, the position resulting from
   ASIS is processor-dependent.".
{EDITORIAL FIX (b), part 1.}

[229:13] 9.6.4.8.3 Defined input/output procedures, p24,
         between "procedure may use a" and "with a DT edit descriptor",
         change "FORMAT" to "format specification".
         Also hyperlink "DT edit descriptor"
         to "10.7.6 User-defined derived-type editing".
{EDITORIAL FIX (e).}

[232:15-16] 9.7.1 Wait operation, p1,
            "WAIT, INQUIRE, FLUSH, CLOSE,"
            -> "CLOSE, FLUSH, INQUIRE, WAIT,".
{EDITORIAL CHANGE (a), part 1.}
ALTERNATIVE CHANGE:
            "WAIT, INQUIRE, FLUSH, CLOSE, data transfer, or file
             positioning"
            -> "CLOSE, data transfer, file positioning, FLUSH, INQUIRE,
                or WAIT"
SECOND ALTERNATIVE CHANGE:
            "WAIT, INQUIRE, FLUSH, CLOSE, data transfer, or file
             positioning"
            -> "BACKSPACE, CLOSE, ENDFILE, FLUSH, INQUIRE, PRINT, READ,
                REWIND, WAIT, or WRITE".
/JATA=====================================================================
J3 prefers the second alternative.
/JATA=====================================================================

[232:29+1-2] 9.7.2 WAIT statement, NOTE 9.51, delete entire NOTE.
{EDITORIAL FIX (f).}

[306:26] 12.5.5.1 Establishment of procedure names, p3, item (1),
         between "statement function" and "that defines a procedure"
         insert "statement".
{EDITORIAL FIX (c).}

/JATA=====================================================================
Make sure to insert in \obs font.
/JATA=====================================================================

[312:30] 12.6.2.5 Separate module procedures, C1269,
         "the MODULE PROCEDURE statement" -> "the <mp-subprogram-stmt>".
{EDITORIAL CHANGE (d).}

[315:15] 12.6.4 Statement function, p3,
         between "containing the statement function" and "."
         insert "statement".
{EDITORIAL FIX (g).}

/JATA=====================================================================
Make sure to insert in \obs font.
/JATA=====================================================================

[376:8] 13.7.118 MOVE_ALLOC, p4,
        "array bounds," -> "bounds, cobounds,",
        and hyperlink "type parameters", "bounds", and "cobounds"
        to the defined term.
{TECHNICAL FIX (1).}

[450:20+] 16.5.1.4 Host association, p2, after list item (4)
          which ends "<parameter-stmt>", insert new item
          "(4a) a <coarray-name> in a <codimension-stmt>,".
{TECHNICAL FIX (2).}

[467:24+] A.2 Processor Dependencies,
          before bullet item "the default value for the RECL="
          insert new bullet item
  "the position of a file after executing an OPEN statement with a
   POSITION= specifier of ASIS, when the file previously existed but was
   not connected (9.5.6.14);".
/JATA=====================================================================
J3 noted and repaired two typos here ("statment" and "specifer").
/JATA=====================================================================

{EDITORIAL FIX (b), part 2.
 9.5.6.14 is "POSITION= specifier in the OPEN statement".}


5. Terminological consistency

We variously refer to a data transfer statement as
   "input/output statements"
   "input statement"
   "output statement"
   "data transfer statement"
   "data transfer input statement"
   "data transfer output statement"
   "data transfer input/output statement"
   "READ statement"
and probably many others.  Also "input/output statements" is sometimes
used to mean "all i/o-related statements including OPEN etc" and
sometimes used to mean only "data transfer statements".

I am sympathetic to "input" and "output" when only talking about READ or
WRITE/PRINT, but the variety is not helpful either for the reader or
indeed for indexing.  We should reduce this number, preferably to three
versions, perhaps
  "input statement" when talking about input only
  "output statement" when talking about output only
  "data transfer statement" when talking about input and output
and everywhere "input statement" appears it should be indexed as "data
transfer statement", ditto "output statement".

And "input/output statements" can still be used when it means all i/o
statements.

As it is, I did not index "input statement" or "output statement" at all.
This really does need to be fixed once we decide what terminology we will
use.

/JATA=====================================================================
J3 agrees that the plethora of inconsistent terminology should be
replaced by the simplified terminology advocated here.
/JATA=====================================================================

6. Technical question

I wondered why we did not just say that any i/o statement could perform
a wait operation.  Apparently an OPEN statement cannot perform a wait
operation.  Even an OPEN statement changing one of the changeable modes
of the connection?  It seems unlikely it could do that without waiting
for pending asynchronous data transfer operations to complete,

/JATA=====================================================================
An OPEN statement for a file connected to the specified unit should do a
WAIT operation.  Edits are provided paper 14-121r1.  J3 did not consider
the question whether it would be better simply to say that any
input/output statement other than an asynchronous data-transfer
statement performs a wait operation.
/JATA=====================================================================

And since an OPEN statement for a different file will CLOSE the current
connection, presumably that will do a wait operation and therefore might
return an IOSTAT= value corresponding to the operation being waited on
rather than the CLOSE as such?

Does this deserve a quick technical fix or an interpretation?

/JATA=====================================================================
An interpretation appears to be needed.

An OPEN statement for a connected unit that specifies a file different
from the file currently connected is explicitly specified by 9.5.6.1p4
to perform a CLOSE operation as if by execution of a CLOSE statement.  A
CLOSE statement explicitly performs a WAIT operation.  No edits are
required concerning the WAIT operation.  It is not clear whether the
OPEN statement is considered to have failed to execute if execution of
the CLOSE operation encounters an error condition during a wait
operation, or during the close operation proper, if an IOSTAT specifier
appears, and then the OPEN operation succeeds.  If the OPEN statement is
considered to have failed in this case, the IOSTAT and ERMSG variable
values should be set as if by a CLOSE statement.  If the OPEN statement
is considered to have succeeded, the IOSTAT variable should be set to
zero, and the ERMSG variable should not be changed.

There is a similar problem with a CLOSE statement:  If it performs a
wait operation, and an error occurs during the wait operation, should
the CLOSE statement fail, and if so, should it be required that the
IOSTAT value be the same as would have been reported by a WAIT
statement?
