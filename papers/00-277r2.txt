Subject:    Edits for Destructors

1. Introduction

This paper contains edits to implement the syntax and specifications of
destructors as described in 00-271.

2. Organisation and Terminology

The terminology we'll use should be clear from 00-271:
  "finalization"
     - whatever it is that we do immediately before destroying a derived-type
       object (either calling a user procedure or not).
  "final subroutines"
     - the user-defined procedures that get called before object destruction.
  "finalizable"
     - a type (or object) needs finalization.

Most of this will go into chapter 4 (for derived types), since they only
apply to derived types.

3. Specs and Syntax Changes and Clarifications

The following additional requirements on user-defined final subroutines are
proposed:

(1) All nonkind type parameters of the dummy argument shall be assumed.
    - Rationale: It seems desirable to require the finalizer not to have a
      runtime check before being called or to have potential runtime
      non-conformance.
(2) The dummy argument shall not be INTENT(OUT).
    - RAT: This would automatically cause an infinite loop, which is
      undesirable.
(3) An extended derived type is also finalisable if it extends a finalisable
    type (c.f. first sentence of 3.1 in 00-271).
(4) Multiple FINAL statements in a derived type definition are treated as if
    they were concatenated.
(5) The dummy argument of a final subroutine shall not have the OPTIONAL
    attribute.
    - RAT: Since a final subroutine is always called (by the processor) with an
      argument, it would seem confusing to have it being optional; that is
      most likely to be some sort of user error.
(6) If a component of a finalizable object is allocatable, the object shall be
    finalized before any automatic deallocation of the component.
(7) Values from constructors are finalized after use.
(8) Revised 3.3
    A finalisable object is not finalised by returning from a subprogram:
    - if it has the SAVE attribute
    - if it occurs in the main program
    - if it is defined in a module and if the processor retains its definition
      status (and thus value) even when there is no active procedure
      referencing the module.
    A finalisable object is not finalised:
    - on termination of the program by a STOP statement or an
      <end-program-stmt>
    - on termination of the program by some error (e.g. an allocation error or
      an i/o error)

               be present."
{Prevent all type-bound procedures, including final subroutines, from appearing
 in sequence types.}

[43:28+] Insert constraints
  "Constraint: <final-subroutine-name> shall be a module procedure with
               exactly one dummy argument.  That argument shall be a
               nonpointer nonallocatable nonpolymorphic nonoptional variable of
               the derived type being defined.  All nonkind type parameters
               of the dummy argument shall be assumed.  The dummy argument
               shall not be INTENT(OUT).

   Constraint: A <final-subroutine-name> shall not be one that previously had
               been specified as a final subroutine in that type.

{Add syntax for user to declare final subroutines.
 The final constraint requires the final subroutines to be generically

 set.}

[50:44+] Insert new section
  "4.5.1.8a Final subroutines

{NOTE TO EDITOR: Please insert "final subroutines" into the index.}
   The FINAL keyword specifies a list of <<final subroutines>>.  These
   subroutines may be executed when an object of that type is finalized
   (4.5.7a).

   A derived type is <<finalizable>> if it has any final subroutines, or if
   it has any nonpointer nonallocatable component whose type is finalizable.
   An object is finalizable if its type is finalizable.

   Note 4.38a:
   Final subroutines are effectively always "accessible".  They are called
   for object finalization regardless of the accessibility of the type, its
   other type-bound procedure bindings, or the subroutine name itself.

   Note 4.38b:
   Final subroutines are not inherited through type extension and cannot be
   overridden.  The final subroutines of the parent type are called
   after calling any additional final subroutines of an extended type.
"
{Basic definitions.}

[52:40] Before "procedure bindings" insert "non-final".
{Final procedure bindings are not inherited.}

[57:12+] Insert new section
  "4.5.7a The finalization process

{NOTE TO EDITOR: Please insert "finalization" into the index.}

   When a finalizable object is <<finalized>>, the following steps are carried
   out in sequence:
     (1) If the dynamic type of the object has a final subroutine whose dummy
         argument has the same kind type parameters and rank as the object
	 being finalized, it is called with the object as an actual argument.
         If there is no such subroutine, but there is an elemental final
         subroutine with the same kind type parameters as the object being
         finalized, it is called with the object as an actual argument.  If no
         final subroutine fulfills these requirements, no subroutine is called
         at this point.
     (2) Each finalizable component that appears in the type definition is
         finalized.
{NOTE TO J3, NOT THE STANDARD: This excludes inherited components.
 Alternative wording would be "Each finalizable non-inherited component is..."}
         If the object is an array, the components of each element are
         finalized separately.
{NOTE TO J3, NOT THE STANDARD: This will finalize zero components if the array
 is zero-sized.}
     (3) If the object is of extended type and the parent type is finalizable,
         the parent component is finalized.

   If several objects are to be finalized at the same time, the order in which
   they are finalized is processor-dependent.  A final subroutine shall not
   reference or define an object that has already been finalized.

   4.5.7b When finalization occurs

   A pointer or allocatable object is finalized when it is deallocated.

   A nonpointer nonallocatable object that is not a dummy argument or function
   result is finalized immediately before it would become undefined due to
   execution of a RETURN or END statement (14.7.6, item (3)).  If the object is
   defined in a module and there are no longer any active procedures
   referencing the module, it is processor-dependent whether it is finalized.
   If the object is not finalized, it retains its definition status and does
   not become undefined.

   If an executable construct references a function whose result is
   finalizable, the result is finalized after execution of the innermost
   executable construct containing the reference.
{NOTE TO J3, NOT THE STANDARD: An ordinary executable statement - such as an
 assignment statement - is in itself an executable construct.)

   If an executable construct references a structure constructor for a
   finalizable type, the object created by the structure constructor is
   finalized after execution of the innermost executable construct containing
   the reference.

   If a specification expression in a scoping unit references a function whose
   result is finalizable, the result is finalized before execution of the first
   executable statement in the scoping unit.

   When a procedure is invoked, a nonpointer nonallocatable object that is an
   actual argument associated with an INTENT(OUT) dummy argument is finalized.

   When an intrinsic assignment statement is executed, the <variable> is
   finalized after evaluation of the <expr> and before the definition of the
   <variable>.

{EDITOR: BEGIN NOTE}
   Note 4.49a
   The semantics of intrinsic assignment are such that finalization has very
   limited usefulness.  Defined assignment will almost always be necessary for
   finalization to be useful.
{EDITOR: END NOTE}

   If an object is allocated via pointer allocation and later becomes
   unreachable due to all pointers to that object having their pointer
   association status changed, it is processor dependent whether it is
   finalized.  If it is finalized, it is processor dependent as to when
   the final subroutines are called.

   4.5.7c Objects that are not finalized

   If program execution is terminated, either by an error (e.g. an allocation
   failure) or by execution of a STOP or END PROGRAM statement, no objects
   existing immediately prior to termination are finalized.

{EDITOR: BEGIN NOTE}
   Note 4.49b
   A nonpointer nonallocatable object that has the SAVE attribute or which
   occurs in the main program is never finalized as a direct consequence of
   the execution of a RETURN or END statement.

   A variable in a module is not finalized if it retains its definition
   status and value, even when there is no active procedure referencing
   the module.
{EDITOR: END NOTE}"

[107:35+] Insert new paragraph
  "If an allocatable component is a subobject of a finalizable object, that
   object shall be finalized before the component is automatically
   deallocated."
{Specify that automatic deallocation is part of object destruction and thus
 occurs after calling final subroutines.}

[141:6] Change "or assignment" to ", assignment, or finalization".
{Ensure purity of finalization within FORALL.}

[275:40] Ditto.
{Same for PURE procedures.}

[358:23+] Insert
  "(g) Finalizable variables that are not finalized and are accessed from a
       module that is not referenced either directly or indirectly by any other
       scoping unit that is making either a direct or indirect reference to the
       subprogram."

   Example of a parameterized derived type with final subroutines:

   MODULE m
     TYPE t(k)
       REAL(k),POINTER :: vector(:) => NULL()
     CONTAINS
       FINAL :: finalize_t1s, finalize_t1v, finalize_t2e

     END SUBROUTINE
     SUBROUTINE finalize_t1v(x)
       TYPE(t(KIND(0.0))) x(:)
       DO i=LBOUND(x,1),UBOUND(x,1)
         IF (ASSOCIATED(x(i)%vector)) DEALLOCATE(x(i)%vector)

     TYPE(t(KIND(0.0d0))) d(n,n)
     ...
     ! Returning from this subroutine will effectively do
     !    CALL finalize_t1s(a)
     !    CALL finalize_t1v(b)
     !    CALL finalize_t2e(d)
     ! No final subroutine will be called for variable C because the user
     ! omitted to define a suitable specific procedure for it.
   END SUBROUTINE

   Example of extended types with final subroutines:

   MODULE m
     TYPE,EXTENSIBLE :: t1
       REAL a,b
     END TYPE
     TYPE,EXTENDS(t1) :: t2
       REAL,POINTER :: c(:),d(:)

       FINAL :: t3f
     END TYPE
     ...
