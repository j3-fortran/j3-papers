----------

I think there are problems with the producer-consumer program on page
34 of N1983. The essence of the body of the inner do loop is
   CALL EVENT_QUERY(EVENT[I], COUNT)
   IF (I/= THIS_IMAGE) THEN
      IF (COUNT==0) THEN
         ! Produce some work for image I
         EVENT_POST(EVENT[I])
      END IF
   ELSE
      EVENT_WAIT(EVENT)
      ! Consume some work
   END IF
If the executing image produces some work for image I, where does it
put it? Presumably on image I, so that the consumer has ready access
to it. There is nothing to stop two images producing work for image I
at the same time - an obvious data race.

The most satisfactory solution that I have found so far is to limit
count values to 0 and 1 and make it an error to post to an event with
count 1. This allows the code to be changed to

   IF (I/= THIS_IMAGE()) THEN
      EVENT_POST(PRODUCE[I],STAT=STATUS)
      IF (STATUS==ALREADY_POSTED) CYCLE
      ! Produce some work for image i
      EVENT_POST(CONSUME[I])
   ELSE
      EVENT_WAIT(CONSUME)
      ! Consume some work
      EVENT_WAIT(PRODUCE)
   END IF

Now, if the executing image manages to post to PRODUCE[I], it knows
that only it is producing work for image I and it is safe to place
the work in the agreed coarrays on I. When the work has been produced,
it posts to CONSUME[I]. Image I waits for this post and then consumes
the work. The event PRODUCE remains posted while this is done, which
prevents other images overwriting the data with a new work item.

A further advantage of this is that the work is well balanced - we
cannot have a large number of work items waiting on one image while
others have none.

There are two further problems with the existing example. First, there
is no exit. Second, all images start by trying to post to image I.
These are fixed in the replacement below.

To keep the code simple, I have made the effect of finding an erroneous
stat value be a simple exit.

Bill Long has suggested an alternative change, which is to have an
optional specifier that returns the value .true. if the count is found
to be positive. In this case, the count would not be changed. This
effectively makes the event post usable as a binary event facility
without taking away the counting version that we have now.

Edits to N1983
--------------

Full edits will be supplied in a revision of this paper if one or other
of the two ideas is favoured. This is the changed example with the first
alternative.

[34:19-48] Replace example by

PROGRAM PROD_CONS
USE, INTRINSIC :: ISO_FORTRAN_ENV
INTEGER I, STATUS
TYPE(EVENT_TYPE) :: PRODUCE[*], CONSUME[*]
I = THIS_IMAGE()
DO
   I = I + 1
   IF (I>NUM_IMAGES()) I = 1
   IF (I/= THIS_IMAGE()) THEN
      EVENT_POST(PRODUCE[I],STAT=STATUS)
      IF (STATUS==ALREADY_POSTED) CYCLE
      IF (STATUS/=0) EXIT
      ! Produce some work for image i
      EVENT_POST(CONSUME[I],STAT=STATUS)
      IF (STATUS/=0) EXIT
   ELSE
      EVENT_WAIT(CONSUME,STAT=STATUS)
      IF (STATUS/=0) EXIT
      ! Consume the work
      EVENT_WAIT(PRODUCE,STAT=STATUS)
      IF (STATUS/=0) EXIT
   END IF
   ! If all work done, exit
END DO
! If work remaining, print message
END PROGRAM PROD_CONS
