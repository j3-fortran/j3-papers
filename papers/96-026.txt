From: Janice C. Shepherd
Subject: 96-006 status
Date:  January 19, 1996


As of Jan 19th, there are 205 defect items (plus item 000000).
The current version is 96-006.

Status          Quantity
------          --------

Published          128
WG5 approved        52
X3J3 approved        4
X3J3 consideration  14
subsumed             8

John Reid has developed a corrigendum 3 that includes the edits from
the 52 WG5 approved items (not all 52 have edits).

The outstanding tasks that need attention that I am aware of are:
  - nominate a new interpretation editor

  - continue to produce answers for interpretations

  - request Miles to hold a ballot on those items with the status
       "X3J3 approved; ready for WG5"

  - provide Miles with the text of the defect items that correspond
    with the corrigendum 3. These are all the "WG5 approved; ready for
    SC22" items (at least 52 items, perhaps more if you can get them
    through the balloting process prior to when Miles needs them).
    In the past I always extracted the items out of the 006 files for
    Jeanne.

  - determine when and how to switch over to interpreting Fortran 95,
    instead of Fortran 90. There had been a suggestion to make
    a new standing document based on the existing 006 files, including
    those items published with any of corrigendums 1, 2, or 3. This
    new standing document would be the Fortran 90 interpretation
    document. The new 006 files would start with those items that
    were not published with any of the corrigedums 1, 2 or 3.
    I would expect that the Fortran 90 interpretation document would
    continue to be examined as the information for the most part also
    applies to Fortran 95.


                                                                 X3J3/96-026
