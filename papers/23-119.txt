TITLE: Conflicting rules for COMMON block names
KEYWORDS: COMMON Block, Named Constant, USE association renaming

STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

A survey of five compilers finds that three disallow a named constant
from having the same name as a COMMON block in a give scope, while two
compilers permit named constants sharing the same name as a COMMON 
block accessible in the same scope. 
            
19.3.1 Classes of local identifiers, paragraph 1 establishes identifiers
of names constants to be class (1) identifiers.  Paragraph 2 states:

"Within a scope, a local identifier of an entity of class (1) or 
 class(4) shall not be the same as a global identifier used in that 
 scope unless the global identifier 
    o ...
    o is a common block name
    o ..."

However, 19.3.2 Local identifiers that are the same as common block 
names states:

"A name that identifies a common block in a scoping unit shall not be
 used to identify a constant or an intrinsic procedure in that 
 scoping unit. ..."

which disallows a named constant from having the same name as an 
accessible common block. 

14.2.2 The USE statement and use association contains Note 4 which
states

"The constraints in 8.10.1, 8.10.2, and 8.9 prohibit the local-name
 from appearing in a COMMON statement, and equivalence-object in an
 EQUIVALENCE statement, or a namelist-group-name in a NAMELIST state-
 ment, respectively.  There is no prohibition against the local-name
 appearing as a common-block-name or a namelist-group-object."

The last sentence of this note contradicts the restrictions in 19.3.2.

Q1. Is the intent to disallow a local identifier that identifies a 
    named constant from being the same as an accessible common block?

ANSWER:

A1. Yes, a the local identifier of a named constant cannot be the same
    as that of an accessible common block.  This issue goes back to 
    FORTRAN 77 when the PARAMETER statement was introduced. When 
    Fortran 90 introduced MODULEs and USE association, the restriction
    on common block names was overlooked when the note was written. 
    Clarifying edits are provided.

EDITS to N2209:
[302 Note 4] second sentence 
  delete
    "a common-block-name or"
  add at the end of the note 
    "Restrictions on local-name being the same as a common-block-name
     are detailed in 19.3.2."

[530:15] change the "," at the end of the bullet to:
  "and the local identifier is not that of a named constant or 
   intrinsic procedure,"
