Discussion

These seven issues together necessitate a rewrite of most of 8.4. We
therefore discuss them in a single paper. We have taken the
opportunity to include here the note moved from 2.3.4 (issue 4, paper
06-236) and to add a sentence on what happens on abnormal termination
of execution of an image.

Issue 26 (page 194)

We agree that discussion of the end-program statement belongs in
Clause 2 and have removed it from 8.4.


Issue 27 (page 194)

Executing a STOP statement results in normal termination of execution
of the image.  If a set of images synchronize immediately before each
executes a STOP statement, then normal termination of execution of
each of the images in the set occurs.  If there are other images
executing, they are terminated.  It is not viable to have only a
subset of the images executing.


Issue 28 (page 194)

We have restored the Fortran 2003 text "available in a processor-dependent 
manner".

Issue 29 (page 195)

The intention is that (abnormal) termination is rather like the user
entering cntl-C at the keyboard.

Issue 30 (page 195)

We have removed any mention of image 1. 

Issue 31 (page 195)

We hope this is resolved by making it clear which images terminate
normally and which terminate abnormally. 

Issue 32 (page 195)

Discussion of <end-program-stmt> has been removed from this section.


Edits to J3/06-007

[194:13 - 195:17] Replace the current text of 8.4 STOP between C840
and Note 8.27 with:

Execution of a STOP statement causes normal termination of execution
of that image.  If each image of a set of images executes a STOP
statement immediately following the execution of a construct that
performs a synchronization of the images in the set, normal
termination of execution occurs for all of the images in the set; the
executions of all other images are terminated.  If execution of an
image occurs for some other reason, termination of execution occurs on
all other images.

Note 8.26a 
Execution of a STOP statement immediately following execution of a
SYNC_ALL causes normal termination of execution on all images.

If only a subset of the images have their executions terminate
normally, how soon termination takes place on the other images is
processor dependent.
[end Note]

At the time of normal termination of an image, its <stop-code>, if
any, is made available in a processor-dependent manner.  If any
exception (14) is signaling on that image, the processor shall issue a
warning indicating which exceptions are signaling; this warning shall
be on the unit identified by the named constant ERROR_UNIT (13.8.3.6).
It is recommended that the <stop-code> is made available by formatted
output to the same unit.

Note 8.26b
When normal termination occurs on more than one image, it is expected
that some processor-dependent summary of the stop codes and signaling
exceptions will be made available.
[end Note]
