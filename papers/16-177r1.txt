Discussion:

In 10.10.3.1p9 of List-directed input forms, the description of
assigning a value to a character input item reads:

"Let <len> be the length of the next effective item, and let <w> be
the length of the character sequence. If <len> is less than or equal
to <w>, the leftmost <len> characters of the sequence are transmitted
to the next effective item. If <len> is greater than <w>, the sequence
is transmitted to the leftmost <w> characters of the next effective
item and the remaining <len-w> characters of the next effective item
are filled with blanks. The effect is as though the sequence were
assigned to the next effective item in an intrinsic assignment
statement (7.2.1.3)."

Except the last sentence, the description is of intrinsic assignment
to a nonallocatable character variable. But the last sentence omits
that limitation, and appears to also cover the case of the variable
being allocatable with a deferred len parameter.  I assume we do not
intend to require that character input/output list items are
reallocated during the list-directed input processing. This appears to
be a previously overlooked integration issue.

This issue was raised on the Fortran 90 email list by Anton
Shterenlikht.

The suggested repair is to modify the last sentence
to exclude the possibility of reallocating the effective list item.

Edits to J3/16-007r1:

[279:11] In 10.10.3.1p9 List-directed input forms, append to the end
of the last sentence of the paragraph " where the variable is a
nonallocatable character with the same <len> parameter as the
effective item".

This makes the whole sentence read:

"The effect is as though the sequence were assigned to the next
effective item in an intrinsic assignment statement (7.2.1.3) where
the variable is a nonallocatable character with the same <len>
parameter as the effective item."
