SUBJECT:  Minor editorial change to character intrinsic description

While reading interp 00003 I discovered a minor nit.  I think everything
in the response is clear and correct.  But, a similar change in 7.1.4.2
would also clarify things.  I don't believe this is important enough to
warrant an Interp request and response against F95.

The big paragraph in 7.1.4.2 (page 120 in 007R3, unfortunately I
don't have the updated 007) describes the type of intrinsic operations.
Almost all of the descriptions start with  "For an expression x1 op x2
where op is an ????? intrinsic operator..."  and the ????? is "real",
"logical", etc.  But the description for character is different.  The
second line in the paragraph is  "For an expression x1 // x2 where x1
and x2 are of type character...."  By leaving out the "// is an
intrinsic operator" a reader could think this applied to all
character concatenations and that you can't overload // to apply to
character arguments with different kinds.  That wasn't out intent.

EDIT:
The edit is simple.  On line 2 replace "where x1 and x2 are" by
"where // is the character intrinsic operator and x1 and x2 are"

This makes the sentence parallel to the others.  Character intrinsic
operator is defined near the end of 7.1.2.  But, the edits in interp
0003 haven't been applied yet to that section.
