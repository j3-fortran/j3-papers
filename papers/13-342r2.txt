Discussion - Responses with edits
---------------------------------

{Dan 4}: In [13:9] change "includes" to "references" to avoid
constraining the implementation.
Response: At [13:10-11] we say that the initial count value is
zero. Vaguely implying that count is a component with default
initialization. An edit is provided to avoid the implementation issue.

{Van 12}: At [13:15] "in a" -> "in an".
Response: Agreed. Edit included below.

{Dan 5}: Add a statement that the order of event posts is
processor-dependent.
Response: See {Bill I6}.

{Van 13}: At [13:24] Is the EVENT POST statement the only way to post
an event?  It would be neutral to say "Execution of an EVENT POST
statement posts an event."
Response: The current text needs improvement. This is covered by an
edit to [13:29].

{Bill I6}: At [13:29+] In the new Atomic subroutines section we say
that "How sequences of atomic actions in unordered segments interleave
with each other is processor dependent."  That text is copied from
F2008. Should we have a similar statement about event posts, since
they are similar to atomic operations?
Response: Yes.  Edits are provided.

{Nick 10a}: 6.3 p13:29.  The sentences referring to unsuccessful
[posts] should be removed, as there are no defined conditions that can
cause them to fail and still given them access to the event
variable.
Response: For consistency with the standard, we should be talking
about "error conditions" rather than "unsuccessful posts". We do not
spell out all possible error conditions, but an event post might
detect that it was trying to post to a failed image and an event wait
statement might detect that information sent from the posting image
had become corrupted, of the operation failed because of a network
timeout.  An edit is provided.

{Van 14}: At [13:31] Is the EVENT WAIT statement the only way to wait
for an event?  It would be neutral to say "Execution of an EVENT WAIT
statement waits until an event is posted."
Response: This is covered by the edit to [14:1-2].

{Van 15}: At [14:1-2] What is "success" for a wait?  Is it waiting, or
continuing without needing to wait, or what?
Response: An edit is provided to reword these sentences.  See also
{Nick 10b} with further edits this paragraph.

{Nick 10b}: 6.4 p14:2.  The sentences referring to unsuccessful waits
should be removed, as there are no defined conditions that can cause
them to fail and still given them access to the event variable.
Response: See response for {Nick 10a}. A similar edit is provided.

{Nick 11}: 6.4 p14:3-7.  At least two responses to N1967 pointed out
that the definition of sequencing makes no sense, on the grounds that
ordering between images is defined only by image control statements,
and the order of these image control statements depends on the
ordering between images!  This is not a simple matter, and simple
wording changes will not resolve it.  As I commented there, the
easiest solution to this is to change events from general semaphores
into binary ones, and define an error return from EVENT POST if the
event is already posted.  If this is not done, some mathematically
consistent definition of the ordering must be provided.  As this
appears to be beyond the state of the art in computer science, it may
be hard to achieve.
Response: An event variable exists on a single image and changes to it
are essentially atomic. An edit is provided.


Discussion - Responses only
---------------------------

{Reinhold B.1}: Introduce split barrier facility. This is the topic of
paper 13-301.

{Nick 9}: 6.2 p13:15-18.  To avoid the array copying problem, this
also needs to exclude explicit-shape and assumed-size arrays
containing event variables.
Response: Copying cannot happen because an event variable is required
to be a coarray.


{Dan 9}: Clarify that the order of arrival of the effects of event
posts and event waits is processor dependent.
Response: For event posts, see {Dan 5}. For event waits, there is no
"order of arrival" issue since event waits are always local and the
count increments are not tagged.



Edits to N1983
--------------

[13:7-8] {Ed} Change "All components have default initialization" to
"Each component is fully default initialized".  {Similar to edit in
13-335r3 for TEAM_TYPE.}

[13:9] {Dan 4} Change "includes" to "has".

[13:15] {Van 12} Change last "in a" to "in an".

[13:29] {Van 13} Change "A successful post to an event variable
        increments its count." to "Successful execution of an EVENT
        POST statement increments the event variable's count.".

[13:29] {Nick 10a} Change "An unsuccessful post does not change the
count." to "If an error condition occurs during the execution of an
EVENT POST statement, the count does not change."

[13:29+] {Bill I6} Add paragraph: "How sequences of posts in unordered
segments interleave with each other is processor dependent."

[14:1-2] {Van 14, Nick 10b} replace entire para with
    "Execution of an EVENT WAIT statement causes the executing image to
     wait until the count of the event variable is positive or an error
     condition occurs.  If no error condition occurs, the count of the
     event variable is decreased by 1.".

[14:3] {Van m30} Change "During the execution" to "During execution".

[14:4] {Nick 11} Before "If the count" add sentence: "The effect of
each change is as if it occurred instantaneously, without any overlap
with another change.".

[14:4-5] {Van m31} Change "through" to "because of" twice.

[31:29] {Bill I6} At the end of 8.9, adjust the end-of-line
punctuation and add a new processor dependency: " how sequences of
posts in unordered segments interleave with each other."
