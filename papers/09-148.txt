NUMBER: F03/0063
TITLE: Procedure pointers in BLOCK DATA program units
KEYWORDS: Procedure pointer, common block, block data
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: J3 consideration in progress

QUESTION:

It is clear that procedure pointers are permitted in common blocks.
However, due to the restrictions on BLOCK DATA program units, it seems
that such a common block can not appear in a BLOCK DATA program unit.

Was it intended that common blocks containing procedure pointers could
be initialized in a BLOCK DATA program unit?

ANSWER 1:

It was a mistake to try to allow procedure pointers in common blocks.

Edits are provided to correct this blunder.

ANSWER 2:

Yes, it was intended that common blocks containing procedure pointers
could be initialized in a BLOCK DATA program unit.  Edits are provided
to correct this oversight.

EDITS 1:

All edits refer to 04-007.

[98:17] Delete the second line of R558.

[98:21] After "allocatable" insert "or a procedure pointer".

EDITS 2:

All edits refer to 04-007.

[98:21-22 5.5.2 C588]
  Delete "a function name, an entry name," because these were originally
  synonyms for "a result name" (as applied to <variable-name> in R558). 
  Now, "a function name" (as applied to <proc-pointer-name> in R558)
  prohibits function pointers.

[253:12 11.3 C1117]
  After "derived-type definitions", insert ", abstract interface
          blocks,".

[253:14 11.3 C1117]
  Before "and type declaration", insert "procedure declaration,".

[254:3 11.3 C1118]  Delete ", EXTERNAL,"

[254:3+ 11.3 C1118+] Insert a new constraint:

C1118a (R1116) An entity in a BLOCK DATA program unit that has the
       EXTERNAL attribute shall also have the POINTER attribute.

[416:24 16.4.3.1] After "each combination of" insert  "procedureness,"
