1. Discussion

Module variables or host-associated variables that are defined in
functions or procedures invoked from them become undefined if a
reference to the function appears in a context where the processor
doesn't have to execute it.

The allocation status of similar variables might be considered to be
undefined, but the allocation status can't become undefined; it's only
indeterminate, which means its processor dependent.

The status of a similar lock variable might be considered to be
undefined, but the intent is that it can't become undefined; it's only
indeterminate, which means its processor dependent.

2. Edits

[131:22+ 6.7.1.3p5+]----------------------------------------------------
Editor: Add a new paragraph:

"If the evaluation of a function would cause a variable to become
allocated and if a reference to the function appears in an expression in
which the value of the function is not needed to determine the value of
the expression, the allocation status of the variable after evaluation
of the expression is processor dependent."

[133:24+ 6.7.3.2p13+]---------------------------------------------------
Editor: Add a new paragraph:

"If the evaluation of a function would cause a variable to become
deallocated and if a reference to the function appears in an expression
in which the value of the function is not needed to determine the value
of the expression, the allocation status of the variable after
evaluation of the expression is processor dependent."

[195:4+ 8.5.6p4+]-------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Add a new paragraph:

"If the evaluation of a function would cause a lock variable to become
locked or unlocked and if a reference to the function appears in an
expression in which the value of the function is not needed to determine
the value of the expression, whether the variable is locked or unlocked
after evaluation of the expression is processor dependent."

[463:37+ 5.3.7+]--------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Insert a new item:

"o If the evaluation of a function would cause a variable to become
   allocated and if a reference to the function appears in an expression
   in which the value of the function is not needed to determine the
   value of the expression, the allocation status of the variable after
   evaluation of the expression is processor dependent (6.7.1.3).

[463:38+ 6.7.3]---------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Replace "6.7.3" by "6.7.3.2" (the last paragraph of 6.7.3.2
describes this situation).

[463:40+ 6.7.3.2+]------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Insert a new item:

"o If the evaluation of a function would cause a variable to become
   deallocated and if a reference to the function appears in an
   expression in which the value of the function is not needed to
   determine the value of the expression, the allocation status of the
   variable after evaluation of the expression is processor dependent
   (6.7.3.2)."

[464:21+ 8.5.5+]--------------------------------------------------------
Editor: Insert a new item:

"o If the evaluation of a function would cause a lock variable to become
   locked or unlocked and if a reference to the function appears in an
   expression in which the value of the function is not needed to
   determine the value of the expression, whether the variable is locked
   or unlocked after evaluation of the expression is processor dependent
   (8.5.6)."
