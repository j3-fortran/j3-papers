Subject: The draft standard can still be improved.

Subgroup recommends that these changes be considered.

1. Miscellaneous

(a) Note 4.9 seems out of date and inappropriate now that we have the IEEE
modules.  When it says "this standard" it really means "this standard and the
preceding one".
	[38:Note 4.9] Delete.

(b) Apparently "CHARACTER*" syntax is "an unnecessary redundancy".  As
opposed to all the redundant features that are necessary I suppose.  Please
fix this tautology.  Also, use of the past tense is incorrect.
	[441:22] "was an unnecessary redundancy" -> "is redundant".

(c) C.10.1 item 5 claims that certain intrinsic functions like GET_COMMAND
"function correctly, even if the main program is defined by means other than
Fortran".  This appears to be unsupported by any normative text, and very
difficult if not impossible to implement on many systems to boot.  It also
refers to these as "command line environment intrinsic routines", which is
not their title (they are "system environment procedures" in Ch13).  The
only procedure listed in C.10.1 item 5 which could reasonably be expected to
work in all circumstances is GET_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE.  As a result, 
the sentence has no meaning and should be removed.

Delete  [486:28-30] 

(d) The last sentence of C.11.1 uses the wrong tense with "shall", making the
sentence somewhat confusing (it is referring to an invalid example - which
did not satisfy the requirement - making the imperative form inappropriate).
It should use the passive form.

      [493:2] "shall" -> "is required to".

2. Subclause 5.1.2.5 is self-contradictory and hard to understand

The problems here are that:
	(1) Sentences 2 and 3 describe what is intended to be the same effect
(overriding a DIMENSION attr-spec with an array-spec in the entity-decl), but
use different words and are not consistent: sentence 2 says that the
array-spec defines the "rank or shape" whereas sentence 3 says that it
defines the "rank or rank and shape".
	(2) Sentence 4 is a lie; it claims that one can only declare an array
in a type declaration statement if you have a DIMENSION attr-spec or an
array-spec.  This is false because you can declare the array spec elsewhere
but still declare other attributes of the entity in a type declaration stmt.
	(3) Sentence 1 is poorly phrased.  It says that the DIMENSION attr
specifies "entities that are arrays" whereas it actually specifies that
entities *are* arrays.  Not a big deal, but we might as well say it right.
(We do it right, or at least better, in 5.1.2.1, 5.1.2.3, et al.)

[78:3] "entities that are arrays" -> "that an entity is an array".
{Say what we mean.}
[78:3] "rank or shape" -> "rank or rank and shape".
{Either we need to say it like this always, or just "rank or shape" will do
everywhere.  I think maybe we ought to say it like this always.}
[78:5-6] Delete "An ... <attr-spec>."
{This sentence is completely redundant except where it disagreed with
sentence 2!}
[78:6] Change "declare an array" to "specify that an entity is an array".
