Discussion:
-----------

In the 16.9.194 SPLIT intrinsic function, the descriptions of the
arguments TOKENS, SEPARATOR, FIRST, and LAST include that the dummy
arguments are INTENT(OUT) and allocatable.  This implies that they are
allocated during execution of the SPLIT procedure.  In 15.5.2.6
Allocatable dummy variables, paragraph 4 we have "If the actual
argument is a coindexed object, the dummy argument shall have the
INTENT (IN) attribute." which effectively prohibits coindexed actual
arguments.  If the actual argument is a coarray, the internal ALLOCATE
in SPLIT effectively turns the SPLIT into a collective routine. It is
likely that neither of the se complications was intended.  The original
model of SPLIT was from a part of the standard that predated
coarrays. It is likely that the specification of these arguments to
SPLIT simply overlooked the possibility of coarray actual arguments,
and it would be better to just prohibit coarray and coindexed actual
arguments corresponding to TOKENS, SEPARATOR, FIRST and LAST.  This
limitation is unlikely to limit the expected use of the
routines. Edits are provided to make this prohibition explicit.
