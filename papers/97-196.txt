Subject: Proposed Draft Syntax for Single Inheritance/Type Extension

1. Introduction
---------------

This paper proposes syntax for single inheritance, the specifications of which
appear in 97-183r2.  Some clarifications of unclear points in 97-183r2 are
also provided.

2. Declaration syntax
---------------------

For base types the EXTENSIBLE keyword is used, as per 97-183r2.
For extended types the EXTENDS clause is used, different from 97-183r2.

We say a type has the EXTENSIBLE property if either of these clauses is used.
A type declared with the EXTENDS clause is an <<extended type>>.
The <<parent type>> of an extended type is the type named in the EXTENDS
clause.
The <<base type>> of a type declared with the EXTENSIBLE keyword is the
type itself; the <<base type>> of an extended type is the base type of its
parent type.

The F95 rule:

  R423 <derived-type-stmt> <<is>> TYPE [[,<access-spec]::] <type-name>

Becomes

  R423 <derived-type-stmt> <<is>> TYPE [[,<type-modifier-list>]::] <type-name>
  R423a <type-modifier> <<is>> EXTENSIBLE
                        <<or>> EXTENDS(<extensible-type-name>)
                        <<or>> <access-spec>

  Constraint: If the EXTENSIBLE type modifier is used, the EXTENDS clause
              shall not be present.

  R423b <extensible-type-name> <<is>> <type-name>

  Constraint: <parent-type-name> shall be the name of an accessible type
              that has the EXTENSIBLE property.

An additional constraint to the list following R424 is

  Constraint: If <type-name> has the EXTENSIBLE property, SEQUENCE shall not
              be present.

Examples

  TYPE,EXTENSIBLE :: point_2d
    REAL x,y
  END TYPE
  TYPE,EXTENDS(point_2d) :: point_3d
    REAL z
  END TYPE

2alt. Alternative Declaration Syntax
------------------------------------
The same as above, but with "BASE" replacing "EXTENSIBLE", and "INHERIT"
replacing "EXTENDS".  Thus the example become

  TYPE,BASE :: point_2d
    REAL x,y
  END TYPE
  TYPE,INHERIT(point_2d) :: point_3d
    REAL z
  END TYPE

3. Component References
-----------------------

The scope of an extended type includes all component names from the parent
type, together with its additional component names (if any), and the parent
component name; this latter has the same name as the parent type.

For intrinsic i/o purposes, the list of components is considered to be the same
as the parent type's list of components, with the extended components appended
to the end of the list.

Examples:

  TYPE(point_2d) p2
  TYPE(point_3d) p3

  p2 contains components: p2%x, p2%y
  p3 contains components: p3%x, p3%y, p3%z, p3%point_2d

  PRINT *,p2    ! Prints p2%x then p2%y
  PRINT *,p3    ! Prints p3%x then p3%y then p3%z

4. Polymorphic Variables
------------------------

Add a new <type-spec> possibility (to R502):

                       <<or>> OBJECT(<extensible-type-name>)

Add a new constraint to the type declaration constraint list (after R506):

  Constraint: An entity declared with the OBJECT keyword shall be a dummy
              argument or shall have the POINTER attribute.

Add a new constraint following for component definitions (after R427):

  Constraint: A component declared with the OBJECT keyword shall have the
              POINTER attribute.

"5.1.1.8 Polymorphic objects

 An OBJECT type specifier is used to declare entities that can, at run-time,
 assume the type of the derived type specified by the <type-name> or any
 other type that has been extended from that <type-name>.  A non-pointer
 polymorphic dummy argument assumes the type from the associated actual
 argument.  A polymorphic pointer dummy argument assumes the type of the
 associated actual pointer argument if the pointer actual argument has the
 pointer association status of "associated" at procedure invocation.  A
 polymorphic pointer assumes the type from its target in a pointer assignment
 statement, or assumes TYPE(<type-name>) from a successful ALLOCATE statement.
 A polymorphic pointer with a pointer association status of disassociated or
 undefined has no current type.

 A polymorphic name only provides direct access to the components of the
 declared type."

5. Argument Association
-----------------------

There are three cases:
 (1) Only the dummy argument is polymorphic
     - the actual argument must be of the declared type of the dummy argument,
       or of a type extended therefrom;
 (2) Only the actual argument is polymorphic
     - the actual argument's runtime type must be the same as the (fixed) type
       of the dummy argument or of a type extended therefrom;
 (3) Both the actual argument and the dummy argument are polymorphic
     - the actual argument's runtime type must be of the declared type of the
       dummy argument or of a type extended therefrom.

In cases (2) and (3) a runtime check may be necessary to enforce the rule.
Case (1) can always be checked at compile-time.

Examples:
 Given
   TYPE(point_2d) t2
   TYPE(point_3d) t3
   OBJECT(point_2d) p2
   OBJECT(point_3d) p3
   ! p2 and p3 are dummy arguments or pointers
 for case (1), given
   SUBROUTINE SUB2(x2); OBJECT(point_2d) x2
   SUBROUTINE SUB3(x3); OBJECT(point_3d) x2
 then
   CALL SUB2(t2) ! is legal - t2 is of the declared type of x2
   CALL SUB2(t3) ! is legal - t3 is extended from the declared type of x2
   CALL SUB3(t2) ! is illegal - t2 is not of a compatible type with x3
   CALL SUB3(t3) ! is legal - t3 is of the declared type of x3
 for case(2), given
   SUBROUTINE TUB2(d2); TYPE(point_2d) d2
   SUBROUTINE TUB3(d3); TYPE(point_3d) d3
 then
   CALL TUB2(p2) ! is legal - p2's declared type is the same as that of d2
   CALL TUB2(p3) ! is legal - p3's declared type extends that of d2
   CALL TUB3(p2) ! is only legal if p2's runtime type is TYPE(point_3d) or
                 ! something extended therefrom
   CALL TUB3(p3) ! is legal - p3's declared type matches that of d3
 for case(3),
   CALL SUB2(p2) ! is legal
   CALL SUB2(p3) ! is legal
   CALL SUB3(p2) ! is only legal if p2's runtime type is compatible
   CALL SUB3(p3) ! is legal

6. Pointer Assignment
---------------------
I propose that pointer assignment of polymorphic variables follow exactly the
same rules as argument association of non-pointers.

In particular, this allows
  TYPE,EXTENDS(point_3d) :: point_4d
    REAL t
  END TYPE
  ...
  TYPE(point_3d),POINTER :: p
  OBJECT(point_2d),TARGET :: dummy ! a dummy argument
  p => dummy ! Legal if dummy's runtime type is point_3d or anything extended
             ! therefrom, e.g. point_4d.  However, p only ever gives access to
             ! the point_3d part of a point_4d object.

7. Type Enquiry
---------------
Two new intrinsic functions SAME_TYPE_AS, CONTAINS_TYPE_OF.
(Same as in 97-183r2, with a name change for the second intrinsic).

SAME_TYPE_AS(POLY,MOLD)
  POLY is a polymorphic variable of any type.
  MOLD may be polymorphic or of fixed type.
  Result is .TRUE. if and only if POLY's runtime type is the same as that
  of MOLD.

CONTAINS_TYPE_OF(POLY,MOLD)
  POLY is a polymorphic variable of any type.
  MOLD may be polymorphic or of fixed type.
  Result is .TRUE. if and only if POLY's runtime type is the same as the type
  of MOLD or is an extension of the type of MOLD.

7alt: Alternative Type Enquiry
------------------------------
Instead of intrinsic functions these could be operators, viz
  .EQTYPE. for SAME_TYPE_AS
and
  .SUBTYPE. for CONTAINS_TYPE_OF

8. Access to Extended Components
--------------------------------
97-183r2 only provides one mechanism to access components of a type extended
from the variable, that is via additional names.

Example:
  OBJECT(point_2d) p2 ! dummy argument

  If p2 is known to be of runtime TYPE(point_3d), to gain access to the
  Z component an additional variable is needed, e.g.

  TARGET p2
  TYPE(point_3d),POINTER :: p3
  IF (CONTAINS_TYPE_OF(p2,MOLD=p3)) THEN
    p3 => p2
    PRINT *,'Z component is',p3%z
  ELSE
    PRINT *,'ERROR: p2 only has 2 dimensions'
  END IF

8alt: Alternative mechanism for accessing extended components
-------------------------------------------------------------
The above mechanism is not too complicated for a very small number of
types but requires additional pointers to be declared and it can become
tedious doing all the type tests.

I therefore propose a SELECT TYPE construct, with each <type-selection-block>
acting as a scoping unit in which the components of the selected type
are directly visible (as if the TYPE were a MODULE which it USEd).

The example above then becomes:

  OBJECT(point_2d) p2 ! dummy argument
  SELECT TYPE(p2)
    TYPE IN (point_3d)
      PRINT *,'Z component is',z
    ELSE
      PRINT *,'ERROR: p2 only has 2 dimensions'
  END SELECT

There are two forms of type selector, "TYPE IN" which implicitly invokes the
CONTAINS_TYPE_OF intrinsic, and "TYPE IS" which implicitly invokes the
SAME_TYPE_AS intrinsic.  Thus the ELSE clause could have been written
    TYPE IS (point_2d)

The syntax for this is as follows:

Rxxx1 <select-type-construct> <<is>> <select-type-stmt>
                                     <type-selection-block>...
                                     [ <else-selection-block> ]
                                     <end-select-type-stmt>

Rxxx2 <select-type-stmt> <<is>> SELECT TYPE ( <expr> )

Constraint: <expr> shall be a polymorphic object or a reference to a function
            that returns a polymorphic pointer.

Rxxx3 <type-selection-block> <<is>> <type-selection-stmt> <block>

Rxxx4 <type-selection-stmt> <<is>> TYPE IS ( <extensible-type-name> )
                            <<or>> TYPE IN ( <extensible-type-name> )

Rxxx5 <else-selection-block> <<is>> <else-selection-stmt> <block>

Rxxx6 <else-selection-stmt> <<is>> ELSE

Rxxx7 <end-select-type-stmt> <<is>> END SELECT

Each type selection condition is tested in turn, and the block executed for
the first one that is satisfied; control then passes to the end-select-type
statement.  [This allows easier programming of complicated type selections,
without preventing use of a jump table should the type tag values be
suitable for such usage.  Though perhaps we should choose a different keyword
to avoid the false similarity with the SELECT CASE construct?]

- - - - - -

Another common complaint (even with normal derived types) is that accessing
several components that lie at the end of several data-ref's is tedious
(i.e. the complaint is that Fortran does not have any equivalent of Pascal's
WITH statement).

We could kill two birds with one stone here with a slight change of keywords
and extension of the above (SELECT TYPE) proposal; 

Example of keyword change:
  INSPECT(p2)
    WHEN TYPE IN(point_3d)
      PRINT *,'Z component is',z
    ELSE
      PRINT *,'ERROR: p2 only has 2 dimensions'
  END INSPECT

Example of user complaint:
  LONG_VARIABLE_NAME%ARRAY_COMPONENT(I+1,J,K*N+3)%SCALAR%I_VALUE = 1
  LONG_VARIABLE_NAME%ARRAY_COMPONENT(I+1,J,K*N+3)%SCALAR%J_VALUE =
      LONG_VARIABLE_NAME%ARRAY_COMPONENT(I+1,J,K*N+3)%SCALAR%J_VALUE + 1
  LONG_VARIABLE_NAME%ARRAY_COMPONENT(I+1,J,K*N+3)%SCALAR%K_VALUE = 0
Example of solution:
  INSPECT(LONG_VARIABLE_NAME%ARRAY_COMPONENT(I+1,J,K*N+3)%SCALAR)
    I_VALUE = 1
    J_VALUE = J_VALUE + 1
    K_VALUE = 0
  END INSPECT

9. Generic Resolution
---------------------
The rules for unambiguous generic procedure names require that there be both
a disambiguating argument "by position" and "by name" - with some positional
requirements if these are not the same argument.

A polymorphic dummy argument in a procedure can act as a disambiguator if the
corresponding dummy argument in the other procedure is either of a type that
is not extensible (i.e. an intrinsic type or a non-extensible derived type)
or if it is of an extensible type that has a different base type to that of
the polymorphic dummy argument.

(This is the same as in 97-183r2, the wording has been changed to try to make
things clearer.)
