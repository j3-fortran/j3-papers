OpenACC Liaison Report
======================
Information about OpenACC, including the current standard document,
training materials, and upcoming events can be found at
http://www.openacc.org/.

The current OpenACC standard is version 3.2. Version 3.2 of the OpenACC
specification was adopted November 2021.  The specification can be found
at https://www.openacc.org/specification. 

News
----
Progress continues on upstreaming support for OpenACC into the
LLVM Compiler Infrastructure Project through the CLACC and FLACC
projects. More information on this compiler is available at the OpenACC
website, https://www.openacc.org/.

Hewlett Packard Enterprise further discussed their renewed support
for OpenACC in their Fortran compiler at Supercomputing 2021. This 
support is targeted for public release in mid-2022.

Applications
------------
There are over 250 applications in production or development using
OpenACC, including:
 - Code LEO (Computational Fluid Dynamics)
 - NekCEM (Computational Electromagnetics)
 - INCOMP3d (3D incompressible Navier-Stokes solver)
 - Cloverleaf
 - MAESTRO and CASTRO (modeling stellar  explosions)
 - LSDalton (quantum chemistry)
 - SPECFEM-X (Geophysics)
 -  GTS (Fusion)
 And the usual suspects:
 - Gaussian 16
 - ANSYS Fluent
 - VASP 6
 - MPAS-A
 - COSMO
 - GAMERA for GPU
 - Quantum Espresso

More information on these can be found on the OpenACC
web site at https://www.openacc.org/success-stories.

Hackathons 
----------
OpenACC continues to host numerous hackathons each year. OpenACC is 
generally the preferred approach for Fortran applications attending 
the events. Event dates are posted at 
https://www.gpuhackathons.org/events. It is not a requirement to use
OpenACC directives to participate in these hackathons.

Community Engagement
--------------------
OpenACC held a Birds of a Feather session at the Supercomputing 
conference in November 2021, which was well attended both in-
person and virtually. One speaker at the event noted his 
organization's successful use of DO CONCURRENT as a replacement
for many of the existing OpenACC directives, requiring directives
only for atomics and data movement after converting loops.

The organization also has a BOF planned for the Cray Users Group 
meeting in May 2022 and has submitted to other events.
