Subject: ASYNCHRONOUS and VOLATILE are poorly described


1. Introduction

The form of words used in the definitions of the ASYNCHRONOUS (5.1.2.3) and
VOLATILE (5.1.2.16) attributes leave much to be desired.  The current wording
in both cases omits to say what the attribute actually means; instead, they
require the attribute to be specified if certain conditions apply.

For example (Page 75, line 5) states:
  "The base object of a variable shall have the <<ASYNCHRONOUS attribute>> in
   a scoping unit if:"
followed by a specification of the situation in which this attribute is
required.

and (Page 83,line 4) states
   "An object shall have the VOLATILE attribute if..."

This form of words is unlike that used for other attributes.

Furthermore, there appears to be a technical flaw in the existing definition
of VOLATILE.

2. VOLATILE problem

[83:4-5] Says that VOLATILE is required for an object "if there is a reference
to or definition" of it "by means not specified in this standard".

This would, for example, mean that all BIND(C) globals require VOLATILE if they
are ever referenced or defined from C.  E.g.

test.f90
   MODULE m
     REAL,BIND(C,NAME="xyz") :: xyz
   END
   PROGRAM test
     USE m
     INTERFACE
       SUBROUTINE csub, BIND(C)
       END
     END SUBROUTINE
     xyz = 3
     CALL csub
     PRINT *,xyz
   END

csub.c
   extern float xyz;
   void csub(void)
   {
     xyz = xyz*xyz - 1;
   }

Clearly, the references and definitions in the file csub.c are by means not
specified in this (Fortran) standard.  We don't think this is a situation
where VOLATILE is supposed to be used.

3. Edits to 02-007r3

[75:5-] Insert new paragraph
  "The <<ASYNCHRONOUS attribute>> specifies that a variable may be subject
   to asynchronous input/output."

[75:5] Unembolden "ASYNCHRONOUS attribute".

[83:4-5] Replace with
  "The <<VOLATILE attribute>> specifies that an object may be referenced,
   defined, or become undefined, by means not specified by the program."

[83:10+2-3] Replace "If ... target," with
  "If the target of a pointer is referenced, defined, or becomes undefined,
   by means not specified by the program, while the pointer is associated 
   with the target,"


[83:9-10] Replace with
  "A pointer with the VOLATILE attribute may additionally have its association
   status and array bounds (if any) changed by means not specified by the 
   program."

[83:11-12] Replace with
  "An allocatable object with the VOLATILE attribute may additionally have its
   allocation status, dynamic type and type parameters, and array bounds (if 
   any) changed by means not specified by the program."

Note that the first of these two edits makes volatility (of a pointer) apply
to the target as well as to the association status.
