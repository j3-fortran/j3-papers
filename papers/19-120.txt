Introduction
============

William Clodius has recently pointed out that containers need iterators.
Others have pointed this out earlier.

This paper is essentially a reproduction of 18-245, which is marked
"superceded" without further explanation in the meeting 217 paper list. 
Meeting 217 minutes remark it was announced as "background" on Thursday
18 October PM without further explanation or discussion.

The pdf accompanying 18-245, numbered 18-245r1.pdf, was removed from the
server on Monday 15 October.

This paper has an accompanying PDF, probably 19-121.  This paper is a
summary.  Read the pdf, which is a complete proposal, cast in the form
of a TS, but without edits.

Use Cases
=========

If one needs to traverse a tree, or a graph, or a particular row or
column of a sparse matrix, or ... one ought not need to know the
representation of the container object.  It should be possible to
iterate over the contents of a container, or an easily-identified subset
of its contents (such as one row of a sparse matrix, or all the "purple"
vertices of a graph), using an abstraction that has a form independent
of a container's representation.

Proposal
========

To provide an iterator abstraction, a new control construct ought to be
provided that uses a new (to Fortran) variety of a procedure, commonly
called an iterator.  In the simplest cases, syntax might be

  ITERATE ( [ <type-spec> :: ] <iteration-variable> = &
      <iterator-reference> )
    <block>
  END ITERATE

or

  ITERATE ( [ <type-spec> :: ] <data-pointer-object> => &
      <iterator-reference> )
    <block>
  END ITERATE

wherein <iteration-variable> or <data-pointer-object> is a construct
entity that is NOT restricted to be a scalar integer.  The iterator
result is assigned to the <iteration-variable> as if by intrinsic
assignment, or pointer assigned to <data-pointer-object> as if by
pointer assignment.  The <iterator-reference> has the same syntax as a
function reference.

The semantics are that the ITERATE statement initiates the iterator,
which either provides the first element of the container (or a pointer
associated with it) if there is one, or the iterator terminates.

If the iterator does not terminate, the block is executed, and then the
iterator is resumed.  If the iterator terminates, the <block> of the
ITERATE construct is not executed and the ITERATE construct completes
execution.

It should be possible to change the container during execution of the
ITERATE construct.  An example of the utility of this is a queue,
wherein the iterator deques the head of the queue, while actions in the
block might enque entities.  Whether this "makes sense" in a particular
case is the responsibility of the container and its iterators, not the
processor or the standard.

Coroutines have the same but less structured use.  They have essentially
the same internal structure as an iterator, the only differences being

  (1) a coroutine does not have a result value:  The relationship of
      coroutines to iterators is the same as the relationship of
      subroutines to functions, and
  (2) the invoking scope has a "handle" on the activation record of a
      coroutine if it is invoked using a procedure pointer, or as a
      type-bound procedure, while the activation record for an iterator
      is "owned" by the ITERATE construct.

Both coroutines and iterators should be provided.

The PDF corresponding to this text file is the twelfth draft of a TS
proposal I began developing in June 2010, after coroutines were dropped
from the work plan in 2007.  It contains detailed specifications of
coroutines, iterators, the ITERATE construct, and supporting statements
and intrinsic functions.  Further use cases are described therein (in
the introduction and as examples at the end), and in the referenced
papers.

Example Use Case
================

Here's a little bit of code that runs through a row of a sparse matrix
and does stuff using the elements.  Elements in each row are linked in a
circular list, with %rows indexing the last one (and elements of columns
are in circular lists too).

          k = eta%rows(ht_i)                ! Last element in row ht_i
          if ( k /= 0 ) then                ! Row isn't empty
            do
              j = eta%e(k)%c                ! eta's column subscript
              dhdt_1_tan(:,j)    = dhdt_tan(ht_i,:,j)    * eta%e(k)%v
              d2hdhdt_1_tan(:,j) = d2hdhdt_tan(ht_i,:,j) * eta%e(k)%v
              k = eta%e(k)%nr               ! Next element in the row
              if ( k == eta%rows(ht_i) ) exit ! back to the last one?
            end do
          end if

Here's how it would be with an iterator that returns a pointer of the
type of eta%e:

         iterate ( e => eta%row_iterate ( ht_i ) )
           dhdt_1_tan(:,e%c)    = dhdt_tan(ht_i,:,e%c)    * e%v
           d2hdhdt_1_tan(:,e%c) = d2hdhdt_tan(ht_i,:,e%c) * e%v
         end iterate

The version with the ITERATE construct doesn't need to know how eta is
represented.

Here's an example of how the iterator might be written

         iterator Row_Iterate ( Eta, Row ) result ( E )
             ! Reinhold's "persistent" attribute would be helpful here.
             ! Equally helpful would be if the E component of Eta could
             ! have the TARGET attribute:
           class (sparse_t), intent(in), target :: Eta
           integer, intent(in) :: Row
           type (sparse_element_t), pointer :: E
           integer :: K
           k = eta%rows(row)                  ! Last element in the row
           if ( k == 0 ) return               ! Row is empty
           do
             e => eta%e(k)
             suspend
             ! Come back here when the ITERATE construct resumes
             k = eta%e(k)%nr                  ! Next element in the row
             if ( k == eta%rows(row) ) return ! back to the last one?
           end do
         end iterator Row_Iterate

When the iterator executes a SUSPEND statement, the ITERATE construct
executes its body.  When the iterator executes a RETURN (or END)
statement, the ITERATE construct completes.  When the ITERATE statement
resumes the iterator (because the iterator didn't complete), execution
of the iterator resumes after the SUSPEND statement that most recently
suspended execution of the iterator (an iterator might have several
SUSPEND statements).

In case you want to dig this deep, here are the type definitions
(without their type-bound procedure bindings):

  type :: Sparse_Element_t ! One element in a sparse matrix
    real(rp) :: V  ! Element's value
    integer :: R   ! In which row is the element
    integer :: C   ! In which col is the element
    integer :: NR  ! Next element in same row
    integer :: NC  ! Next element in same col
  end type Sparse_Element_t

  type :: Sparse_t ! Representation for a sparse matrix
    ! Rows and columns are circular lists; last element indexes first
    integer, allocatable :: Rows(:) ! Last element in each row
    integer, allocatable :: Cols(:) ! Last element in each col
    type(sparse_element_t), allocatable :: E(:) ! nonzero elements
  end type :: Sparse_t
