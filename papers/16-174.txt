Discussion:
~~~~~~~~~~~

Section 12.5.2.8 discusses the properties of coarray dummy arguments.
These appear to be insufficiently specified; in particular, the NOTEs
12.32 and 12.33 in 16-007 refer to semantics that are not stated in
normative text. Furthermore, coindexed accesses to dummy arguments
appear to be prohibited in general, due to the anti-aliasing rules
in 12.5.2.13.

As an illustration of the issues (not meant to be a recommended
programming practice), consider the following procedures:


SUBROUTINE S1(A, IL)
  INTEGER :: A[*]
  INTEGER :: IL
  SYNC IMAGES ( [1,2]] )
  IL = A                    ! (A)
END SUBROUTINE

SUBROUTINE S2(A, IL)
  INTEGER :: A
  INTEGER :: IL
  SYNC IMAGES ( [1,2] )
  IL = A
END SUBROUTINE

and the following execution sequence on 2 images:

Image 1:

INTEGER  ::  I[*] = 0

I[2] = I[2] + 1
SYNC IMAGES( [1,2] )

Image 2:

INTEGER :: IL

CALL S1(I, IL)

The current text in the standard causes the above to be non-conforming
for two reasons:

(1) the dummy argument A of procedure S1 is modified by a different
    image, in violation of 12.5.2.13 para 3+4. Since the ability to do
    such modifications is part of the coarray design, further
    exceptions need to be added to the above paragraphs. The exceptions
    apply for coarray dummy arguments only, so replacing the call to
    S1 above by a call to S2 remains non-conforming even with the
    suggested relaxation of the anti-aliasing rules (moving the image
    control statement outside S2 to come before the invocation of S2
    resolves this).
(2) no interpretation is established in normative text on which coarray
    statement (A) performs its action; the same applies for coindexed
    definitions and references from inside the procedure on its dummy
    argument, or for actions by other images that access the coarray
    on the executing image. 12.5.2.8 para 2 and the non-normative
    examples following this paragraph strongly hint that it must be
    the ultimate argument, so this is spelled out explicitly.



Edits to 16-007:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[307:] after para 2, add new paragraph
"The coarray identified by a coarray dummy argument is its ultimate
 argument; its corank and cobounds are those specified in the dummy
 argument's <i>coarray-spec</i> (5.5.6.1). The procedure's executing
 image accesses the identified coarray by noncoindexed references
 or definitions of the dummy argument, or coindexed references or
 definitions of the dummy argument on any other image of the current
 team. Coindexed access to the identified coarray on the executing
 image by any other image on which it is established causes the
 dummy argument to be referenced or defined."

{complete the description of the argument associated coarray. The
term "identified by" is also used in TS 18508 [10:23+]. The wording,
I think, implies that no copy-in/out can be done on the processor's
part, at least not without significant performance impact.}

[307:] After above para, replace NOTEs 12.32 and 12.33 by the following
text:

"NOTE 12.32

Consider the invocation of a procedure

SUBROUTINE SUB(X, J)
  REAL :: X[*]
  INTEGER, INTENT(IN) :: J
  SYNC ALL
  ... = X[J]
  SYNC ALL
  ... ! Calculations on local portion of X
END SUBROUTINE SUB

from the following program fragment:

REAL :: A(1000)[*]
INTEGER :: Q, P
...
P = ...; Q = ...; A = ...
CALL SUB(A(Q), P)

During execution of an invocation of SUB, the executing image has
coindexed access to A(Q) on image P. The values of Q and P might be
different on different images.


NOTE 12.33

 Invocation of a procedure with a nonallocatable coarray dummy argument
 establishes a dummy coarray for the image with locally declared
 cobounds. The image can use these to access either parts or the whole
 of the identified coarray on any other image:

INTERFACE
  SUBROUTINE SUB(X,N)
    INTEGER :: N
    REAL :: X(N,N)[N,*]
  END SUBROUTINE SUB
END INTERFACE
...
REAL :: A(1000)[*]
...
CALL SUB(A,10)

During execution of an invocation of SUB, each executing image has, for
example, access through the syntax X(1,2)[3,4] to A(11) on the image
with image index 33.

NOTE 12.33+1

 For invocation of a procedure with an allocatable coarray dummy
 argument it will often be necessary to perform an allocation
 before any coindexed accesses are done:

 SUBROUTINE CREATE_FIELD(A, FNAME)
   REAL, ALLOCATABLE, INTENT(OUT) :: A(:)[:]
   CHARACTER(*), INTENT(IN) :: FNAME
   INTEGER :: N
   ... ! establish value of N from file FNAME
   ALLOCATE(A(N)[*])
   ... ! read local part of A from FNAME
 END SUBROUTINE

 If this is the case, the procedure must be invoked from all images,
 supplying the same actual argument on each image (6.7.1.2):

 REAL, ALLOCATABLE :: X(:)[:]
 CHARACTER(...) :: FILE = ...

 CALL CREATE_FIELD(X, FILE)

 For the above example, the procedure invocation will synchronize all
 images both at the beginning of its execution (because the coarray
 dummy argument becomes deallocated) and when the ALLOCATE statement
 is executed."

{It might be more appropriate to move all these examples to Appendix
 C.9.}

[310:11+] Add another bullet item
  "(d) the dummy argument is a coarray and the action is a
   coindexed access to its identified coarray executed on any image on
   which it is established."

[310:20+] Add another bullet item
  "(d) the dummy argument is a coarray and the reference is a
   coindexed access to its identified coarray executed on any image on
   which it is established."

{Necessary loosening of anti-aliasing rules.}

[312] After NOTE 12.39 add
  "NOTE 12.39+1
   The exception to the above rules for dummy coarrays enables
   cross-image accesses for them within the procedure, or from
   other procedures that have access to the identified coarray
   (12.5.2.8)"

Open question:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The modified NOTE 12.32 demonstrates that procedure invocations
from different images might associate different coarray actuals
with a given coarray dummy. Furthermore, it is in principle even
possible to perform cross-image accesses from different procedure
contexts.

There exist scenarios where this is either confusing or outright
wrong. For example, a parallel algorithm might implicitly assume that
the actual argument corresponds to the same coarray on each image,
or the procedure might invoke a collective subroutine on its coarray
dummy.

A possible way for the programmer to indicate proper usage might be to
add an attribute that can only be specified for coarray dummies, say

REAL, INTENT(INOUT), SYMMETRIC :: X[*]

The actual argument must then either be a SYMMETRIC dummy, or
the same non-dummy coarray on each image. ALLOCATABLE dummy
coarrays have this attribute by default. The attribute does not,
by itself, enforce that the procedure must be invoked on all images.
Unfortunately, it is probably not compile-time checkable on the
top level.
