NUMBER: F18/026
TITLE: C_SIZEOF argument
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Consider the example
    SUBROUTINE test(b)
      USE iso_c_binding
      REAL(c_double) b(:),a(SIZE(b))
      PRINT *,c_sizeof(a)               ! A
      PRINT *,c_sizeof(b)               ! B
      PRINT *,c_sizeof(a(::2))          ! C
      PRINT *,c_sizeof(a+1)             ! D
      PRINT *,c_sizeof(1.0_c_double)    ! E
    END SUBROUTINE

18.2.3.7 C_SIZEOF (X) states
    "X shall be an interoperable data entity..."

According to that, the reference to C_SIZEOF marked A is valid, as A
is interoperable (an explicit-shape array of interoperable type and
type parameters). And the reference marked B is invalid, as only
explicit-shape arrays and assumed-size arrays are interoperable, thus
assumed-shape arrays are definitely not.

For the references at C and D, the standard seems to be silent on the
matter of whether they are interoperable. It is clear for named
variables, but although subobject designators can denote variables,
they are not names, and expressions are not variables at all. Being
silent implies non-conformance as no interpretation is established.

The reference at E also appears to be non-conforming, as the standard
specifies no criteria for interoperability of expressions.

However, the description of the result of C_SIZEOF only makes use of
the interoperability of the type and type parameters.

Are these references intended to be conforming?
If not, should the standard be clarified to say that X shall be an
interoperable named variable?

ANSWER:

Yes, these references were all intended to be conforming.
An edit is supplied to correct this mistake, with an addition to
require that any pointer or allocatable argument be associated or
allocated.

EDIT to 18-007r1:

    that is associated with an assumed-size array, an unallocated 
    allocatable variable, or a pointer that is not associated."

NUMBER: F18/031
TITLE: CO_BROADCAST with polymorphic argument
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Consider the code fragment

    Subroutine asgn_for_image(a,b,srcimg)
      Class(*) a,b
      Integer,Intent(In) :: srcimg
      ! The assignment A = B is not allowed, so...
      If (This_Image()==srcimg) Then
        Call asgn(b)
      Else
        Call asgn(a)
      End If
    Contains
      Subroutine asgn(x)
        Class(*) x
        Call co_broadcast(x,Source_Image=srcimg)
      End Subroutine
    End Subroutine

There is no requirement forbidding the A argument of CO_BROADCAST
from being polymorphic, so on the face of it, this appears to get
around the prohibition against nonallocatable polymorphic
assignment.

However, CO_BROADCAST states
    "A becomes defined, as if by intrinsic assignment"
but intrinsic assignment is not defined when the variable is a
nonallocatable polymorphic. It can be convincingly argued that
the standard therefore does not establish an interpretation, and
thus the call to CO_BROADCAST is not valid.

Philosophically, it would seem to be strange to allow polymorphic
broadcast across images, but not to allow polymorphic assignment
of a single variable within an image let alone across images.

Is the call to CO_BROADCAST in the example standard-conforming?

(And if so, what are the actual semantics?)

ANSWER:

No, this was not intended to be conforming. Edits are supplied to
correct this.

TITLE: Defining or referencing a coarray component of a dummy argument
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION 1:

On page 311 of 18-007r1, in 15.5.2.13, we have
"While an entity is associated with a dummy argument, the following
restrictions hold.
      ...
(3) Action that affects the value of the entity or any subobject of it
    shall be taken only through the dummy argument unless
     ...
   (d) the dummy argument is a coarray and the action is a coindexed
       definition of the corresponding ultimate argument coarray by a
       different image."

Should there be a similar exception for a coarray that is an ultimate
component of a dummy argument?

QUESTION 2:

On page 312 of 18-007r1, in 15.5.2.13, we have
"While an entity is associated with a dummy argument, the following
restrictions hold.
      ...
(4) If the value of the entity or any subobject of it is affected
    through the dummy argument, then at any time during the invocation
    and execution of the procedure, either before or after the
    definition, it shall be referenced only through that dummy argument

Should there be a similar exception for a coarray that is an ultimate

ANSWERS:

For both questions, the answer is "yes". It was intended that a
subobject of a coarray that is an ultimate component of a dummy
argument may be referenced or defined on another image by coindexing
the corresponding coarray subobject of the actual argument.

NUMBER: F18/036
TITLE:  Array element argument for sequence association
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Paragraph 14 of 15.5.2.4 Ordinary dummy variables states

If the actual argument is a noncoindexed scalar, the corresponding
dummy argument shall be scalar unless
 - the actual argument is default character, of type character with
   the C character kind (18.2.2), or is an element or substring of an
   element of an array that is not an assumed-shape, pointer, or
   polymorphic array,
 - the dummy argument has assumed-rank, or
 - the dummy argument is an assumed-type assumed-size array.

15.5.2.11 Sequence association, paragraphs 2 and 3, say

   "An actual argument represents an element sequence if it is ... an
    array element designator...
    If the dummy argument is not of type character with default or C
    character kind, and the actual argument is an array element
    designator, the element sequence consists of that array element
    and each element that follows it in array element order.

    If the dummy argument is of type character with default or C
    character kind, and has nonzero character length, the storage unit
    sequence is as follows:
    ...
    - if the actual argument is an array element or array element
      substring designator, the storage units starting from the first
      storage unit of the designator and continuing to the end of the
      array;"

Consider
    SUBROUTINE sub2
      CHARACTER(10),TARGET :: a2(20,30)
      CHARACTER(:),POINTER :: p2(:,:)
      p2 => a2(::2,::3)(3:4)
      CALL bad2(p2(1,1))
    END SUBROUTINE
    ! There is no explicit interface here.
    SUBROUTINE bad2(b2)
      CHARACTER b2(*)
      ...
    END SUBROUTINE

15.5.2.11 says that the storage units of b2 are the storage units of
p2 starting from the array element - in this case p2(1,1) - going on
to the end of the array (p2); these are
    a2(1,1)(3:3), a2(1,1)(4:4), a2(3,1)(3:3), a2(3,1)(4:4), ...
which are discontiguous in storage. But as an assumed-size array, b2
is supposed to have contiguous storage units.

If there were an explicit interface, the compiler could gather all the
elements of p2 into a temporary, and pass that, similarly to how it
handles passing p2 itself as an actual argument to an "old style"
dummy array. But there is not, and it would be completely unreasonable
to copy the whole of the rest of p2 starting from some arbitrary array
element into a temporary, when the dummy argument might be scalar.

Q1. Was sequence association for default/C character to the storage
    units of the whole of the rest of the array intended to apply to
    non-contiguous arrays, or was the sequence association intended to
    apply only to the storage units of the array element itself?

Further consider

    SUBROUTINE sub1
      REAL,TARGET :: a(10,20,30)
      REAL,POINTER :: p(:,:,:)
      p => a(::2,::4,::3)
      CALL bad1(p(1,1,1))
    END SUBROUTINE
    SUBROUTINE bad1(b)
      TYPE(*) b(*)
      ...
    END SUBROUTINE

15.5.2.11 says that the element sequence of the actual argument is the
element sequence of the whole array p, starting from the specified
array element - in this case p(1,1,1), i.e.
    p(1,1,1), p(2,1,1),...
But these correspond to the discontiguous array elements
     A(1,1,1), A(3,1,1),...

One cannot do anything much with an assumed-type variable other than
pass it to C, but a C routine is allowed to access all the elements of
an array so passed. That would be difficult in this case unless the
Fortran processor makes a copy of the entire rest of P and pass that
as an argument instead (and copy-back on return if not INTENT(IN)).

Q2. Was sequence association for assumed type to the element sequence
    of the whole of the rest of the array intended to apply to
    non-contiguous arrays, or was the sequence association intended to
    apply only to the array element itself?

ANSWER:

A1. When the array element or array element substring designator is of
    a potentially discontiguous array is passed, only the storage
    units of that array element or substring are intended to be
    passed.

An edit is provided to correct this error.

A2. When an array element of a potentially discontiguous array is
    passed to an assumed-type assumed-size dummy argument, only that
    element is intended to be passed.

An edit is provided to correct this error.

EDITS to 18-007r1:

[310:14] 15.5.2.11 Sequence association, p2,
    After the first sentence, ending "C character kind (18.2.2).",
    insert a paragraph break.
    After that (in was-end-of-p2 now-new-p3), factor out
        "If the dummy argument is not of type character with default
         or C character kind,"
    changing the comma to a colon, and turn those two sentences into
    a bullet list with semicolons.
    After "and the actual argument is an array element designator"
    insert "of a simply contiguous array",
{Avoid the hostages to fortune of listing the allowed ones or the
 disallowed ones, in favour of what property we want the array to
 have.}
    At the end of (was-p2 now-new-p3) append bullet
        "otherwise, if the actual argument is scalar, the element
         sequence consists of that scalar".

This makes the new p3 read
   "If the dummy argument is not of type character with default or C
    character kind:
    - if the actual argument is an array expression, the element
      sequence consists of the elements in array element order;
    - if the actual argument is an array element designator of a
      simply contiguous array, the element sequence consists of that
      array element and each element that follows it in array element
      order;
    - otherwise, if the actual argument is scalar, the element
      sequence consists of that scalar."

[310:19-21] Same subclause, next paragraph (was p3),
    After "substring designator"
    insert "of a simply contiguous array".
    Change the last "if the actual" to "otherwise, if the actual",
    and delete "and not an array ... designator".

This makes the old p3 read
   "If the dummy argument is of type character with default or C
    character kind, and has nonzero character length, the storage unit
    sequence is as follows:
    - if the actual argument is an array expression, the storage units
      of the array;
    - if the actual argument is an array element or array element
      substring designator of a simply contiguous array, the storage
      units starting from the first storage unit of the designator and
      continuing to the end of the array;
    - otherwise, if the actual argument is scalar, the storage units
      of the scalar object."

TITLE: Locality spec limitations
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

BACKGROUND

In 11.1.7.2 Form of the DO construct, C1128 states
  "A <variable-name> that appears in a LOCAL or LOCAL_INIT
   <locality-spec> shall not have the ALLOCATABLE, INTENT (IN), or
   OPTIONAL attribute, shall not be of finalizable type, shall not be
   a nonpointer polymorphic dummy argument, and shall not be a coarray
   or an assumed-size array."

QUESTION:

Q1. Was it intended to allow a variable with an ultimate component of
    finalizable type here?

Q2. Was it intended to allow a variable with a coarray ultimate
    component here?

Q3. Was it intended to allow a variable with an allocatable ultimate
    component here?

ANSWER:

A variable with an ultimate allocatable component was not intended to
be allowed here. All the questions above involve such a component.

TITLE:  SIZE= with no reason
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Fortran 2018 permits SIZE= in an input statement without ADVANCE=.
SIZE= assigns to its variable the number of character transferred by
edit descriptors.

This means that SIZE= is also allowed for list-directed and namelist
input/output, but no edit descriptor is involved, so this will always
assign the value zero to the variable.

For example,
    READ(*,*,SIZE=N) X
    PRINT *,N ! Always prints zero.

Was this superfluous additional way of assigning zero to an integer
variable deliberately added?

ANSWER:

No, this was not a deliberate addition.
An edit is provided to remove this inadvertent feature.

QUESTION:

Consider the following program:

program recu_caf_1
    call csub( 1 )
contains
    recursive subroutine csub ( depth )
        integer :: depth
        real, allocatable :: x[:]
        integer :: k
        
        if (this_image() == depth) then

        end if                  
    end subroutine
end program

Q1: Is program recu_caf_1 standard-conforming?
    It establishes a single coarray on each image, but at different
    recursion depths on each image, so the question is really whether
    these correspond (each recursion level has its own set of unsaved
    local variables).

Q2: If the SAVE attribute is added to the declaration of coarray "x"
    in the example, does that make the program standard-conforming?
    (There is only one saved variable, shared with each recursion
    level.)

ANSWER:

A1: No, unsaved local variables are different at each level, and it
    was intended that coarrays at the same level correspond.
    An edit is provided to clarify this.

A2: Yes, the modified program is standard-conforming.

NUMBER: F18/040
TITLE: Allocating a dummy argument with a coarray ultimate component
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

On page 134 of 18-007r1, 9.7.1.2, para 3, we have
"If an allocation specifies a coarray, its dynamic type and the values 
of corresponding type parameters shall be the same on every active image 
in the current team. The values of corresponding bounds and 
corresponding cobounds shall be the same on those images. If the coarray 
is a dummy argument, its ultimate argument (15.5.2.3) shall be the same 
coarray on those images."  
Should there be a similar restriction for a coarray that is an ultimate  
component of a dummy argument? For example, does the following program
conform to the standard?

program test
   type new
      real, allocatable :: a[:]
   end type
   integer :: i
   type(new) x,y 
   if(this_image()<=2) then
      call work(x)
   else   
      call work(y)
   end if
   sync all
   if (this_image()==2)then
      do i = 1, num_images()
         x%a[i] = i
      end do   
   end if
   sync all
   if (this_image()==4)then
      do i = 1, num_images()
         write(*,*) i, y%a[i]
      end do   
   end if      
contains  
   subroutine work(z)
      type(new) :: z 
      allocate (z%a[*])
   end subroutine       
end program 

Here, the calls of subroutine work create a coarray that is accessible 
on images 1 and 2 as x%a[i] and on other images as y%a[i]. Was this
intended?

ANSWER:

A similar restriction was intended. It was not intended to allow the 
creation of a coarray that is accessible in a scope as an ultimate
component of one object on some images and as an ultimate component of 
another object on other images. 

An edit is provided. We have taken the opportunity to change "same" in
the quoted text to "corresponding". Coarrays on different images cannot 
be the same, but they can correspond, see 5.4.7. We need the concept of
"same" for objects of a type with coarray ultimate components. It seems
appropriate to require that they be declared with the same name in the 
same set of statements. 

EDIT to 18-007r1:

[134:16-17] In 9.7.1.2 Execution of an ALLOCATE statement, para 3, 
replace the final sentence by the two sentences
"If the coarray is a dummy argument, the ultimate arguments (15.5.2.3) 
on those images shall be corresponding coarrays. If the coarray is an 
ultimate component of a dummy argument, the ultimate arguments on those
images shall be declared with the same name in the same scoping unit and
if in a recursive procedure at the same depth of recursion."

NUMBER: F18/041
TITLE: NULL() passed to assumed-rank dummy
KEYWORDS: NULL, assumed-rank
DEFECT TYPE: Erratum
STATUS: Passed by J3 letter ballot

QUESTION:

Consider:

  call foo(null())
contains
  subroutine foo(x)
    integer, pointer, intent(in) :: x(..)
    print *, rank(x)
  end subroutine
end 

What should be printed? According to Table 16.5 (Characteristics of
the result of NULL()), the actual argument has the rank of "the 
corresponding dummy argument". In this case, however, the corresponding
dummy has no defined rank, instead taking its rank from the actual
argument. Was this intended to be undefined?

ANSWER:

No, this combination was intended to be non-conforming.
An edit is provided to correct this mistake.

EDITS to 18-007r1:

[400:33] 16.9.144 NULL, p6 "If the context...",
         Add a new sentence to the end of the paragraph:
   "If the context of the reference to NULL is an <actual argument>
    corresponding to an <assumed-rank> dummy argument, MOLD shall be
    present."
{Add restriction. It could also be appended to p5, or be a new para.}
