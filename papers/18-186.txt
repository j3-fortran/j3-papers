Subject: Trailing blanks in a hexadecimal-significand input field
Date: 2018-June-11
Reference: 18-168 (item GB030)

Clarification:

The description of a hexadecimal-significand input field does not
account for trailing blanks.

Edit to N2146:

On page 273, subclause 13.7.2.3.2 F editing, para 7:
In the sentence "Embedded blanks are not permitted in a hexadecimal-
significand number.", add "; trailing blanks are ignored" at the end.

After the change, the sentence should read:

"Embedded blanks are not permitted in a hexadecimal-significand
number; trailing blanks are ignored."
