Issue 86  [42: 1-10]
Issue 203 [42:18-21]

1. Issue 86

Issue 86 asks why the combination of SEQUENCE and BIND(C) in the
definition of a derived type is prohibited. The reason is that the
requirements of BIND(C) and the requirements of SEQUENCE with respect
to storage could be in conflict. We want however to retain the
functionality given by the SEQUENCE property of having data entities
declared in different scoping units with reference to different
derived-type definition with the same name, to be the same. This
functionality is retained by giving it to the BIND attribute.

[54:29] Change "have the SEQUENCE property," to

"all have the SEQUENCE property or all have the BIND(C) attribute,"

[54:32] After "the SEQUENCE property" insert

"or with the BIND(C) attribute"

[75:22+] Add J3 note

/begin J3 note/
The previous paragraph has to be changed, following the addition of
the 'BIND(C) attribute' edit to (4.5.2). As the paragraph stands, it
does not allow data entities with the BIND(C) attribute, which are
declared in different scoping units with reference to different
derived-type definition with the same name, to be the same. Thus the
paragraph has either to be fixed, or deleted.
/end J3 note/

2. Issue 203

Issue 203 asks why procedure pointers are prohibited from having the
BIND(C) attribute. The reason is that the design of C-Fortran
interoperability does not allow the interoperation of Fortran and C
pointers. Note that the passing of a C-pointer to a procedure from
Fortran to C is possible through the use of the C_LOC intrinsic
function, with as argument a procedure with a BIND(C) attribute. This
note is added as edit to the section on procedure pointers
(12.3.2.3).

[272:17+] Add note and renumber notes:

/begin standard note/
A procedure pointer can not interoperate with a C pointer. However, it
is possible to pass a C pointer to a procedure from Fortran to C
through the use of the C_LOC function, accessible from the
ISO_C_BINDING module. The argument of the C_LOC function is then a
procedure with a BIND(C) attribute.
/end standard note/
