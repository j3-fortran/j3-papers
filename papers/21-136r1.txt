This paper suggests a new feature, and as such, it must be for Fortran 202y
(or later). We have not yet started accepting features for F202y, and so
discussion of the technical merits at this time would be premature.
Therefore, there will be no action on this paper at this meeting.

Discussion
----------

A useful strategy to avoid allocatable variables is to calculate (or
read) size(s) or length(s) of variable(s), and then declare the
variable(s) in a BLOCK construct as automatic variables. E.g.,

  read ( *, * ) M, N
  block
    character(m) :: C
    real :: A(4*n,4*n), B(n)
    ....

If one wants to read (or write) the variables using NAMELIST, the
NAMELIST declaration cannot be outwith the block, because the variables
declared within the block do not exist outwith the block, and it cannot
be within the block because that's prohibited.

If one wants to preserve the utility of automatic variables, the
alternative is to put the NAMELIST statement and the READ (or WRITE)
statement within an internal subroutine.

The variables must be passed to the internal subroutine as arguments,
because the internal subroutine cannot be defined within the BLOCK
construct, and therefore the internal subroutine cannot access them by
host association.

Paper 06-376r1 points out that the existing description of the NAMELIST
statement specifies that if a <namelist-group-name> therein is the same
as the <namelist-group-name> in another NAMELIST statement in the same
scoping unit, the <namelist-group-object-list> extends that namelist
group, and argues that this could be viewed as either weird or
confusing.

Proposal
--------

Allow a NAMELIST statement within a BLOCK construct. Specify that it
declares construct entities identified by its <namelist-group-name>s.
Because they are construct entities, they do not extend namelist groups
that are declared outwith the BLOCK; they are different entities,
exactly the same as would be the case for a NAMELIST statement that
appears within an internal subroutine.

This new definition of the effect of a NAMELIST statement does not
conflict with existing practice because NAMELIST statements are
presently prohibited within BLOCK constructs.

Edits (to guage the scope)
--------------------------

[Introduction: Input/Output or Data declaration?] Add a sentence:

"NAMELIST statements within BLOCK constructs declare namelist groups
that are construct entities."

[122:14-16 8.9p3 NAMELIST statement] Replace the paragraph:

"Any <namelist-group-name> may occur more than once in the NAMELIST
statements in a scoping unit. If the <namelist-group-name> identifies
another accessible namelist group that is an entity of the same scoping
unit, the <namelist-group-object-list> following each successive
appearance of the same <namelist-group-name> is treated as a
continuation of the list for that namelist group.

  NOTE 0.5
    A NAMELIST statement within a BLOCK construct declares a namelist
    group that is a construct entity.
"

[182:11 11.1.4 BLOCK construct C1107] Remove "NAMELIST," from C1107.

[182:21 11.1.4p2+ BLOCK construct] Append a sentence:

"Each <namelist-group-name> in a NAMELIST statement within a BLOCK
construct declares a namelist group, identified by that
<namelist-group-name>, that is a construct entity of that BLOCK
construct."

{No change is needed in 19.4p3.}

Alternative Edits
-----------------

[182:11 11.1.4 BLOCK construct C1107] Remove "NAMELIST," from C1107.

[182:12+ 11.1.4 BLOCK construct C1107+] Insert a constraint:

"C1107a A <namelist-group-name> in a NAMELIST statement that appears within
        a BLOCK construct shall not be the same as a <namelist-group-name>
        from the containing scope."
