         SYNC TEAM, IMAGE_TEAM, NULL_IMAGE_TEAM

Reference: J3/06-007r1, J3/06-252r2
Dependencies: UTI 89

Issues 86 (page 198), 87 (page 437), 90 (page 436) and 73 (page 436)
raise concerns that can all be addressed by making IMAGE_TEAM be an
extensible derived type with default initialization to an empty image
set.

1. Discussion of issue 86 (page 198)

The text for SYNC TEAM already requires that the image executing
the statement be a member of the team, see [197:18-19]. This
automatically prohibits an empty set of images. Undefined image
teams are also prohibited by [197:19-20]. If IMAGE_TEAM is default
initialized then there can never be an object of type IMAGE_TEAM that
is undefined. The value is either an empty image set or explicitly
assigned by FORM_TEAM. Edits are provided for this.

2. Discussion of issue 87 (page 437)

The constant NULL_IMAGE_TEAM was introduced in response to issue 40
by J3/06-252r2, which said: 

"Yes, it would be a good idea to add INQUIRE(TEAM=). For symmetry with 
OPEN, it should return a scalar of type IMAGE_TEAM. We will need a null
value for the case where the unit or file is not connected. Since the 
user will need to know the list of images involved, we also need to add 
an intrinsic that is given a scalar of type IMAGE_TEAM and returns the
list of image indices."

UTI 087 proposes that the derived type IMAGE_TEAM be default initialized
to be an emtpy set of images. This would void the need to have a named
constant for this purpose. We agree. One can test for an empty team
using (SIZE(TEAM_IMAGES(team))==0). The edits reflect this.

3. Discussion of Issue 90 (page 436).

The type IMAGE_TEAM is an extensible type. An edit makes this clear.
Subgroup discussed whether it should have pointer or allocatable
components, and concluded that all that matters is that it is made clear
that a value should used for its intended purpose only on the image on
which it was created. This is in case the processor uses pointer
components.

Note to editor:
We should make it clear that derived types defined in the standard
(C_PTR, C_FUNPTR, IEEE_*, and IMAGE_TEAM) do not have co-array
components. A note indicating they do not have BIND(C) or SEQUENCE
and that they are extensible may also be helpful.

4. Discussion of Issue 73 (page 436).

We do not want to allow use of values of type IMAGE_TEAM across images
(see UTI 89). Not even as an argument to TEAM_IMAGES, and certainly
not as arguments to the SYNC statements. The data describing the team
may contain image-specific information that cannot be interpreted by
other images. This allows maximal implementation flexibility and we
do not see it as restricting the programmer in any significant way.

---------------------------
Edits to J3/06-007r1
---------------------------

[252:8] Change 'NULL_IMAGE_TEAM (13.8.3.13)' to 'that identifies
an empty image set'.

[430:1-2] Change the sentence "The value of TEAM_IMAGES..." to:
"For a value of TEAM that identifies an empty image set, 
the result is an array of size zero."

[436:9] Replace the second sentence "It shall have..." with:
"The type IMAGE_TEAM has only private components, 
has no co-array components, and has default initialization to a value that 
identifies an empty image set."

[436:9+] At the end of 13.8.3.7 IMAGE_TEAM add
NOTE 13.25a
When values of type IMAGE_TEAM are constructed by calling the intrinsic 
subroutine FORM_TEAM on the images of a team, the processor may choose to store 
information in each to speed later processing of team synchronizations and 
collective subroutine calls. Since this information is likely to vary between 
images, it is inappropriate to copy values of type IMAGE_TEAM between images. 
For this reason, co-arrays of type IMAGE_TEAM are not permitted and if a value 
is copied from one image to another, the value becomes undefined except on the 
image on which it was created.
END NOTE

[437:21-23] Delete subclause 13.8.3.13
