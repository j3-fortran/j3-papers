Introduction:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This paper addresses two issues concerning upper cobounds.

Issue 1:

The definition of upper cobounds in the standard appears to be
distributed across multiple places.

The base definition is in 8.5.6 CODIMENSION attribute. There,
the last upper cobound is always excluded. This definition is
sufficient to establish the mapping between coindices and image
index in the current team (or, more generally with the rules
from 9.6, in any specified team).

In 16.9.197 UCOBOUND [439:10-11], this is extended by also
defining the final upper cobound, a run time property, since
obtaining it requires knowledge of the number of executing images.
This makes sense because UCOBOUND needs to be able to return
an array of size corank its argument, but is a bit confusing or
even incorrect when considering references to cobounds in other
places in the standard. It appears that everywhere except
in the definition of UCOBOUND, the first definition is
targeted. This also has an impact on the NOTE suggested in
17-195, because its contention that

"A coarray that is established when a CHANGE TEAM statement
is executed will retain its corank and cobounds inside the
block construct."

would be wrong if the final upper cobound (which will in general
change its value going into a CHANGE TEAM block) is included.

Note that 9.6 para 4 constrains the program to use valid image
indices, implicitly constraining also the coindex in the
final codimension.

Edits are suggested to make a clearer distinction between the
two cases.


Issue 2:

The behaviour of UCOBOUND inside a CHANGE TEAM construct, when
applied to a coarray established in an ancestor team, is not
in line with that of other intrinsics like NUM_IMAGES(), which
by default refer to the current team. For example, in

integer :: j[*], id
type(team_type) :: split

id = ...
form team(id, split) ! images 1 and 2 belong to team 1,
                     ! images 3 and 4 belong to team 2

change team(split)
  write(*, *) ucobound(j)
  if ( this_image() .eq. num_images() ) then
    if ( any( this_image( j ) .ne. ucobound( j ) ) ) &
         error stop "Should never get here!"
  end if

end team

executed with 4 images, the write statement executed by all
images will print 4, although each team current at the statement
only has 2 images.
Also some programmers like to add assertions for checking such
as the one after the write statement, which would be triggered
against expectation.
While one can work around this by by using a coarray association
(because that is established in the construct only), or by calling
a subroutine (because a coarray dummy argument is established in
the team current at invocation only), we prefer to change the
UCOBOUND semantics to refer to the current team instead of that
of its argument's establishment. We believe this will make
UCOBOUND more useful inside CHANGE TEAM constructs.
Also, if it is desired to add optional TEAM= or TEAM_NUMBER=
arguments to UCOBOUND in a future standard, this can be
accomplished without introducing an incompatible change.


Edits to N2137:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Introduction, para 2, page xx, heading "Changes to features
 previously described by ISO/IEC TS 18508:2015:" add text at
 the end of the bullet:
"The intrinsic function UCOBOUND produces a final upper cobound
 that is always relative to the current team."

Section 5.4.7 Coarray, page 45, add the following text to NOTE 5.10:
"A corank n coarray has n lower and n-1 upper cobounds (8.5.6).
 A value for the upper cobound of the final codimension can be
 obtained by the program through invoking the UCOBOUND intrinsic;
 calculating this requires knowledge of the number of executing
 images in the current team. This final upper cobound is otherwise
 not included when this document references the term ''cobounds''."

Section 16.9.197 UCOBOUND [438:36] replace
"Description: Upper cobound(s) of a coarray."
with
"Description: Upper cobound(s) of a coarray, including that for the
 final codimension."

Section 16.9.197 UCOBOUND [439:11] replace
"team current when COARRAY was established"
with
"current team"
so that the complete sentence reads:
"The final upper cobound is the final cosubscript in the cosubscript
 list for the coarray that selects the image whose index is equal to
 the number of images in the current team."

Final comment:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The example [439:16-19] implicitly assumes the corrected semantics.
If the issue 2 part of this paper is rejected, it would need to be
fixed.
