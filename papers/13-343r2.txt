Discussion - Responses with edits
---------------------------------

{Van 16}: At [15:3-4] lines are wider than the margins. This needs to
be fixed in the LaTeX sources.

{Van 32}: At [21:7] The KIND of the COUNT argument in EVENT_QUERY
should only require that it can hold any default integer value.

{Dan 8}: For status values at [21:10-12] change from zero/nonzero to
positive. These are errors, so positive is appropriate.

{Ed}: In the discussion of EVENT_QUERY the phrases "invocation is
successful/unsuccessful" are not consistent with usage elsewhere.
Response: Change to refer to error conditions. Edits are provided.

{Ed}: Instead of writing an argument "becomes defined with" or "is
given the value", instead write "is assigned the value".

------------------------------------

{Nick 12}: 7.4.11 p21 It needs to say that EVENT_QUERY may be used in
segments that are unordered with respect to EVENT POST on the same
variable.
Response: The segment ordering rules say nothing of EVENT_QUERY, so we
see no need for this. Note 7.1 makes it clear that EVENT_QUERY does
not imply any synchronization.

{Reinhold, A.2.4}: In THIS_IMAGE can the coarray argument and DISTANCE
argument both be supplied?
Response:  No. The syntax at [31:2] does not allow this.

--------------

[15:3-4] {Van 16} Adjust line lengths in the LaTeX sources to fit in
margins. {Ed: Done}

[21:7] {Van 32} Change "of type default integer" to "of type integer
with a decimal range no smaller that that of default integer".

[21:7-8] {Ed} Change "the invocation is successful" to "no error
condition occurs".

[21:8-9] {Ed} In the COUNT description change "COUNT becomes defined
with the difference between the number of successful posts and
successful waits for EVENT" to "COUNT is assigned the value of the
number of successful posts minus the number of successful waits for
EVENT."

[21:9] {Ed} In the last sentence of the COUNT description, change "it
is given the value 0" to "it is assigned the value 0".

[21:10-11] {Ed} In the third sentence of the STATUS description,
