Subject:   New work item proposal: Purity enhancement
Date: 2015 August 04
Reference: 15-007r2, 14-237r2

1. Discussion
=============

(1) There appears to be no reason that the procedures in ISO_C_Binding,
    other than C_F_POINTER, are not pure.

    That they are impure can cause cascades of impurity.

(2) What's wrong with a VALUE argument of a pure function appearing in
    the contexts prohibited by C1296?  That it is prohibited seems to be
    collateral damage caused by prohibiting pointer argument
    modification; prohibiting VALUE serves no productive purpose.

2. Proposal
===========

(1) Specify that procedures in ISO_C_Binding, other than C_F_POINTER,
    are pure, viz.

    C_ASSOCIATED
    C_F_PROCPOINTER
    C_FUNLOC
    C_LOC
    C_SIZE0F

    The reason for not making C_F_POINTER pure is that we would like to
    constrain against doing things with FPTR, in the same way we do for
    pointers, but the best we can do is prohibit them.  One goal of the
    description of PURE procedures was to constrain against all impure
    behavior.

(2) Permit modification of VALUE arguments in a pure function.

3. Edits
========

[xviii] Under "Intrinsic procedures and modules," append a sentence "All
standard procedures in the ISO_C_BINDING intrinsic module, other than
C_F_POINTER, are now pure."

[xviii] Under "Program units and procedures", append a sentence "A dummy
argument of a PURE function is permitted in a variable definition
context, and other contexts, if it has the VALUE attribute."

[318:29 C1296] Before the first "dummy argument" insert "pointer".

[319:2 C1296(6)] Delete "or"

[319:3 C1296(7)] Replace the full stop with ", or"

[319:7+ C1296(7)+] Insert a list item

" (8) as the actual argument to the function C_LOC from the
      ISO_C_BINDING intrinsic module.

[452:20 15.2.3.1p1] Append a sentence: "The C_F_POINTER subroutine is
impure; all other procedures in the module are pure."
